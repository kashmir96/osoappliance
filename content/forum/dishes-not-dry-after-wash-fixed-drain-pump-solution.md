    > Hi there! To better assist you with diagnosing the issue with your dishwasher, could you answer a few questions for me? Is the heating element working correctly? Is air circulating properly through the dishwasher?

    > That could be the cause of the dishes not drying. If water is still present in the dishwasher after the cycle is finished, it could be a issue with the drain pump. The drain pump is responsible for removing water from the dishwasher. Try checking the drain pump to see if it needs to be repaired or replaced.

    > Thank you for the suggestion! I checked the drain pump and it was indeed the issue. I repaired it and now the dishes are drying properly.

Solution: The problem with the dishes not drying was resolved by fixing the dishwasher's drain pump issue that was causing water to remain in the dishwasher after the cycle was finished.
