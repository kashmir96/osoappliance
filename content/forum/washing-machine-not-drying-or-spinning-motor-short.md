# Washing Machine Not Drying or Spinning

> I have a washing machine that is not spinning or drying properly. It is not making any noise and the control panel seems to have power. I tried to look at the back to see if the motor is spinning, but I am unable to tell. Can anyone help me diagnose the issue?

> Checking the motor brushes and belt will require some disassembly of the machine, so it may be best to call a technician if you are not experienced with repairing appliances. 
> In the meantime, you can try unplugging the machine and checking the drain pump for any clogs. If the pump is clear, you can try restarting the machine to see if that fixes the problem.
