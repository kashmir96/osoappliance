> Hi there! To better assist you with diagnosing the issue with your dishwasher, could you answer a few questions for me? Is the heating element working correctly? Is air circulating properly through the dishwasher?

> That could definitely be the cause of the dishes not drying. The heating element is responsible for drying the dishes. If it's not working properly, the dishes won't dry. You may need to replace the heating element.

Solution: The problem with the dishes not drying was resolved by replacing the dishwasher's damaged heating element.
