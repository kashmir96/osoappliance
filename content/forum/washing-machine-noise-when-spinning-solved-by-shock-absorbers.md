> Hi there! To better diagnose the issue, can you tell me what kind of noise it's making? Is it a knocking noise or more like a jet engine sound?

> Worn shock absorbers are definitely a common issue when it comes to washing machine noise. I'd also recommend checking the bearings and motor brushes, just in case.

> Update: I had a repair technician come out and it turns out it was the shock absorbers causing the knocking noise. They replaced the shock absorbers and the washing machine is now running smoothly.
