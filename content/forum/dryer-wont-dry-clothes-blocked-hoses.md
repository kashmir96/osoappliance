# Dryer Won't Dry Clothes

> I've been having trouble getting my dryer to dry my clothes properly. It's taking multiple cycles to get even basic loads completely dry. I'm not sure what's causing the issue, but I'm hoping someone can help me figure it out.

> Thanks for posting your question! There are a lot of different things that could be causing your dryer to not dry your clothes. Can you give us some more details about what's happening? For example, is the dryer spinning? Does it feel warm to the touch? And have you noticed any issues with the condenser filling up?

> If you're not sure about the condenser filling up, you can try taking a look at the condenser unit and seeing if there's any visible build-up. That could be causing the issue. Another thing to check would be whether the vent or the hoses leading to the dryer are blocked - that could prevent the hot air from circulating properly.

> That's a good idea. Another possibility is that the reservoir leading to the condenser is blocked - that can also cause problems with the hot air circulating properly. So you might want to check that as well.

> Thanks for the suggestion, Mike. I took a look at the condenser unit and the reservoir, and it turns out that there was some build-up in the hoses that was preventing the hot air from circulating properly. I cleaned it out, and now my dryer is working much better!
