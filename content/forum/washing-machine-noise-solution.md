# Washing Machine Makes High Pitch Noise on Spin

> Hello everyone, I recently started hearing a high pitch noise coming from my washing machine during the spin cycle. The noise seems to be getting louder and I'm not sure what the issue is. Can anyone help me diagnose the problem?

> Hi! Can you describe the noise in more detail? Does it happen all the time or just during certain parts of the spin cycle?

> It could be due to a few things, such as worn motor brushes, a noisy motor, or worn bearings. Can you check if the feet of the washing machine are level? This can also be a potential cause if the machine is not level.

> Update: I had a technician come out to take a look at my washing machine. They said it's just an old motor and will eventually need to be replaced, but for now it can be left as is. Thank you for all of your suggestions and help!
