# Oven not heating at all

<p>Hi everyone, I'm having some trouble with my oven. It's not heating at all, it just stays cold. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, could you give me some guidance on what I should do?</p>

> Hi there, sorry to hear about your oven trouble. Could you give us some more details on what you are experiencing? Is the heating element working properly? Have you checked the thermostat? It could also be an issue with the door seal. Please let us know.

> Hi WasherWarren73, thanks for your response. I'm not sure if the heating element is working properly, and I'm not sure how to check the thermostat. The door seal could be an issue, but I'm not sure how to check that either.

> Hi there, to check the heating element, turn on your oven and see if it's getting hot. If it's not getting hot, it's likely a heating element issue. To check the thermostat, you can use a multimeter to test it for continuity. As for the door seal, you can visually inspect it to make sure it's not damaged or worn. Please let us know what you find.

> Hi there, based on the symptoms you described, it sounds like the issue with your oven not heating at all is due to a faulty thermostat. I recommend replacing the thermostat to see if that solves the issue. Please let us know how it goes!
