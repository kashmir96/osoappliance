    > Hi there! Can you provide more details about your dishwasher not filling with water? For example, have you noticed any water leaks or is the water not filling the dishwasher at all?

    > Alright, thank you for the information. There are a few potential causes for this issue such as a clogged inlet valve or a hose issue. Can you check if the hose is connected correctly and if the inlet valve is clogged?
