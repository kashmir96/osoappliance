> Thanks for the update. In this case, the issue may be with the hose itself. Can you inspect the hose and see if there are any signs of damage or a slow leak?

> I've checked and it looks like there is a slow leak behind the machine. The hose has become perforated somehow.

### Technician

> That's likely the cause of the leak. I would recommend having a technician come and replace the hose for you. After the replacement, your dishwasher should work properly again.
