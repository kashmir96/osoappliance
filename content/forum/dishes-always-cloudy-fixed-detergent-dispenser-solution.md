> Hi there! To better assist you with diagnosing the issue with your dishwasher, could you answer a few questions for me? Is the spray arm clogged in any way? Is the filter dirty? Is the detergent dispenser working correctly?

> That could be the cause of the cloudy dishes. The detergent dispenser needs to be functioning properly in order for the dishes to come out clean. Try fixing the dispenser to see if that resolves the issue.

Solution: The problem with the dishes always being cloudy was resolved by fixing the dishwasher's detergent dispenser.
