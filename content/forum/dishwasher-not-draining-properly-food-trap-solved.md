# Dishwasher Not Draining Properly

<p>I recently noticed that my dishwasher is not draining properly. I've checked and it's not a clogged drain hose, so I'm wondering if it's a pump issue. Can someone help me diagnose the problem and find a solution?</p>

> To check if the pump is working properly, you can remove the lower dish rack and inspect the bottom of the dishwasher for any debris. If you see anything stuck, like food or other debris, try to remove it and see if that fixes the issue.
