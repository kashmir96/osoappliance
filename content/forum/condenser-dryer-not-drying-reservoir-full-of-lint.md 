    # Condenser Dryer Not Drying
    <p>I have a condenser dryer that is not drying my clothes properly. What could be the potential causes for this issue? I've heard about blocked hoses, a blocked or faulty condenser, a blocked vent, a blocked reservoir leading to the condenser, not heating, and a faulty thermostat. Can anyone help me diagnose the problem and find a solution?</p>

    > Yes, the condenser does fill up. It does feel warm to the touch, but the dryer isn't spinning as well as it should be. And no, I don't believe I am overloading it.

    > Thank you for the information. Based on what you've described, it could be a few different things. It's possible that the reservoir is full of lint, which can restrict the flow of air and reduce the dryer's performance. It's also possible that there's a problem with the heating element, the thermostat, or one of the other components. To determine the root cause of the problem, I would recommend calling an appliance repair technician to take a look.

    > I completely agree with OvenOracle21. It's always best to get a professional to diagnose appliance issues, especially when it comes to electrical components. They will have the tools and expertise to quickly determine what's causing the problem and find a solution.
