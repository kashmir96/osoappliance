> Hi there, sorry to hear that you're having issues with your dryer. To better help you, could you answer a few questions for me? Is the dryer spinning when you turn it on? Are you overloading the dryer? Have you cleaned the lint trap recently?

> Thanks for the additional info. Have you checked if the condenser is filling up? And is the dryer warm to the touch when it's on?

> Based on what you've said, it sounds like there might be a blockage somewhere in the dryer, possibly in the hoses or vent. Can you check for any blockages there?

> That's definitely a possibility. A faulty thermostat could cause the dryer to not heat up properly. If you have a multimeter, you can check if the thermostat is working properly.
