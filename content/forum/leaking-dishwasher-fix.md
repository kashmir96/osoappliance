# Leaking Dishwasher Making a Mess on the Floor

<p>I have a problem with my dishwasher that is making a mess on my kitchen floor. I have no idea what's causing the issue, but I think it's time to ask for help from the experts. I would really appreciate it if someone could help me figure out what's going wrong and how to fix it. </p>

> Hi there! Can you give me some more information about the issue you're experiencing with your dishwasher? For example, when did you first notice the leak and has it gotten worse over time?

> I first noticed the leak a few weeks ago and it hasn't gotten any worse since then. It only happens when I run the dishwasher and it's making a big mess on my kitchen floor.

> OK, I see. Can you also check if the hoses are connected correctly and if the seal around the door is damaged in any way?

> After speaking with my husband, we realized that the problem was caused by using too much soap in the dishwasher. This was creating suds that went on the floor and caused the leaking. We have since stopped using as much soap and have not had any further issues. Thank you for your help!

> Great! I'm glad to hear that the issue has been resolved. Overusing soap can definitely cause the dishwasher to leak, so it's important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for how much to use. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask!
