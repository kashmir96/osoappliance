    > Thanks for posting your question! There are a lot of different things that could be causing your dryer to leave your clothes smelling strange. Can you give us some more details about what kind of smell it is? For example, is it a burning smell or a wet clothes smell?

    > It's not really a burning smell or a wet clothes smell. It's more like a strange, musty odor. It's hard to describe.

    > If it's a musty odor, that could be a sign of mold or mildew in the drum or seal of the dryer. Have you checked to see if there's any visible mold or mildew in there?

    > Another possibility is that the issue is caused by a mouldy interior in the dryer. This can happen when the door is kept closed after use, and the moisture inside the dryer isn't allowed to escape. Have you been leaving the door open after using the dryer?

    # Solution: Mouldy Interior Due to Not Leaving Door Open
    <p>After consulting with the technicians, it turns out that the issue was caused by a mouldy interior in the dryer. This can happen when the door is kept closed after use, and the moisture inside the dryer isn't allowed to escape. The solution was to leave the door open after using the dryer, to allow the moisture to escape. This has helped to resolve the issue, and my clothes don't smell strange anymore.</p>
