# Oven not getting hot

<p>Hi everyone, I'm having some trouble with my oven. It's blowing hot air but it's taking ages to get hot and barely getting hot at all. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, could you give me some guidance on what I should do?</p>

> Hi there, sorry to hear about your oven trouble. Could you give us some more details on what you are experiencing? Is the heating element working properly? Have you checked the thermostat? It could also be an issue with the door seal. Please let us know.

> Hi WasherWizard_Mike11, thanks for your response. I'm not sure if the heating element is working properly, and I'm not sure how to check the thermostat. The door seal could be an issue, but I'm not sure how to check that either.

> Hi there, you can check the heating element by turning on your oven and feeling the heat. If the heating element is working properly, it should feel hot to the touch. To check the thermostat, you can use a multimeter to test it for continuity. As for the door seal, you can visually inspect it to make sure it's not damaged or worn. Please let us know what you find.

> Hi there, it sounds like the issue with your oven not getting hot could be due to the missing part of the door seal. The seal is there to keep the heat inside the oven and if it's damaged or missing, it can affect the oven's ability to get hot. I recommend replacing the door seal to see if that solves the issue. Let us know how it goes!
