> Thank you for the information. A whirring sound in a washing machine can be caused by several things such as motor brushes, a noisy motor, worn bearings, or worn shock absorbers. Can you check if the feet of the machine are level?

> In that case, it's possible that the motor brushes are worn or installed backwards. This can cause a whirring noise in the machine. I recommend calling a professional to take a look and fix the issue.
