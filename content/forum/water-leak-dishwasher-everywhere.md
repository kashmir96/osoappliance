> Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your dishwasher issue. Before we troubleshoot further, can you please answer a few questions? Are the hoses connected correctly to the dishwasher and to the sink? Also, is there any damage to the seal around the door?

> Yes, the hoses are connected correctly. As for the seal around the door, I just checked and it appears to be damaged and worn out.

> That could be the issue then. A damaged or worn out seal can cause water to leak from the dishwasher. You may want to consider ordering a replacement seal and replacing it following a guide or video tutorial.

The solution to the dishwasher leaking water during the wash cycle was a worn out seal around the door. The author ordered a replacement seal and replaced it following a guide on YouTube.
