> Thanks for the info. A washing machine not drying or spinning can have several potential causes, including motor brushes, a belt, the motor, a drain pump, or a motor controller. Could you check if there is any debris or obstruction in the drain pump?

> Hi WasherWizard_Mike11, I just checked and there was a sock blocking the drain pump. I removed it and the machine is now working fine. Thank you for your help!
