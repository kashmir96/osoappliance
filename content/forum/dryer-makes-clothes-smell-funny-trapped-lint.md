> Thanks for posting your question! There are a lot of different things that could be causing your dryer to make your clothes smell funny. Can you give us some more details about what kind of smell it is? For example, is it a burning smell or a wet clothes smell?

> If it's a musty odor, that could be a sign of mold or mildew in the drum or seal of the dryer. Have you checked to see if there's any visible mold or mildew in there?

# Solution: Trapped Lint
    <p>After consulting with the technicians, it turns out that the issue was likely caused by trapped lint or debris in the dryer. I cleaned out the lint trap and the vent, and that seems to have resolved the issue - my clothes don't smell weird anymore!</p>
