# Loud Washing Machine Spinning

<p>I have a problem with my washing machine. When it's in the spinning cycle, it makes a very loud noise. I'm not sure what the issue could be. Can anyone help me diagnose the problem and find a solution?</p>

> Hi there! Can you describe the noise a bit more specifically? Is it a knocking noise or a roaring noise?

> A roaring noise during the spinning cycle can be caused by a few things. It could be due to worn bearings or worn shock absorbers. Could you also check if the feet of the washing machine are level?

> I found out that the loud noise was coming from the bearings. My husband watched some YouTube videos and was able to solve the problem by purchasing some appliance parts online. Thank you for your help!
