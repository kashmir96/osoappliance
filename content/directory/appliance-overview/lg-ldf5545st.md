The LG LDF5545ST Dishwasher is a top-of-the-line dishwasher that offers a range of features to make cleaning dishes easier. This model has many modern and innovative features to make it one of the best dishwashers around.

The first and most obvious feature is the size. The LG LDF5545ST Dishwasher is large enough to hold up to 15 place settings, making it ideal for larger households.

For example, there are cycles specifically designed for heavily soiled pots and pans or delicate items like stemware or china. 

The next feature that sets this model apart from others is its SmartThinQ technology. This allows you to control your dishwasher with your smartphone remote control app, meaning you can start or stop any cycle remotely from anywhere in your home! Additionally, the SmartThinQ runs diagnostics on its own so you can easily troubleshoot any issues without calling a technician or having to take apart the machine yourself. 

Finally, energy efficiency is another great feature of this model. The LG LDF5545ST Dishwasher meets Energy Star standards and uses only 9 gallons of water per cycle while still getting all dishes clean the first time around! It also has an adjustable upper rack which lets you adjust the height depending on what type of items need washing; this helps conserve energy by ensuring all items fit properly inside the machine for optimal performance each time it’s used. 

In conclusion, the LG LDF5545ST Dishwasher provides convenience and efficiency with its SmartThinQ technology, adjustable upper rack height settings, multiple wash cycles, huge capacity size (15 place settings), and energy efficient design (meets Energy Star standards).
