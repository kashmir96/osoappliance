There are also 4 temperature settings (high heat, medium heat, low heat and air-only) for greater customization based on the type of fabric being dried. The high spin speed helps reduce drying times while the end-of-cycle signal notifies you when your items are finished so you don’t have to keep checking back on them as they dry.

## Common faults for appliances like the Amana NED4655EW Dryer:
1. No Heat or Low Heat – The most common issue with Amana NED4655EW Dryers is that they are not producing enough heat to dry clothes properly.

2. Drum Doesn’t Spin – If the drum isn’t spinning, it could be due to a broken belt or clogged lint filter.

3. Unusual Noises – Unusual noises coming from the dryer could be caused by worn out parts such as a bearing, roller, or motor mount. 

4. Not Starting – This could be caused by a faulty door switch, timer control knob, thermal fuse, or cycling thermostat. 

5. Overheating – This is usually caused by clogged vents and filters which prevent proper air flow and cause the machine to overheat and shut down automatically for safety reasons
