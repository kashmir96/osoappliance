## Common faults for appliances like the Cuisinart Programmable Thermal Coffee Maker Coffee Machine:
1. Poor brewing – this is often caused by a build-up of coffee grounds and oils in the filter basket, which can result in weak, over-extracted coffee.

2. Inconsistent water temperature – this can be due to improper calibration of the heating element or faulty thermostat.

3. Leaking – this could be due to a faulty seal between the carafe and base or an issue with the pump system.

4. Clogged spray head – This occurs when coffee grounds block up the nozzle holes, making it difficult for water to pass through and resulting in poor extraction of flavor compounds from your coffee grounds. 

5. Malfunctioning timer/control panel– The timer may not accurately keep track of time or the control panel may fail to respond correctly when buttons are pressed, both leading to inconsistent results from your Cuisinart Programmable Thermal Coffee Maker Coffee Machine
