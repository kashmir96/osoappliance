## Enjoy Year-Round Swimming with the Right Heater
Swimming pools provide an inviting cool respite from the summer heat and an exciting hobby for people of all ages. But the cooler temperatures of spring and fall can make getting into the pool and enjoying it a less inviting prospect. Adding an electric pool heater to your above-ground or in-ground pool can make swimming possible year-round and turn your pool into a venue for family fun and relaxation throughout the year. 

When shopping for an electric pool heater, there are a few key things to consider. The size and shape of your pool and the type of electric heater you choose will influence the cost and efficiency of your heating system. Inground models are able to reach a higher temperature than their above-ground counterparts, and can reach the ideal temperature range in a matter of minutes. Conversely, an above-ground electric heater is better suited to smaller pools, and will require more time to reach the optimum temperature. 

Getting the right size electric pool heater is also important. Many electric heaters’ pool ratings are based on the surface area of the pool, so you’ll need to measure the size of your pool before making a purchasing decision. The size of the heater you need should be determined by the size of the surface area of the pool, but if you plan to use the pool for activities such as water aerobics or swimming laps, you may need a larger heater. 

Finally, you should also consider the placement of your electric pool heater. Most electric models require a hard surface such as concrete or asphalt for installation, so you’ll need to make sure you have the space in your backyard before purchasing a model. Above-ground models can be installed within a few feet of the pool, while inground models should be placed farther away. 

Whether you’re looking to take a dip in the pool during the winter or keep your pool warm in the summer, an electric pool heater can help you enjoy all the benefits of swimming no matter what the weather. By purchasing the right heater for your type of pool and area size, you can enjoy all the benefits of a comfortable and inviting swimming area throughout the year.
