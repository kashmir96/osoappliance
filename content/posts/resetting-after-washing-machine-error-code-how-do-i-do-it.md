## Resetting Your Washing Machine After an Error Code

When an error code appears on the washing machine's display, it can be confusing to know how to solve the issue. Resetting the machine is usually the first step in correcting the error. This can be as easy as resetting a circuit breaker or pressing a reset button. Read on to understand the steps you need to take to reset your washing machine after an error code occurs.

The first step is to identify the error code. Typically, the code will appear on the washing machine's display when something is wrong - be it a faulty part or a communication issue between the internal components. Once you identify the specific error code that has occurred, you can then look up the associated issue in the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). This will give you a better understanding of the issue and how it needs to be addressed.

After identifying the issue, you can then reset your washing machine following the steps outlined in the error code's glossary entry. This could involve performing a hard reset on the machine, which involves unplugging it and plugging it back in after 10 seconds, or it could involve pressing a reset button on the machine. Other resetting steps may involve turning off the water supply and checking the circuit breaker.

It is important to note that some washing machine models may require specific resetting steps to address error codes. If you are uncertain of how to reset your washing machine after identifying a code, it is highly recommended to contact an authorized appliance repair professional for assistance.

Resetting your washing machine after an error code has occurred is the first step in addressing an issue and restoring your machine to full working order. Once the reset is completed, you should refer to the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) again to ensure that the issue is fully resolved. If the error code reappears, contact an appliance repair professional to properly address the issue.
