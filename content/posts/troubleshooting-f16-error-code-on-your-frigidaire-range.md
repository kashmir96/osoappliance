## Diagnosing and Resolving Issues with F16 Error Code on Your Frigidaire Range
Cooking can be very enjoyable, but when your Frigidaire Range encounters an issue, it can easily ruin your plans. One common problem you may encounter is the F16 error code. Here's how to deal with it.

The F16 error code is a signal that indicates your oven is having trouble with its door latch. The door latch is a safety feature that ensures that your oven remains closed. It is important to note that the F16 error indicates a failure of the latch, not with the lock itself. 

F16 errors occur when the locking mechanism of the latch gets stuck. This means it cannot be released, which the error code is alerting the user to. In order to resolve this problem, you must first try to open the latch by using a flat-headed screwdriver. Simply slide the screwdriver under the latch and press up, opening the latch. If this method does not work, then it's possible that the latch itself has been damaged, and should be replaced.

It is important to note that in some cases, the problem may stem from an underlying issue, such as an electrical failure or an issue with the timing and temperature of the oven. If the latch is not stuck and the F16 error persists, then an experienced technician should be contacted to diagnose and solve the issue.
