## Avoid Washing Temptation: Understanding Laundry Care Labels
Every now and again, when the pile of laundry is overwhelming and hand-washing seems overwhelming, it's tempting to just throw everything into the washing machine. After all, the fabric care label reads "Machine Wash." But underestimating the requirements of some fabrics can mean the end of your favorite garment. To make sure that doesn't happen, it’s important to understand the meanings of different laundering symbols on the care label, particularly when it comes to machine-washing.

Laundry symbols – those mysterious codes — are actually quite easy decode and understand when it comes to the care instructions for the fabrics you’re washing. It can primarily tell you whether a garment is safe to machine wash or not. Typically, the care label shows an image of a tub filled with water with a hand or an “X” placed over it signifying if it can be machine washed or not.

If the care instructions have a “machine wash” symbol, it means you may machine wash the garment or fabric. Most likely, the fabric can be washed in water with a temperature range mentioned on the label, usually something like “warm,” “cold,” or “hot.” It’s best practice to follow these instructions, as it’s critical to the life of the garment. The washing symbol will also include one or two lines underneath the main tub symbol to indicate the maximum water temperature and gentle cycle use respectively.

However, there are some fabrics and materials that are more delicate and require more careful treatment in order to avoid being damaged. When these fabrics are present in a garment, you will be very likely to find on the care label a symbol of a hand instead of a washing machine, meaning the garment should not be machine-washed or dry-cleaned.

Entrusting the care of delicate garments and fabric to professionals is recommended for any piece of specialty clothing. A professional cleaning establishment can best restore delicate fabrics when showing signs of wear, minor damage, and signs of aging. Doing so will also maintain a rich color and extend the lifespan of the garment. 

If a care label displays the hand symbol, that means the fabric cannot be put into a machine and the garment should be either hand washed in a basin of water or dry-cleaned. If a garment has both symbols, that means the fabric may be machine washed or dry-cleaned, however, should you choose the latter option, the cleaning establishment must follow the same instructions as the care label since this type of fabric requires specific cleaning and care to maintain the name brand quality.

Understanding the various laundry care labels before you sort and wash your clothes is of critical importance. That's why it's essential to familiarize yourself with the laundry symbols and their meanings, as it can save you from a heap of hassle and potentially, money down the drain.
