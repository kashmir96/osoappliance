## Unclogging a Washer That Won't Drain

Have you ever had problems with your washer not draining correctly? If so, you may be wondering how to go about unclogging the offending appliance. Fortunately, there are a few reliable methods to help you unclog your washer so that it functions properly. 

The first step in unclogging your washer is to locate the drain hose. This is the part of the machine that releases water, and where any blockages might be causing the drain issue. Carefully remove the hose, making sure to keep your hands away from the sharp edges, and inspect it for any objects or build-up that could be obstructing the flow of water. If you find anything, make sure to remove it as it could be the cause of the clog.

Next, check the pump, where water is taken in and expelled. Make sure that it is securely connected and not blocked by dirt or debris. If the pump is blocked, try to clear out the area to ensure the proper flow of water. If the blockage is caused by a faulty pump, you may need to replace the part or call in a professional to help.

Finally, inspect the machine itself. Check the drain filter for objects or build-up that can interfere with the functionality of the washer. If the filter is blocked or clogged, try removing it and cleaning it to clear out any blockages. If this does not work, you may need to replace the part.

These methods should be able to help you unclog your washer, but if you can’t identify or fix the issue, it may be wise to call a professional. They will be able to assess and identify the problem quickly, allowing you to move forward with the unclogging process efficiently.
