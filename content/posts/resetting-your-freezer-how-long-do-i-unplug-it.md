## Resetting Your Freezer - Unplugging it for How Long?
Prior to resetting any kitchen appliance, it is important to unplug them for a time in order for the electronics to reset and for your appliance to safely reboot. To ensure your freezer is working again and free from potential errors or calibration, unplugging it is a necessary step in the reset process. This guide will go through the best way to do this and how long the appliance needs to be unplugged in order to complete the reset.

When looking to reset your freezer, it is important to begin by cleaning it out and discarding any freezer burn or expired food items. Once the appliance is mostly emptied out, it is time to unplug it. Freezers should stay unplugged for around five minutes, but this can be extended if needed in order to complete the reset. During this time the display panel will become inactive and the lights will go off. After the five minutes is up, it is safe to plug the freezer back in and it should now be in the reset mode.

If the reset has been successful then the LEDs or any other indicators should light and the freezer will start to cool down to its optimal temperature. If the reset is not successful, however, or the freezer isn't cooling, it is important to do a full troubleshoot through your model's error codes list. To help support users in this troubleshooting, we have put together an error codes guide to make this process simpler. 

Resetting your appliance is an important step in keeping it in optimal working order, and with the right steps, it can easily be done. By unplugging your freezer for five minutes and then plugging it in again it should fully reset. If any problems come up after this, our error codes guide is there to make the troubleshooting process easier.
