## Owning a Dishwasher Can Save You from Germs 
Are you looking for a health benefit of owning a dishwasher? Apart from convenience, they can also save you from germ-ridden dishes that can affect your health. In fact, dishwashers are much more hygienic than manual dishwashing. 

Studies have shown that when it comes to germ control, using a dishwasher is much more effective than hand washing. Manual washing is more likely to spread germs than remove them. With a dishwasher, dishes are super-heated with hot water and detergent which kills germs and bacteria. Dishes may also be sanitized with a heated rinse cycle which reaches temperatures high enough to kill most germs and bacteria. 

A dishwasher also provides peace of mind when it comes to hard to clean items like plasticware and nonstick pans. If a dish is not scrubbed properly, germs can survive and be transferred to other dishes. With a dishwasher, dirt and germs are washed away because of the very hot water and detergent used. 

Not only are dishwashers better for eliminating germs, but they are also more efficient and use less water than hand washing. This means that you’re conserving water while reducing your risk of making yourself or your family members ill from contaminated dishes. 

Many modern dishwashers come with sensors that measure the amount of soil and grime that has accumulated on dishes to adjust the wash cycle. This eliminates the need for pre-rinsing and saves you even more time and water. 

In summary, owning a dishwasher provides a surprising health benefit. Not only are they more effective at killing bacteria and germs than hand washing, but they are also more efficient. So, next time you’re washing dishes, consider investing in a dishwasher to keep your family healthy.
