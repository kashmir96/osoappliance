## Repurposing Your Broken Oven into Something Special
Do you have a broken oven in your home that doesn't function anymore? Don't be so quick to discard it - you can have a lot of fun repurposing the parts into an aesthetically pleasing collage!

Collage making has been popular for decades, offering creative individuals a way to express themselves. Increasingly, people are finding new uses for everyday objects to create art pieces in a variety of mediums. Why not use your broken oven to make a beautiful art collage?

The oven's broken pieces offer a myriad of colours, shapes and sizes, giving the artist a huge source of visual texture to work with. You can use these pieces to create either abstract images or something more representational - the choice is up to you. It's best to use a lightweight glue to secure the materials to a backing. Try using a thin foamcore or cardboard as a backing and use markers or paints to add even more colour and texture.

Creating a collage out of a broken oven is a great way to express yourself, have some fun and repurpose something you would have otherwise discarded. Best of all, your oven collage will be entirely unique to you, making it something you can cherish for years to come.
