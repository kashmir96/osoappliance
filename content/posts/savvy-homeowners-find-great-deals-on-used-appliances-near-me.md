## Score Sweet Deals on Pre-Owned Appliances Near You
If you're in the market for a new dishwasher, washing machine, microwave or other essential household appliances, you don't have to break the bank buying new. Savvy homeowners are increasingly turning to used appliances to find great deals on quality, reliable products. With a little searching, you can also find great deals on used appliances near you.

When combing through secondhand stores, classified ads and yard sales, it's important to inspect the appliance thoroughly before handing over any of your hard-earned cash. Start by ensuring the unit is in good physical condition, with no rust or physical damage. Then make sure it works — plug in the appliance and give it a whirl. Pay special attention to all electrical components such as the cord and plug. Make sure all safety mechanisms are functioning properly.

Another key factor in determining whether an appliance is worth its price tag is age. Check for a manufacturing date, usually printed on a small metallic label or a white sticker on the appliance, to help determine its age and how many years of working life it has left. This should also help you estimate how much use and how many repairs an appliance will require in the near future. 

Before you settle on a used appliance, compare prices between the different ones you find. An eager seller may offer you a hefty discount if you purchase more than one item. On the other hand, a reputable used appliance store may offer you a warranty such as a 30-day satisfaction guarantee to help protect your purchase.

When you’ve finalled zeroed in on the ideal appliance for your home, the next step is to find a trusted professional to install it. You can quickly locate an appliance technician in your region from our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians.
