## Scrap Metal & Fridges: An Ideal Match
Scrap metal is generally found in many items, from toys to car engines. Similarly, fridges and other household appliances like washers and dryers can contain scrap metal as well. Many people choose to sell scrap metal for extra earnings and to increase their sustainability. But does scrap metal actually make the perfect pair with fridges and other household appliances? Let’s take a closer look. 

Scrap metal from fridges and other items can be sold for top dollar. This is because scrap metal recyclers value the metal from fridges and other appliances, as they typically contain multiple types of metals, such as aluminum, copper, and stainless steel. Furthermore, all scrap metal has some cash value, regardless of what it’s made out of, so scrapping your old fridge can be a great way to earn extra money. 

When you’re dealing with scrap metal, make sure to always separate the different types of metal, as each type can bring a different price when you bring it to the recycler. This means that by properly separating the metals, you can optimize your earnings. Furthermore, make sure to wear protective gear when scrapping your old appliances, as some metals can be hazardous. 

Additionally, always make sure to responsibly dispose of your unwanted appliances. Many towns have municipal recycling centers where you can drop off old appliances and have them recycled. This is a great option to decrease your carbon footprint and to avoid placing additional strain on the local landfill. 

In conclusion, scrap metal and fridges do make the perfect pair. Not only can you earn extra money from scrapping your unwanted fridges, but you can also help decrease your carbon footprint by responsibly disposing of your old appliances.
