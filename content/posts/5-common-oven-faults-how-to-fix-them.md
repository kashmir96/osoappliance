## Common Oven Faults & Tips for Repair 

Ovens are a staple in almost every home in North America, providing tasty meals and snacks without having to worry about stove top disasters. If your oven has stopped functioning, it's not always necessary to call in a professional. There are many common oven faults and issues that a consumer can troubleshoot and fix on their own. Here are five common oven problems and tips on how to repair them.

### Problem 1: Oven Not Heating 

The first common oven fault that can occur is that the oven won’t heat. While this can be caused by an electrical issue, it can also be caused simply by an element or thermostat gone bad. If the element and thermostat appear to be functioning properly, you should carefully check all settings including the temperature settings and timer. If everything appears to be in working order and your oven still won’t heat, it might be time to call in an appliance repair technician.

### Problem 2: Oven Not Reaching Proper Temperature 

Sometimes, ovens will not heat up to the proper temperature, even though they seem to work just fine. This is most likely an issue with the thermostat. Make sure that the thermostat is correctly calibrated and if it is not, adjusting it can usually fix the issue. 

### Problem 3: Oven Not Igniting 

If your oven does not ignite, it can be caused by a blocked igniter or a faulty spark module. If the igniter is blocked, clean it with a damp cloth or brush to unclog it. If the igniter is still faulty, replace it. For a faulty spark module, check the spark gap and make sure it’s the correct size. If it’s not, replace the spark module and adjust the spark gap. 

### Problem 4: Smoke Coming Out of Oven 

If there is smoke coming out of your oven, the first thing to do is to make sure that the door is completely shut. If the oven door is not completely closed, it can cause smoke to come out, so make sure the door is shut tight. If your oven is still smoky, the flames may be too high and need to be adjusted. If this doesn’t work, there may be an issue with the igniter or spark module. 

### Problem 5: Oven Not Starting 

If your oven isn’t starting, it may be due to an issue with the wiring or the control board. Carefully inspect the control board for any signs of cracking or other damage. Replacing the control board should solve the issue. If the issue is with the wiring, consult an appliance repair technician. 

Knowing what to do if your oven stops working can save you a lot of time and money. Oftentimes, the most common oven faults can be fixed with simple troubleshooting, but if the issue persists or you are unsure how to proceed, consulting a professional appliance repair technician is the best option.
