## Getting the Most Out of your Electrical Energy Hair Dryer

Hair dryers are amazing devices, providing a convenient and effective way to dry and style our hair. But did you know that there is a right way versus a wrong way to use an electrical energy hair dryer? While this may sound like a no-brainer, it may surprise you how many people use their hair dryers incorrectly and then complain they are not getting the results they desire. Let’s look at the right way to use your electrical energy hair dryer.

The first step is to ensure that the power switch is turned off before plugging in the dryer. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for using the hair dryer as some variations exist. Make sure to adjust the speed, temperature, and airflow of the dryer to the appropriate setting, depending on the type and condition of your hair. Start drying your hair at the roots to get maximum benefit from the heat generated by the dryer. For best results, you should use a round brush in conjunction with the dryer as you work from the roots to the ends.

Once your hair is nearly dry, you can reduce the temperature. This will help you finish the drying process without over-heating the hair. Constantly move the dryer around, and when you are done, make sure you turn off the power switch before unplugging the dryer. Finally, ensure to clean and maintain your hair dryer following instructions in the manual.
