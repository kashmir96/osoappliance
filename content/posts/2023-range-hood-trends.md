As the kitchen is often the largest and most important room in a home, it’s no surprise that range hood trends have also been evolving year after year. With 2021 coming to an end, it’s time to start looking ahead and predicting what range hood trends will be popular in 2023. 

The first trend that is likely to continue into 2023 is the rise of stainless steel range hoods. Stainless steel has become a popular choice for those looking for an industrial-chic look, but also because it’s easy to clean and maintain. This material can also help create a modern look in any kitchen design. 

Another trend that we expect to see more of in 2023 are smart range hoods with integrated technology like Wi-Fi connectivity, voice control, touchscreens and LED lighting. Smart range hoods offer convenience features like remote access from your smartphone or tablet device as well as energy efficient settings for better air quality control. 

Range hood designs that incorporate sleek lines and minimalistic details are also likely to be popular in 2023 as more people focus on creating a streamlined aesthetic throughout their homes. Sleek lines make any space look larger while still providing necessary ventilation features without dominating the entire kitchen area too much with bulky hardware or detailing. 

With functionality being just as important as style when selecting a new range hood, there will be plenty of options available in 2023 designed with both form and function in mind such as convertible island mounted models or dual fuel compatible designs which allow you to use either gas or electric cooktops underneath them depending on your needs at any given time. 

Finally, decorative elements such as detailed backsplashes behind the stovetop area or additional decorative lighting above the cooking surface may become even more common additions during this next year thanks to their ability to add visual interest while providing increased safety benefits at the same time when installed correctly by an experienced professional team member . 

Overall ,2023 looks promising from a rangehood design standpoint with plenty of options available for homeowners wanting something stylish yet still practical enough for everyday use .
