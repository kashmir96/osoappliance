Stove for camping is a type of stove that is designed to be used outdoors while camping. It is typically portable, lightweight, and easy to set up. Stoves for camping can come in a variety of sizes, designs, and styles. They are available in both gas and liquid fuel models. Gas stoves are the most popular because they are easier to use and require less maintenance than the liquid fuel models.

Stoves for camping can be used to cook food over an open flame or on a hot plate. They are also great for boiling water, making coffee or tea, frying eggs, and heating cans of soup or stew. Depending on the model you choose, you may also be able to grill food directly on top of the stove. Some stoves even have multiple burners so you can cook several items at once! 

When choosing a stove for camping, it is important to consider your needs before buying one. Gas models offer convenience but they do require propane tanks which need to be refilled regularly; liquid fuel models require more preparation time but they tend to last longer and have higher BTU ratings (which means they heat quickly). Additionally, some stoves come with additional features like windscreens or simmer controls which can make cooking over an open flame easier in windy conditions. 

No matter what type of stove you choose for your next camping trip – gas or liquid fuel – having one will make cooking meals outdoors much easier! So don’t forget to bring along your stove when heading out into the wilderness!
