## Cleaning Stainless Steel: What Practices to Avoid

Cleaning stainless steel can be tricky. Shiny and slick stainless steel surfaces may require extra attention to clean, especially if you want to preserve their finish for a long time. Cleaning stainless steel requires avoiding certain practices. This post will discuss some cleaning practices to avoid when cleaning stainless steel. 

Do not use abrasives such as steel wool or scouring pads when cleaning stainless steel. These practices may scratch or damage the surface or finish, which can be hard to undo. Additionally, do not leave acidic or caustic substances such as bleach, hydrogen peroxide, oven cleaner or any other chemicals on the stainless steel surfaces for too long. Even though these cleaning agents can shift dirt, they can also cause corrosion and damage. 

Do not use a chlorine-base or bleach-base cleaning product as it may damage the stainless steel. They may damage the finish and cause discoloration. Do not use an ammonia-based product, as it can also leave a dull film on the surface of stainless steel. When cleaning the stainless steel, use a soft cloth and mild detergent in water. When working in the kitchen, it is best to avoid using highly alkaline detergents such as trisodium phosphate on stainless steel for general cleaning.

When it comes to cleaning stainless steel, paying attention to the products you use is key to preserving its finish.
