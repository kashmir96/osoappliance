## Reducing the Risk of Blender Injury: Keeping Kitchen Environments Safe

Making delicious food from the comfort of your own home is a treasured activity for many, but it's one that needs to be done with caution. Blender injuries are a real, preventable risk in kitchen environments. By understanding the common causes of blender-related injuries in the home, you can rest assured that you, your family, and your guests are safe in your space. 

The first step in reducing risk of injury is making sure you are using your blender properly. Many people assume that they know how to safely use a blender, but they may be unaware of the risks that come along with improper use. For example, some people leave their blender running while they change settings or try to move the container while in use - both of these activities could lead to serious injuries such as lacerations or burns. Read the user manual and be sure to follow all the manufacturer's instructions on proper use.

Another tip for avoiding blender-related injuries at home is to regularly inspect the kitchen space for any potential hazards. Inspections should include checking any electrical components of the blender and any applicable cords, making sure that all safety features are in place, and ensuring that all locks and buttons are functioning. Taking the time for routine inspections can help to prevent injuries by catching any mechanical or electrical breakdowns before you or your family members use the appliance.

Finally, understand the potential injuries that can result from blending. As mentioned before, lacerations and burns are common with improper use, but ingesting debris from a blender like loose screws or a piece of plastic can also be very dangerous. Take the time to closely inspect the machine before using it and do not hesitate to get help from a repair technician if you think that repairs are necessary.

Reducing the likelihood of blender-related injuries is important for any home chef. Following the advice in this post and viewing our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) should help to create a safer environment in your kitchen.

## Safeguarding From Blender Injuries: Essential Knowledge For Home Chefs

1. What are some practical ways to avoid blender injuries?
 - Unplug the blender from the wall before cleaning it or putting your hands inside to reach for debris.
 - Use the cover and lid provided with the blender each time you use it. 
 - Keep the speed set to low when adding ingredients during blending.
 - Never insert any metal objects or utensils into the blender.
 - Never leave the blender unattended while operating.

2. What can I do if I am cleaning a blender and metal objects are stuck inside?
 - If you believe that metal objects are stuck inside the blender, do not use the blender until the objects have been removed. To do this, unplug the blender and turn it upside down. Tap gently around the blades to loosen any stuck objects, then shake them out.

3. Should I ever put my hands inside the blender whilst it is switched on?
 - No. Under no circumstances should you ever put your hands inside of the blender whilst it is plugged in or switched on.

4. What should I do if I see sparks or smoke coming from my blender?
 - It is possible that the motor has sustained an overload or the blades have become obstructed. If this happens, unplug the blender and have it serviced by a qualified technician.

5. When should I service my blender to reduce the risk of injuries?
 - Blenders should be serviced at least once a year. Regularly check that all of the blades are in place and the plastic casing is undamaged. Pay special attention to the rubber base, which should fit snugly around the base of the motor. Replace the rubber base when it starts to deteriorate or break.
