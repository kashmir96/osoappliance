Vodka is a versatile spirit that can be mixed with many different ingredients to create delicious cocktails. Whether you’re in the mood for a light and refreshing spritzer or a creamy and indulgent martini, there’s sure to be a vodka mixer out there to suit your taste. But what are some of the most common mixers for vodka? Read on to learn more about the most popular mixers and appliances used to make them!

First up, tonic water is one of the most common mixers for vodka. Tonic water is carbonated, lightly sweetened, and has a distinctive bitter flavor due to the presence of quinine. When combined with vodka it creates an invigorating drink with some subtle sweetness. Tonic water can be served straight up in a tall glass over plenty of ice cubes or blended together in an electric blender with fresh fruit or juices for added flavor.

Another popular mixer for vodka is cranberry juice. Cranberry juice provides an unmistakable tartness that pairs perfectly with vodka’s smooth flavor profile. It also offers plenty of health benefits such as providing antioxidants, improving heart health, and boosting immunity. To make this classic cocktail simply combine equal parts cranberry juice and vodka over ice in a highball glass before topping it off with soda water or club soda if desired.

Finally, orange juice makes another great mixer for vodka as it adds both sweetness and acidity which play off each other nicely when mixed together in drinks like screwdrivers or mimosas. To make these delicious cocktails simply combine two parts orange juice with one part chilled vodka over plenty of ice before stirring gently until combined then garnish as desired! 

When making these classic cocktails at home there are several appliances you’ll need including shakers (for shaking up drinks), stirrers (for stirring delicate ingredients like citrus juices), muddlers (for muddling herbs or fruits), jiggers (for measuring out precise amounts of liquor) and strainers (for straining out chunks from your drink). With these basic tools you’ll have everything necessary to get creative behind the bar!
