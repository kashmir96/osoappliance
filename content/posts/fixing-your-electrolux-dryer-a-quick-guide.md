## Quick Tips to Troubleshoot Your Electrolux Dryer 

No one likes it when their dryer stops working and unfortunately this is something that a lot of us have to deal with. Electrical issues within the appliance can be hard to diagnose and even harder to repair. If you’re looking to save yourself headache and money, consider trying the tips below.

The first step is to clean the lint out of the lint filter on a regular basis. This will improve the efficiency of the dryer and reduce the risk of overheating. Be sure to check the exterior of the dryer to make sure all the vents are open and not clogged with lint as well. Cleaning the exterior vents once a year or as needed is recommended.

If the dryer is still not running correctly, there may be something wrong with the wiring in the appliance. If suspicious, turn off the power at the circuit breaker, unplug the dryer and inspect the wiring for loose connections or any visible issues. If you find something, read the manual for instructions on how to repair the problem.

: If there is no visible wiring issue, try checking the dryer drum for any obstructions. Removal of any additional laundry items from the dryer that might have become trapped in the drum is recommended. Smaller items can become stuck between the drum and wall of the dryer over time and limit the efficiency of the appliance.

If you’ve tried all of the above and your Electrolux dryer is still not functioning correctly, the next step should be to contact a professional service installation. Attempting to repair an electrical appliance on your own, if you do not have the correct wiring credentials, can be dangerous. Search our [directory of professional appliance repair technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to find the help you need. 

Troubleshooting your Electrolux dryer can be incredibly frustrating, but following these steps carefully can help you diagnose and address the issue quickly. Remember to check for common problems such as clogged vents and loose wiring first before calling a professional for further assistance.
