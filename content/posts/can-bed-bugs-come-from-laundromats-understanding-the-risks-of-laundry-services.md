## Can Bed Bugs Come from Laundromats?: Understanding the Risks of Laundry Services
 
We’ve all been there—you’re in a hurry and you don’t have time to do your laundry at home, so you drop it off at the local laundromat. You get your clean clothes back and head home, but could you be bringing something else back with you? Could bed bugs come from laundromats?

Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Bed bugs can come from laundromats if someone uses an infested washer or dryer. The heat of the machines creates an ideal environment for bed bug eggs to hatch, and then those same machines will spread them to whatever is inside them when they are done.

The good news is that bed bugs are not likely to be found in a well-maintained laundromat. The combination of hot water and detergents used in most wash cycles should kill any existing eggs or larvae that may be present on clothing items brought into the facility. Regular cleaning of washers and dryers can also limit the possibility of infestation since these areas are often prime hiding spots for bed bugs due to their warmth and dark crevices they can hide inside. 

To protect yourself when using a public laundry facility, always check machines before using them for any signs of possible infestation (such as live bugs or black spots on interior surfaces). If possible, bring your own detergent or soap with you rather than relying on what may already be in place at the facility as this could reduce potential contamination risk from other patrons who may have recently used an infected machine without knowing it. It's also a good idea to inspect your clothing once it comes out of any machine for signs such as small red bites or fecal matter left behind by bedbugs which could indicate an active infestation within that particular unit before leaving with your newly cleaned garments in hand! 

Taking precautions like these can help keep you safe from bringing home unwanted guests along with your freshly washed clothes back home after visiting a public laundry facility - but it still pays to be aware and diligent about checking machines before use just in case something has been missed by staff during their regular maintenance duties! Moreover, should these pests make their way into our homes regardless – appliance repairs may become necessary due to damage caused by these invaders; luckily [our directory of appliance repair technicians here](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) has got us covered no matter what kind of repair we need!
