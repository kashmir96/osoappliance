A food dehydrator is a great investment for anyone who wants to preserve their food for longer. It’s an effective way to preserve fruits, vegetables, and herbs and can even be used to make jerky and other snacks. But how much electricity does a dehydrator use? The answer depends on the size of the unit and the wattage of its heating element.

To determine how many amps your dehydrator uses, first you need to know its wattage rating. Most dehydrators range from 500 watts up to 1,500 watts, with larger models consuming more power than smaller ones. Once you have the wattage rating, you can calculate the amperage by dividing it by 120 volts (the standard voltage in US households). For example: A 750-watt dehydrator would use 750/120 = 6.25 amps of power while running. 

It’s important to note that most household circuits are only rated for 15 amps, so if your dehydrator draws more than that it may trip the circuit breaker or cause an electrical overload. To be safe, it’s best to plug your dehydrator into a dedicated outlet or one that is not being used by any other appliances at the same time. 

In general, expect your food dehydrator to use between 4–8 amps depending on its size and wattage rating—so make sure you don't overload any circuits in your home when using it!
