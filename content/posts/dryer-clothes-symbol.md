The dryer clothes symbol is a symbol that can be found on clothing labels, indicating whether or not a particular garment should be put in the dryer. This symbol is usually represented by a square with a circle in the middle and a line running through the middle of the circle. The line indicates whether the garment should be dried on a low, medium, or high heat setting.

The dryer clothes symbol is important to pay attention to when laundering your clothes. If the garment is not labeled with the symbol, it should not be put in the dryer. Putting a garment in the dryer that is not meant to be dried can cause it to shrink, fade, or even become damaged. Additionally, some fabrics, such as wool, should never be put in the dryer as it can cause them to shrink or become misshapen.

It is also important to pay attention to the line within the dryer clothes symbol. The line indicates the heat setting that should be used for drying the garment. If the line is horizontal, the garment should be dried on a low heat setting. A line that is slightly angled indicates that the garment should be dried on a medium heat setting. Lastly, a line that is angled more steeply indicates that the garment should be dried on a high heat setting.

By following the dryer clothes symbol, you can ensure that your clothes will last longer and maintain their shape and color. Paying attention to the symbol can also help you save time and energy, as you wonâ€™t have to worry about constantly checking the garment for signs of damage or shrinkage.
