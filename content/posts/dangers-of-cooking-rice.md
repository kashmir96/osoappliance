Cooking rice may seem like a simple and easy task, but there are serious risks associated with it. Rice is a staple food for many people around the world, and so proper handling and cooking of it is important for health and safety. Here are some of the potential dangers associated with cooking rice:

1. Food Poisoning: Uncooked or undercooked rice can contain harmful bacteria, like Bacillus cereus, which can cause food poisoning if ingested. Properly cooked rice should reach an internal temperature of at least 165°F to kill any harmful bacteria that may be present. 

2. Cross Contamination: When preparing rice, it's important to avoid cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods by using separate cutting boards and utensils for each. Failure to do so can result in dangerous bacteria being spread from one food to another, leading to potential illness or even death in some cases. 

3. Allergies: Cooked or uncooked rice can also cause allergic reactions in some people depending on their sensitivity level. People who have a known allergy should avoid consuming uncooked rice as well as any products that contain uncooked rice as an ingredient (e.g., sushi). 

4. Choking Hazard: If large pieces of cooked or uncooked grains are consumed without being properly chewed, they can pose a choking hazard for both children and adults alike due to their size and shape which makes them difficult to swallow whole without blocking the airway passage leading into the lungs. 

In conclusion, while cooking rice may seem like an innocuous task, there are certain risks involved if not done correctly that could have serious consequences on one’s health or even lead to fatality in extreme cases if not properly handled or cooked correctly before eating it! Therefore it is important that proper precautions are taken when handling this staple food item in order ensure its safe consumption by everyone who enjoys it!
