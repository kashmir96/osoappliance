The dimensions of washing machines in New Zealand vary depending on the type and make of the machine. Front-loaders tend to be larger than top-loaders, and energy efficient models tend to be slightly larger than non-energy efficient models. 

For front-loaders, the most common dimensions are 850mm height x 600mm width x 600mm depth. The capacity for these machines is typically between 6kg – 8kg, or around 15 – 20 towels per load. 

Top-loaders are generally smaller in size than front-loaders, with most common dimensions being 840mm height x 600mm width x 535mm depth. The capacity for these machines is typically between 4kg – 6kg, or around 10 – 15 towels per load. 

When it comes to buying a washing machine in New Zealand there are a range of factors that need to be considered such as the size of your household and laundry space available, as well as your budget. It’s important to measure the area where you plan to place your new machine so you can determine which size will best suit your needs.
