## Fixing the E4 Error on Your Washing Machine 

Are you getting an error code E4 on your washing machine? Many household appliances end up displaying error codes, and it can be very frustrating, requiring technical expertise and time to solve the issue. Fortunately, the steps to fix an E4 error on your washing machine are straightforward.

The E4 error code is most commonly found on Samsung washing machines, when the washing machines main board is having difficulty communicating with the main motor. This typically results in the washing machine not spinning, draining, agitating, or displaying the error code itself on the digital readout. 

To fix the E4 error code on your washing machine, there are two steps you must take:

1. Unplug the washing machine from the power and water supplies, then leave it to sit for 15 minutes. This resets the appliance and gives it a chance to boot up properly.

2. Re-plug the washing machine and allow the machine to cycle through to its full cycle before trying the wash again.

In the event that the E4 error code keeps appearing or your washing machine is still unable to operate properly, you may have to contact a professional appliance repair technician.

Following these steps and taking the appropriate action when error codes are displayed can solve most common issues related to household appliances. In case you find yourself unable to determine the cause of an issue by code, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) may be able to help. Good luck!
