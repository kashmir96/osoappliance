## Troubleshooting Your Folgers Liquid Coffee Machine
If you're the proud owner of a Folgers Liquid Coffee Machine, you know what a remarkable convenience they offer. You can immediately enjoy freshly brewed, rich coffee within minutes of pushing a button – no measuring, grinding, or waiting involved. Unfortunately, sometimes, your Liquid Coffee Machine can break down. To diagnose and fix the issue, understanding the meaning of error codes is essential.

Error codes are supposed to give you a helpful glimpse into what’s causing your machine to malfunction. What do the codes mean, and what should you do about it?

Most error codes tell you the actual condition that’s causing the problem, and sometimes, they’ll even point you towards a solution. In some cases, all you need to do is wait, while in other circumstances, it may be necessary to replace a faulty part. If the code you’re seeing is something you don’t understand, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) can be a helpful resource. From there, you’ll have a better idea of what’s going on and what you may need to do about it.

At times, the issue might just be a simple reset. Most Folgers Liquid Coffee Machines have a simple reset button which will allow you to get it back up and running at full strength. If the reset button won’t quite do the trick, there is a troubleshooting sheet nearby with the machine. It will help you get it fixed quickly and easily.

If none of these solutions are successful and the error code you’re seeing just won’t go away, it’s time to call in a professional. That same troubleshooting sheet you received with your machine should provide you with a phone number, along with other contact options, so you know exactly who to call.

Making sure your machine is in a functioning state is essential, particularly if you use it on a regular basis. Understanding how to troubleshoot it, and how to interpret error codes is just as important. To help you out, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) offers further expertise to understand what your Liquid Coffee Machine is telling you and what steps need to be taken.
