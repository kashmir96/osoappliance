## Resetting a Whirlpool Duet Washer

Keeping your Whirlpool Duet washer running at its peak performance requires occasional maintenance and know-how. Knowing how to reset the error codes displayed by your Whirlpool Duet washer is an important skill to have. Here we will outline the steps you need to take to reset your washer and keep it running smoothly. 

The first step to reset your Whirlpool Duet washer is to unplug it from the power source. This will ensure that the machine is not in active use when you reset it. Wait for about 30 seconds for the machine to reset before plugging it back in. 

Now that your machine is powered off, you can begin resetting the error codes. Generally, each manufacturer has their own codes and method for resetting them. For Whirlpool Duet washers, the most commonly used code is Fh. To reset this code, press and hold the “delay start” and “extra rinse” buttons at the same time for three seconds. The error code should then be reset. 

If this does not work, you can try resetting the washer by unplugging it for about 30 seconds and then plugging it back in. This will reset any error codes that may be stuck on the washer. If neither of these methods work, you may want to consult the user’s manual for more detailed instructions on resetting error codes.
