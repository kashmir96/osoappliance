## Unlock Your Dehydrator's Potential with the Right Accessories

If you’ve recently invested in a dehydrator, you already know the many benefits of owning and learning to use one. Dehydrators are great sustainable tools for preserving fruits, vegetables and even herbs. There’s also the potential to experiment and make creative dishes, like dried fruit chips and crackers. But did you know that you can really unlock the full capabilities of your dehydrator by investing in a few key accessories? 

The first accessory that is essential for any dehydrator owner is some type of trays or liners. Without these, liquids or melted items could drip into the heating element causing damage or mess. Trays and liners also can increase your dehydrator’s efficiency by not having food directly on the heating surface which can speed up drying time, and also help to spread your items out more evenly. 

Another great accessory is a thermostat plug. This helps to regulate temperature of the dehydrator, ensuring that it isn’t too hot or too cold, allowing you to dehydrate more efficiently. And if you plan on dehydrating a lot of items, you might think of investing in another drying chamber. This will allow you to double your drying capacity in the same amount of time, making it a great accessory for those looking to make full use of their dehydrator. 

Finally, don't forget to pick up an instruction manual. Many people forget to pick up this important accessory when they initially purchase their dehydrator. Instruction manuals are great reference guides to not only learn the capabilities of your dehydrator, but also providing safety and storage tips when using your dehydrator. 

By investing in a few key accessories for your dehydrator, you can really maximize the use and flexibility of the appliance. Having the right accessories ensure that the process for dehydrating your items is safe and efficient, and you’ll be able to get the most out of your dehydrator.
