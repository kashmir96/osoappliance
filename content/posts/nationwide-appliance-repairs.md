Are you in the market for an appliance repair service? If so, you may be wondering whether to go with a large nationwide provider or an independent one. While it may seem more convenient or safer to choose a big name, there are actually several reasons why independent service providers might be better and cheaper when it comes to appliance repairs.

First and foremost, hiring an independent service provider can save you money. Nationwide companies often charge higher rates for their services due to their expenses associated with running a larger business. Furthermore, independents typically don’t have franchise fees or other additional costs that national companies do; further reducing the price of your repair job. 

Another benefit of going with an independent is that they are often more experienced and knowledgeable than technicians from the bigger names. Because independents usually own smaller businesses, they have time to perform extensive training on all types of appliances and brands. Also, because they don’t have access to as many resources as a big company would, they’re typically more motivated to give you personalized customer service since their success depends on your satisfaction. 

Finally, it’s important to consider convenience when choosing who should fix your appliance. With a larger provider like Sears or Best Buy, availability can become an issue as they often only offer appointments during limited hours throughout the week leaving customers waiting days for help if something goes wrong on Saturday night. On the other hand, independents usually offer evening and weekend hours making them much more accessible when you need help fast! 

In conclusion there are numerous advantages of using an independent appliance repair service provider over one of the nation-wide chains; chief among them being cost savings and convenience in scheduling appointments around your lifestyle
