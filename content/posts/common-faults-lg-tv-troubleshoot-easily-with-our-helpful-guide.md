## Troubleshoot LG TV Issues Easily with Our Guide 
Are you experiencing a common fault on your LG TV? Don’t worry, you’ve come to the right place! Our helpful guide below will walk you through the troubleshooting process and enable you to quickly and easily identify and fix the issue. 

One common issue when it comes to LG TVs is a blank screen. This can be caused by a range of factors and should be addressed in the following order: 

1. Check the power connection is secure – sometimes a minor jolt or the plug coming loose from a socket could be the cause. 
2. Monitor the LED activity – this can help you to identify if the TV is still getting power. On an LG TV, a white LED light next to the Power button usually indicates it is receiving power. 
3. Re-plug the cables – disconnect the HDMI/AV cables from the TV and plug back in. 
4. Test the TV using a different source – if applicable try plugging a different device into your HDMI ports and see if it works. 

If the issue persists it could be that you’re experiencing either a hardware or firmware issue. In this case, you may want to consider taking your LG TV to a professional repair technician. It’s important to find a credible technician to ensure a proper and safe repair process.
