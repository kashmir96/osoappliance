If you’re new to using an electric blender, it can seem intimidating. But, with a few simple steps, you’ll be blending like a pro in no time! 

First and foremost, make sure your blender is plugged in and turned on. Then, assemble the base of the blender by attaching the jar to the motor. Depending on your model of blender, this could involve twisting or pushing the jar into place. Once that is done securely, there should be some type of locking mechanism that will ensure the jar remains firmly attached to the motor during use. 

Now it’s time to add your ingredients! Generally speaking, liquids should go in first followed by softer items (like fruits) and then hard items (like ice). If you are making a smoothie with frozen fruits or ice cubes make sure to add them slowly while running at low speed so as not to overwhelm your appliance. When adding ingredients one-by-one make sure not to fill it more than two thirds full as hot air needs room to escape during blending process. 

Once all necessary ingredients are added it is time for actual blending process! Depending on what type of recipe you are making there might be several speed settings available but usually slowest setting can be used for most recipes except when crushing ice cubes where higher speeds are needed. After desired consistency is reached stop blending and check if all ingredients have been blended properly or not before pouring drink into glasses or other containers. 

And lastly don’t forget about cleaning up afterwards! Most blenders come with special cleaning tools that allow easy access even for tight spots around blade holder so food residue won't remain stuck after washing process has been completed. Also always unplug machine before washing so there won't be any risk of electric shock while cleaning up appliance itself or parts attached such as power cord etc.. 

Using an electric blender isn’t complicated once you get used to it; following these steps will help ensure that each blend turns out perfect every time!
