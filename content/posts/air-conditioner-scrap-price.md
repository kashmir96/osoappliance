Air conditioners are essential for staying comfortable in the summer months, but when it comes time to replace them, you may be wondering what you can do with your old unit. One option is to scrap it for cash.

Scrapping an air conditioner usually involves taking it apart and selling off the individual components. Prices vary depending on the size and model of the unit, as well as the current market prices for scrap metal. Typically, you can get around $25-$50 per ton of scrap metal from an air conditioner.

The most valuable parts of an air conditioner are usually its copper tubing, aluminum fins and other metal components like brass valves and steel screws. The compressor motor is also valuable since it contains copper windings that can be recycled into other products. Other parts such as plastic casings, rubber hoses and wiring may also be worth something if they are in good condition.

Once you have all of your parts separated out, you will need to take them to a local scrap yard or recycling center to be weighed and priced accordingly. Most places will pay by cash or check on site, but some may require payment via PayPal or direct deposit into your bank account. Be sure to ask about payment methods before bringing in your materials so there are no surprises when you arrive!

Scrapping an old air conditioner is a great way to earn some extra money while also doing something good for the environment by recycling materials that would otherwise end up in landfills or oceans. With the right approach and a bit of research into current market prices, you could make up to $50 per ton from scrapping your old AC unit!
