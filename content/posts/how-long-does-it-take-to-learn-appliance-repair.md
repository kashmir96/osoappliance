Appliance repair is a skill that can be acquired through research, practice and education. As with any other job-related skill, the amount of time it takes to learn how to repair appliances depends on the individual's commitment to learning and the complexity of repairs needed. 

If you are just looking to do basic repairs, such as replacing a heating element in an electric stove or a light bulb in a microwave oven, then it shouldn't take too long to learn. You will need some basic knowledge of electricity and wiring, as well as access to the right tools and parts. With research and practice, you should be able to complete simple repairs within a few days or weeks. 

If you are looking to become an experienced appliance repair technician, then it will likely take much longer. Depending on what type of appliances you want to work on (refrigerators, dishwashers, washers/dryers etc.), there can be considerable complexity in how they operate and how they should be repaired. In order to gain proficiency at repairing appliances, one must have extensive knowledge about their electrical systems and components as well as hands-on experience in disassembling them for diagnosis and repair. This could take several months or even years of apprenticeship under professional technicians before one can consider themselves an experienced appliance repair technician. 

In addition to gaining experience working on actual appliances, there are other resources available that can help you become proficient at appliance repair faster than going through an apprenticeship program alone. You could take online classes or attend classes at trade schools dedicated solely towards teaching appliance repair techniques. Additionally, books written by industry veterans offering insight into how different types of appliances work can provide useful knowledge for aspiring technicians who want to start repairing quickly without having prior experience with specific brands/models/types of appliances. 

In conclusion, the amount of time required for becoming proficient at appliance repair varies depending on what level you are aiming for (basic versus professional). Basic repairs can usually be learned within days or weeks whereas true mastery requires months or even years of apprenticeship under professional technicians along with taking courses from dedicated schools or reading up from books written by industry veterans .
