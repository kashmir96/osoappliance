Regular cleaning of the washing machine is an important part of maintaining your machine and keeping it running efficiently. The cleaning cycle is a great way to remove mold and mildew, as well as other dirt, grime and residue that can accumulate in the interior of your machine over time. Here’s what you need to know about performing a washing machine cleaning cycle. 

First, start by removing any laundry from the washer before beginning the cleaning cycle. Next, fill the washer with hot water up to its highest level setting. You may want to add some bleach or white vinegar for extra effectiveness against mold and mildew buildup. 

Once you’ve filled the washer with hot water, select a gentle wash cycle at a high temperature setting—the hottest setting available on your machine will work best for this task. Let the cycle run until it has finished completely before moving onto step number three. 

Once finished, drain all of the hot water from your washer by pressing down on the start/stop button until it has emptied completely into your sink or floor drain (depending on which one is connected). Once empty, fill up again with hot water but this time add 1 cup of baking soda per gallon of water used – this helps remove any odors that may have developed during regular use. Run another complete wash cycle at high heat setting just like before and let it finish completely again before proceeding further. 

Once finished with both cycles, let all of the remaining water empty into your sink or floor drain again and then wipe down any visible areas inside your washing machine with warm soapy water using a soft cloth or sponge – paying special attention to any areas where lint or dirt can accumulate such as around seals and door hinges where moisture is more likely to build up over time leading to mold growth if left unchecked! Finally dry off all surfaces once complete so there’s no chance for bacteria or mold spores lingering after completing this process! 

Cleaning out your washing machine regularly can help extend its life while also keeping it free from bad smells caused by mildew buildup which oftentimes occurs in humid climates if left unchecked! It may seem like a chore but following these steps each month will help keep things running smoothly in no time!
