## Fixing a Broken Oven Knob So Your Meal Isn't Spoiled
Meal planning can be hard enough. Nobody wants their cooking plans to be spoiled by a broken oven knob. Fortunately, this homegrown disaster doesn't have to disrupt the meal. Here’s how you can fix the issue yourself for quick mealtime solutions. 

The first step is to determine whether the knob is actually broken or just disconnected. If it has become disconnected, reattaching the knob should fix the problem. If this isn’t the case and the knob cannot be reconnected, then it will have to be replaced. You’ll need a replacement knob that fits your oven’s make. 

Once you have the replacement, line up the shaft of the new knob and the oven knob holder. Make sure the knob is facing the right direction and then secure in place with a set screw. If your oven doesn’t have a set screw, then try lining it up and pushing down hard into the holder before twisting the knob until you hear a click. This should secure it in place.

Sometimes, cleaning the knob and its holder can help if it has suffered from flyway food and grease. Wipe away any residue with a cloth before you attempt to reinstall the knob. 

When it comes to quick fixes, understanding exactly what is wrong and the type of appliance you have is key. If you’re not confident and still have questions, don’t attempt to fix it yourself.
