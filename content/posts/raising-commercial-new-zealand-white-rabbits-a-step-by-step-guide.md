Owning your own pet rabbit can bring a great deal of joy and pleasure, but it can also be a rewarding business venture. This step-by-step guide will provide the knowledge and tools needed to raise New Zealand White Rabbits on a commercial level. 

First, you need to find a reputable source for purchasing your New Zealand White Rabbits. There are several online vendors, as well as more local brokers and dealers. Once you have the rabbits delivered, you need to make sure that an area for housing the rabbit has been prepared. Rabbit hutches should be a minimum of four feet by two feet in size, with open air and plenty of space to hop around. 

It is important to have an appropriate diet for the rabbits, as this will heavily influence their health and weight. A good diet should consist of hay, fresh vegetables, and pellets specially formulated for rabbits. Water should always be available. The rabbits should be weighed regularly to track their growth, and should be groomed often in order to keep their fur healthy.

Finally, the rabbit needs to be neutered or spayed. This will keep the population growth in check and prevent in-breeding. Furthermore, the rabbits need to be examined and vaccinated on a regular basis in order to keep them healthy and happy! 

Raising commercially viable New Zealand White Rabbits can be an incredibly rewarding experience - both for the rabbits and for the owner. Knowing the right techniques and having an appropriate environment is essential to the success of the venture.
