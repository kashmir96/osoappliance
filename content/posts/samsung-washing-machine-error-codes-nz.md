# Samsung washing machine error codes nz

Are you getting error codes while trying to use your Samsung washing machine? Don’t worry, you are not alone. Over the years, many people have encountered errors while using Samsung washing machines. To help you out, here is a blog explaining some of the common error codes for Samsung washing machines in New Zealand. 

The first and most common error code is SE or “SAMSUNG EASY-SET ERROR” code. This code indicates that there is an issue with the washer settings, such as the water level setting or temperature setting. To resolve this problem, ensure that all settings are correct and then try running your cycle again. 

The second error code is DC or “DRAIN CONNECTION ERROR” code. This indicates that there is a problem with the drain connection or hose leading from your washer to the drainage point. The most common cause of this issue is clogging in either the drain connection hose or drainage point itself. To resolve this issue, try unclogging any blockage and make sure both ends of your drain hose are securely connected before running another cycle on your washer. 

The third error code to be aware of is IE or “INLET ERROR” code. This usually indicates a problem with the water supply to your washer, such as low pressure from either a mains tap connection or plumbing pipes connected to it. It could also mean that there is an obstruction within these pipes which restricts water from coming into your washer correctly and efficiently during a cycle run time period. Resolve this issue by checking all water sources connected to your washer and ensuring they are free of any blockages before restarting another cycle on it again. 

Finally, we have LE or “LEAK ERROR CODE” which typically occurs due to excessive amounts of soap suds accumulating inside the drum during washing cycles and spilling over onto other components in their vicinity such as a control panel etc..This can be fixed by reducing laundry detergent usage when running washing cycles on your device and making sure not to overload it with too many clothes at one time as well!
