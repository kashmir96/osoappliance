## Can Overloading a Dryer Put You at Risk of Fire?
Using your dryer is a necessity for most households, but it is important to be aware of the danger of overloading your appliance so you don’t put your home at risk of a fire. Many people, especially busy households with lots of laundry to do, are tempted to overload their dryer so all the clothes can be done at once. But there is more to it than just getting from Point A to Point B, and understanding the dangers associated with overloading your dryer can help you keep your home and your family safe.

Dryers work by running heated air through the clothes to dry them. While the air runs through the clothes, it causes them to move around the dryer drum. When your dryer is overloaded, there won’t be enough room for the clothes to move around and the heat will become trapped inside. This trapped heat can cause the clothes to heat up and accumulate static electricity, which in turn can cause a spark and result in a fire.

It can be tempting to just pile lots of clothes in the dryer to save time, but the risks are simply not worth it. Not only does an overloaded dryer take much longer to get the clothes dry, it also puts your home and your family at risk. It’s always better to take the extra time to make sure your dryer is not overloaded than to be faced with an untold disaster.

It’s also important to make sure your dryer is well ventilated. If your dryer is not properly ventilated, then it leaves your home vulnerable to a fire as the trapped heat can buildup and spark a fire. An easy way to tell if your dryer is not ventilated properly is if the clothes take a long time to dry, the temperature outside of your dryer is hot, or you see smoke or smell a burning odor coming from the appliance.

There are some basic steps you can take to ensure your dryer is running as safely as possible. Before you put your clothes in, make sure to sort them by type and size. This ensures they dry at the same rate. Also, be sure to clear any lint or debris from the lint trap before or after each use. This helps maintain air flow and can prevent fires. Lastly, be sure to pay attention to the signs that your dryer might be overloaded or needs to be repaired, and have it serviced as soon as possible.

Making sure your dryer is running correctly and using it safely is the best way to prevent a fire from occurring. Check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to find the best dryer for your home.
