## Is My Fridge Not Cooling?

If your food isn't staying as cool as it should be, there might be an issue with your fridge not cooling properly. Troubleshooting your appliance can seem like a daunting task, but with a few tips, you can get your fridge running again. 

The first step to troubleshooting your fridge is to identify the potential cause for why your fridge might not be cooling. Check to see whether your fridge is plugged into a working outlet, and make sure that no circuit breakers have been tripped. Also check for any mistakingly turned-off switches or thermostats. If any of these issues have been resolved and the appliance is still not performing properly, it is time to move onto the next step. 

Perform a manual defrost cycle. If your fridge has a manual defrost cycle, it's best to run the cycle to reset the appliance. To do this, you will need to unplug the fridge, turn it off, and leave it unplugged for an hour. After the hour passes, plug the fridge back in and turn it on. Your fridge will return to the normal temperature after a few hours of operation. 

If the manual defrost cycle did not help, you will most likely need to call a professional to help troubleshoot the issue. A technician can inspect your fridge and repair any parts that may be worn or malfunctioning. A technician can also let you know if any part needs to be replaced and can provide you with instructions on how to correctly operate your fridge. 

Having a functioning fridge is paramount for preserving food and keeping it at the proper temperature. If your appliance is not cooling, it is best to troubleshoot the appliance and turn to a professional when necessary.
