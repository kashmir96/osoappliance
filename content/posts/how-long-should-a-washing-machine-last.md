# How long should a washing machine last

If you are in the market for a new washing machine, you may be wondering how long it will last. The answer depends on a variety of factors, including the quality of the appliance, how often it is used and how well it is maintained.

In general, a high-quality washing machine should last between 8 and 12 years. Of course, this can vary significantly depending on usage and maintenance. If you only do light loads of laundry and always use the correct settings for each type of fabric, your washing machine will likely last longer than that. Similarly, if you regularly maintain your washer by cleaning out lint traps and hoses and inspecting drain pumps regularly, this can help prolong its lifespan as well.

On the other hand, if you frequently overload your washer with too many clothes or challenge its durability by using incorrect settings for certain types of fabrics or wash cycles that are too harsh on fabrics like hard-to-wash items like sheets or jeans – all these actions can reduce the lifespan of your washing machine drastically over time. Additionally, not performing regular maintenance will also take its toll on your appliance over time; neglecting to check filters or failing to remove mineral buildup from water deposits can cause breakdowns more quickly than usual. 

At the end of the day, buying a good quality washer from a reputable brand is essential if you want it to last longer than 8 to 12 years; investing in an energy efficient model may also save money in electricity costs down the line as well as prolong its life expectancy. However there’s no guarantee when it comes to buying an appliance; taking proper care and maintenance into consideration can add more longevity to any washer model out there in today’s market!
