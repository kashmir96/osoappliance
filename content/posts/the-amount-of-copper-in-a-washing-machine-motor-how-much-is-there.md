## How Much Copper Is Found in a Washing Machine Motor?
When it comes to understanding the components of a washing machine, many of us don't look any further than what is visible and exposed. A major component in any washing machine is its motor and most people don't think much more than that. However, did you know that the motor of a washing machine is comprised largely of copper wiring? Let's learn why copper is so vital to a washing machine motor and how much of it is there. 

Copper is a lightweight and strong metal that is optimal for use in an electric motor due to its high conductivity properties. This means that electricity can be passed through copper wires quickly and at less of a cost since there is no need for heavy-duty insulations. This is why most washing machine motors are made up of a network of copper wiring and it is also why metal recycling centers are always interested in old motors, as they have a decent amount of copper in them. 

In general, a washing machine motor contains anywhere from 30 to 40 metres of copper wiring. This wiring is inside the motor itself and typically winds around a rotor and stator. The total amount of copper in an individual motor will depend on the size and capacity of the washing machine, but it is usually a significant amount. 

It is important to properly dispose of any washing machines that may no longer be in use. Not only do metal recycling centers benefit from the copper and other metals, but it is also better for the environment as well. Keeping this copper out of landfills is beneficial, as copper can begin to leech into the local water supplies and contaminate them, leading to serious health issues.
