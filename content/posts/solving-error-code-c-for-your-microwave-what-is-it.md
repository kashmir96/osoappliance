## Solving the Error Code C on Your Microwave

Having errors on your appliances can be a headache, but fear not! Error Code C on your microwave is not complicated to solve. Let's explore what causes this error code, how to identify it and—most importantly—how to fix it.

Error code C generally appears when your microwave experiences a voltage problem. This means that the microwave is not detecting the right amount of power being supplied to the appliance. Most microwave models use the Error Code C to indicate that the voltage is low—less than 110 volts—which can be caused by a loose connection on the power cord and wall outlet. If you take a look at the inside of the microwave and you see the message 'err c' (in some cases, it may appear as 'Er' with a flashing number '4'), then it means the power cable isn't connected properly, or the connected outlet isn't providing enough power to run the microwave.

To fix this, first start by checking to make sure the power cable is firmly plugged in at the wall and into the back of the microwave. Make sure that the wall outlet is securely providing enough power, and if the error code persists, you may need to run the microwave using an extension cord that plugs into a separate wall outlet to determine the source of the error code.

If the error code reappeared with the expansion of cord, then you will likely need a professional appliance repair person to diagnose and repair the issue. This is important as the problem could be more serious, such as a faulty power cord, or a bad fuse or temperature sensor that needs to be replaced.

In short, Error Code C indicates a voltage issue in your microwave. Start by taking a look at the power cable and wall outlet to make sure they are working correctly, and if they appear okay, then it might be time to call in an experienced appliance repairperson to take a look.

With all these tips, you should now be able to solve the pesky Error Code C on your microwave. If you are looking for great appliances for your home and need resources, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) today!
