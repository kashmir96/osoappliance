## Troubleshooting Descaling Your Appliance

Descaling an appliance is an important maintenance task required to keep their performance running optimally. If you're experiencing frustration due to your descale light not going off, here are some tips to troubleshoot the issue.

First, review your owner's manual to ensure you're completing the descaling process correctly. This will ensure you don't inadvertently cause further damage while trying to solve the problem. If you still find that your descaling light won't turn off, there may be a few different variables at play.

For example, if your apppliance doesn't detect sufficient descaling fluid, the light will not switch off. This is to ensure that your appliance runs at maximum performance. If this is the case, you'll need to continue the descaling cycle with enough liquid for the apppliance to register its presence.

In some cases, the descaling itself may be completed correctly, yet the light still won't switch off. In such a situation, ensure that your appliance is connected to a working power source, as sometimes power issues can stop the process from completing.

Descaling an appliance can be a tricky process if not done correctly.
