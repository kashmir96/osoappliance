## Uncovering Bosch Dishwasher Error Code E92
Has your Bosch dishwasher all of a sudden stopped working and is displaying error code E92? Before you call a repairman or start replacing parts, letâ€™s take a few minutes to understand what this error code means and how to fix it. 

This article outlines the repair steps associated with error code E92, which can occur on older Bosch dishwashers. Error code E92 usually indicates a faulty heater. This is usually accompanied with an LED light blinking 6 times, then a pause, and then repeating over and over. 

When this error code is displayed, you'll want to check and troubleshoot the following components:

- Heater Chamber: Start by making sure the heater chamber is sufficiently tightened and free from any debris or clogs. 
- Heater Sensor: Check the heater for a defective sensor/thermostat. This would likely require professional help to have it replaced.
- Wiring/Connector: Make sure the wiring and connectors around the heater area of the dishwasher are fully connected and not loose or burnt.

Although these three steps should be done to help identify the source of the error code E92, it may still be necessary to replace or repair some of the parts.
