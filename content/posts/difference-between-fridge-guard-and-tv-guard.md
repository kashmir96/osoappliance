The Fridge Guard and TV Guard are both products designed to protect your electronics from power outages and surges. But, they are not the same thing. 

Fridge Guard is a device that plugs into your refrigerator or freezer outlet to monitor the power supply and protect it from electrical power surges. It works by automatically shutting off the power when it senses a potential problem, thus protecting your valuable food items inside. The Fridge Guard also has an alarm that can alert you if there is a potential problem, so you can take action right away. 

TV Guard, on the other hand, is a device that plugs into your television outlet to monitor and protect it from electrical spikes due to lightning strikes or other causes of damage. It works by cutting off the power supply as soon as it detects a surge, thus preventing damage to your television set or any other connected electronic devices. Unlike Fridge Guard, TV Guard does not have an alarm feature â€“ instead, it relies on its sensors to detect any issues with the electricity supply before any damage can occur. 

In conclusion, while both devices are designed for protecting electronic equipment from surges and outages due to lightning strikes or other causes of damage, they differ in terms of their design and functionality - Fridge Guard has an alarm feature while TV Guard does not.
