## Identifying a Malfunctioning Whirlpool Washer
If you've ever come home and found your Whirlpool washer with a waterlogged load, or worse, with water all over the floor, you know the frustration of a Whirlpool washer not draining or spinning. Knowing the cause of a stalled washer can help you fix it, or if needed, call in a technician for assistance. 

There are a few common causes of a broken washer, including clogged drain hoses, malfunctioning pumps and broken belts. The best way to check is to first locate and remove the drain hose(s) and inspect them for any blockages or kinks that may impede the draining or spinning of the washer. Once this is done, check the outlet hose attached to the pump. Make sure that it is securely attached and is properly draining the water out of the washer. 

Another issue to look for is if the washerâ€™s drive belt has become unhinged. This often happens when the pulley is not properly secured or when the screws holding the belt drive in place become loose. In this instance, you may have to get help from an appliance repair specialist. Lastly, if the belt seems to be in place, but the washer is still not draining or spinning, the motor may need to be replaced. 

No matter what the cause of the malfunction, it is important to address the issue quickly, as a non-working washer can cause a lot of damage in the home. Consulting with a reliable appliance service and repair specialist is the best way to ensure your Whirlpool washer is running properly and efficiently.
