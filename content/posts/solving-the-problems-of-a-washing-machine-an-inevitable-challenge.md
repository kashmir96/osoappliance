Also, the unit may not be able to sufficiently agitate or could vibrate during the spins. Other common problems could include a water leak, cleaning inefficiencies and unable to adjust the temperature or water level.

* How can I determine whether the sound my washing machine is making is normal or not?
 - Many washing machines emit a small noise when in operation, however a noise that increases in volume, rattles or squeaks can indicate a problem. If the noise increases from its usual level, you should investigate further.

* How to prevent a washing machine from leaking?
 - To prevent a washing machine from leaking, there are several steps. First, ensure that the hoses are securely connected to the ports.

* How often should I clean and maintain the washing machine?
 - It is important to clean and maintain your washing machine regularly to ensure that it is working efficiently. A good practice is to clean the inside of the washing machine at least once a month to clear any lint or residue buildup. Additionally, you should check the hoses and gaskets for any signs of wear and tear once every 6 months.

* What could be done if I cannot adjust the settings according to my preference?
