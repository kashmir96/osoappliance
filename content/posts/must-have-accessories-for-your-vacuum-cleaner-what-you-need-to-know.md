## Essential Vacuum Cleaner Accessories to Boost Efficiency

When it comes to cleaning, having the right vacuum cleaner is just as important as having the right set of accessories. Not only do these additional items help increase the efficiency of cleaning, but they can also make the process that much easier. So what are the must-have accessories for your vacuum cleaner?

### Brush Attachments

Brush attachments are essential for helping to loosen and pick up dirt around edges, and for cleaning furniture and upholstery. The physical motion of the brush helps to loosen the dirt which is then sucked up into the vacuum. These attachments come in different widths and shapes, so ensure you get the one best suited to your needs.

### Extension Tube

An extension tube is also a great accessory to have, as it allows you to clean high spaces, such as ceiling corners, or hard to reach areas. These tubes come in a variety of sizes, so be sure to choose one that is the right length for efficiently cleaning your home.

### Hose

A hose is a useful and multi-purpose tool. As well as being able to access tight spaces, the hose can also be used to pick up bigger, heavier items such as toys or pet hair. Additionally, a hose can be used with a various range of brushes - enabling you to switch between different types of cleaner head easily.

### Filter

A filter is essential for keeping your home looking and feeling fresh. Recycled air can quickly become filled with dust and particles, however, using a filter can help to ensure particle and allergens are quickly and easily removed from the air. Filters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so ensure you purchase one that is compatible with your vacuum cleaner.

Having the right set of accessories is essential for ensuring your home stays clean and hygienic. Vacuum cleaners have come a long way and now come with a variety of features in order to make cleaning that much easier. Increasing the efficiency of your cleaning process with additional accessories is a great way to keep your home looking tidy for longer.
