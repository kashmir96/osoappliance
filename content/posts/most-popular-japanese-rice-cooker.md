A Japanese rice cooker is a kitchen appliance that cooks rice quickly and efficiently. It has become a staple in many Japanese kitchens, as it is incredibly useful for cooking large amounts of perfectly-cooked rice in a short amount of time. 

The most popular type of Japanese rice cooker is the “kamado-san”, which translates literally to “rice pot”. This type of cooker uses an inner pot made out of ceramic or metal that can be filled with up to 10 cups (2 litres) of uncooked rice. The outer shell is metal and houses the heating elements and controls. The inner pot sits on top of the heating element, which cooks the rice evenly and keeps it warm until it’s ready to eat. Most kamado-san cookers also come with additional features such as timers, warming functions, and even steamers so you can cook vegetables while your rice cooks!

Another popular type of Japanese rice cooker is the “tataki-style” or “pressure cooker” style. This type uses high pressure steam to quickly cook large amounts of uncooked grains like brown or wild rice in one go. It also comes with several settings so you can adjust how much moisture you want your cooked grains to have — perfect for making sushi! Pressure cookers are more expensive than kamado-san cookers but they are very energy efficient since they use less energy than other types to get the job done quickly. 

No matter which style you choose, having a quality Japanese rice cooker will make preparing meals much easier by providing perfectly cooked grains every time!
