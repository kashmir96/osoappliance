## Don't Live with a Broken Washing Machine - There's a Better Way 
If your washing machine has broken down and you want to know what to do next, you don’t have to put up with it as it is. You can decide to either repair or replace it for a better and improved performance. You should avoid using a broken washing machine as it could be hazardous and damage your home and clothes.

Unlike other home appliances, a washing machine is used almost every day. When it breaks down you should act quickly to get it fixed. There are a few signs that may tell you that the time to replace the machine has come, rather than doing repairs. 

If you find yourself noticing any of these signs on your washing machine, it’s time to look for a replacement: 
* Loud and strange noises
* Leaking and excessive vibration
* Takes a long time to finish a cycle 
* Poor washing performance
* All of these are signs that the machine is not functioning properly and could be wasting a lot of energy and water as well.

If these issues aren’t anything major, then you can get it repaired. But if repairs will cost you more than the actual price of the machine, it’s best to get a new one. Washing machines can be expensive, so try to find one that will fit your needs, budget and space.

Buying a new washing machine can feel daunting, but you don’t have to be intimidated by it. Take your time to research the features and models of washing machines in the market, read user reviews, and find which one fits best for your home.

When it comes to repairs of your washing machine, it is always best to seek professional help. It can be dangerous to try to repair a washing machine yourself, as you need the right tools and wiring knowledge to do it correctly.
