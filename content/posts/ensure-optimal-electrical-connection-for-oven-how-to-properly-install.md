By following these steps, you can ensure the optimal electrical connection for your oven installation.

When making the electrical connection, it is essential to pay attention to the voltage rating of the oven to avoid overloading the circuits.

By following these steps, you can ensure your oven installation is secure and safe, and that you don't run the risk of overloading your circuits.
