If you're a homeowner, you know how important it is to keep your air conditioning system in good working order. Unfortunately, even the most well-maintained systems can suffer from wear and tear over time, and require replacement parts once in a while. To make sure your system is running smoothly and efficiently all year long, here's a list of essential air conditioning spare parts that should be kept on hand. 

1. Filters: Air filters are one of the most important air conditioning parts as they help reduce dust, dirt, and other airborne particles from circulating throughout your home. It's important to check and replace your air filters every couple of months, or whenever they become dirty or clogged. 

2. Blower Motor: The blower motor is responsible for distributing cool air throughout your home by turning the fan blades inside the unit. If the motor is faulty or damaged, it can prevent your system from cooling properly, so it's important to have a spare on hand if necessary. 

3. Condenser Coils: Condenser coils are found in outdoor units and help to keep the refrigerant cool while it passes through the system. If these coils get dirty or wear down over time, they won't be able to do their job correctly—causing a decrease in efficiency and possibly even an increase in energy costs. 

4. Refrigerant Lines: As its name suggests, refrigerant lines carry liquid refrigerant between components within the system—helping to transfer heat from one part of your home to another for cooling purposes. Refrigerant lines can become cracked or damaged over time due to exposure to extreme temperatures, so having backups on hand is essential for keeping your AC running smoothly all year long! 

5. Thermostats: Thermostats control how often your AC runs and how much cool air is produced when it does run—so having an extra on hand ensures that you'll always be able to adjust settings as needed without compromising performance or energy efficiency! 

6. Fan Motors & Blades: Your fan motors and blades are responsible for recirculating air around your home and helping keep it cooler during hot summer months—so keeping spares on hand ensures that you'll never be without this essential component if something goes wrong with yours! 

Keeping these spare parts handy will ensure that any problems with your AC can be solved quickly and easily without having to wait around for repairs or replacements—saving you time, money and hassle in the long run!
