If you’re like many people, you might not realize how important it is to follow proper washing machine guidelines. It’s easy to just throw your clothes in the washer and assume everything will come out clean and looking good, but that isn’t always the case. Following these guidelines can help you get the most out of your washing machine and clothes.

1. Sort Your Clothes: Make sure to sort your laundry into piles based on items needing a cold wash, items needing a warm wash, items needing a hot wash, and any delicate or hand-wash only items. This ensures that all of your clothing gets washed at the correct temperature setting so they don’t shrink or become damaged during the cycle. 

2. Read Care Labels: Before putting any item in the washing machine, make sure to read its care label first! This will tell you exactly what temperature setting is best for that item as well as whether or not it should be air-dried or tumble dried on low heat (if applicable). 

3. Use Detergent Properly: Many people tend to use too much detergent when doing laundry which can lead to unwanted suds in the washer as well as residue being left on clothes after they have been washed. To avoid this problem, make sure to measure out an appropriate amount of detergent according to what type of load you are washing (for example heavier loads require more detergent than lighter loads). 

4. Clean Your Washer Regularly: Make sure to clean out your washing machine regularly by running an empty load with vinegar or bleach at least once a month (check your washer’s manual for specific instructions). This will help keep bacteria from building up inside of your machine and also ensure that it runs efficiently over time by removing any built up residue from previous cycles. 

Following these simple guidelines can help ensure that all of your clothing comes out clean and looking great after each cycle! It also helps extend the life of both your clothes and washer by ensuring everything is being washed correctly each time.
