## Resolving Common Dishwasher Error Codes

An error code displayed on the dashboard of your home dishwasher can be quite alarming. Fortunately, however, most common codes can be reset and the dishwasher brought back to normal operation in a few simple steps.

If you ever encounter an error code on your dishwasher, the first step is to refer to the appliance’s user manual for the definition of the code. By looking up the code in the manual, you can determine and address the underlying issue. Common issues may include blocked filters, clogged spray arms, and circuit malfunctions.

If the error code is due to a blocked filter, you can simply clean the filter, unblock the drain hose, and the dishwasher should be restored to normal operation. Similarly, clogged spray arms can be cleaned and returned to normal, functioning condition. If the issue is more complex or requires replacing parts, you’ll need to contact your appliance provider to ensure the work is done correctly.

Once you’ve determined the cause of the problem and fixed it, the error code will usually reset itself and the dishwasher will restart as normal. 

Error codes are an annoying part of owning a dishwasher, but by following the instructions above, you can return your machine to normal operation quickly and safely. If you’re ever uncertain about the best method for resolving an error code, refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to find the explanation and solution.
