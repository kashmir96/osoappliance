If your dryer is no longer working, it can be incredibly frustrating. While the most common cause of a malfunctioning dryer is usually something simple like a clogged lint filter or an overloaded circuit breaker, there are other potential causes that can be more difficult to diagnose and repair. Before you call an appliance repair technician from our directory, here are a few things you should try to get your dryer back up and running again. 

First, check the power source. Make sure the dryer is plugged in securely and that the outlet has power (you can test it with another appliance). If all looks good on this front, move on to checking the lint filter – if it’s clogged with too much lint buildup, this could be preventing air flow through your drum and keeping your clothes from drying properly. 

Next, make sure nothing is blocking or restricting air flow inside the dryer cabinet or vent system. Clothes hangers stuck in vents or debris lodged in the ductwork may cause issues as well as reduce efficiency over time. 

Finally, take a look at any safety features built into your model of dryer such as anti-overheating features that may have tripped due to excessive heat build-up inside the drum chamber. If these features seem to be functioning properly then it’s time to inspect more closely for other root causes such as a faulty door switch or motor issue – at this point you may need professional help so contact one of our local appliance repair technicians if needed!
