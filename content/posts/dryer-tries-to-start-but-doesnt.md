If your dryer tries to start but doesn’t, it can be a frustrating experience. There are a few common causes as to why your dryer might be having trouble starting. First, check to make sure that your dryer is plugged in properly. If it is, then you should check the circuit breaker or fuse box to make sure the circuit is not tripped. If it is, reset the circuit and try to start the dryer again.

If the circuit is not tripped, then you should check the door switch. This switch is located on the door of the dryer and ensures that the dryer will not start when the door is open. If the switch is faulty, it can prevent the dryer from starting. To test the switch, open the door and press the switch. If it does not click, then the switch needs to be replaced.

If the door switch is working, then the problem could be with the motor. The motor is responsible for turning the drum and is powered by the start capacitor. If the start capacitor has failed, the motor will not be able to start. To test the start capacitor, you will need to use a multimeter to measure the voltage. If the voltage is below the minimum required, then the start capacitor needs to be replaced.

Finally, the problem could be with the thermal fuse. This fuse is designed to prevent the dryer from overheating and will shut off power to the motor if it senses too much heat. To test the thermal fuse, you will need to use a multimeter to measure the resistance. If the resistance is too high, then the thermal fuse needs to be replaced.

If you have checked all of these components and the dryer still does not start, then you may need to call a professional appliance repair technician.
