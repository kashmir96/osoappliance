## Reducing Noise from a Washing Machine

Are you dealing with a noisy washing machine coating walls and rooms with a loud, rumbling sound? If so, you’re certainly not alone. It’s quite common for a washing machine to become noisy during its spin cycle. While you’ll likely have to call an appliance repair technician to properly diagnose and fix the issue, there are a few things you can try to reduce noise from a washing machine.

First, keep the washing machine on a level surface and make sure the legs are properly adjusted. This will help to ensure that the machine is not unbalanced which can ultimately exacerbate any noise issues. For front-loading washers, thoroughly clean the gasket and door seal. This is the rubber material that lines the door. Over time, detergent and fabric softener residue can build up and cause the gasket to harden, which can lead to a rumbling sound. Be sure to use a damp cloth and soapy water to clear away any residue.

Also, check the lid switch and look for any sign of wear and tear. The lid switch is designed to stop the machine when the lid is open, so any issues with the switch could lead to increased noise. If the lid switch looks to be in proper working order and your machine is still noisy, try taking a look at the motor or the pump. Make sure the motor or pump is properly aligned. If it appears to be off balance, then you may need to adjust it with a screwdriver before use.

While there are several measures you can take to reduce the noise from your washing machine, only a professional appliance repair technician can identify the issue for sure.
