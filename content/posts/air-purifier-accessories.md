Air purifiers are a great way to improve the air quality in your home and reduce allergens, irritants, and pollutants. But, like most appliances, they come with a variety of accessories that can help make them even more effective. Here is a list of some of the most popular air purifier accessories on the market today:

1. Pre-Filters: Pre-filters are often sold separately from air purifiers as an extra layer of protection for your system. They capture large particles such as dust, pet dander, and hair before they reach the main filter in your unit. This helps reduce strain on the main filter and extends its life. 

2. Activated Carbon Filters: Activated carbon filters are used to remove odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air in your home. They work by adsorbing particles onto their surface area through chemical bonds that trap them until they’re removed when you replace or clean the filter. 

3. UV Lights: Ultraviolet lights are often used in conjunction with other filters to help eliminate microbes such as mold spores, bacteria, and viruses from your indoor air supply. Be sure to check with your manufacturer for specific instructions on how to safely use UV lights in your unit so you don’t damage yourself or the equipment itself! 

4. Ionizers: Ionizers work by releasing negatively charged ions into the air which attach themselves onto airborne particles such as dust or pet dander which then fall out of circulation due to gravity rather than being recirculated back into the room like other pollutants would be without an ionizer being present! 

 With these four common accessories for improving indoor air quality with an air purifier, you can easily upgrade your unit so it runs more efficiently while also providing better overall protection against hazardous airborne contaminants!
