When it comes to outfitting a commercial kitchen, one of the major purchases that you’ll need to make is a commercial dishwasher. Depending on the type and size of the dishwasher you need, the cost can vary greatly. Generally speaking, however, you should expect to pay anywhere from $1,500 - $10,000 for a commercial dishwasher. 

The exact cost of your commercial dishwasher will depend on several factors including its brand name, size and features. Cheaper models may come with fewer features but offer basic washing capabilities while more expensive models may feature advanced capabilities such as built-in water softening systems or integrated sensors that monitor water temperature and detergent levels. 

In addition to the initial cost of purchasing a commercial dishwasher, there are also ongoing costs associated with operating it such as energy usage, detergent costs and maintenance fees. It’s important to factor these costs into your budget when making your purchase decision so that you have an accurate assessment of how much it will actually cost to run your machine over time. 

For those looking for an even more affordable option than buying a new machine outright, there are plenty of options available for renting or leasing commercial dishwashers as well. The cost for this option can range anywhere from a few hundred dollars per month up into the thousands depending on its size and features. This can be an attractive option for businesses who want access to higher-end machines without having to invest in outright ownership initially. 

No matter what type of budget you’re working with when outfitting your kitchen with equipment like a commercial dishwasher, there are plenty of options available that can fit within it; from buying outright or leasing or renting one depending on what best suits your needs
