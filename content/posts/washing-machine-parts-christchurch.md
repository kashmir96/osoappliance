Whether you’re in the market for a new washing machine or just need to maintain your existing one, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the different parts that make up a washing machine. This blog is here to explain the different parts of a washing machine and how they work together to get your clothes clean. Then we'll cover where to source parts in Christchurch should you need to maintain or upgrade your machine.

The Drum: The drum is the biggest part of a washing machine and is where the clothes are placed for washing. It’s made of metal and has a perforated surface which helps to agitate the clothes during the wash cycle. The drum has holes on the sides to allow water and detergent to enter and exit. 

The Motor: The motor is the part of the washing machine that powers the drum and other components. It’s usually located at the bottom of the washing machine and is connected to the drum through a belt or gears. 

The Pump: The pump is the part of the washing machine that pumps the water in and out of the drum. The pump is usually located at the bottom of the washing machine and is connected to the drum through a hose. 

The Timer: The timer is the part of the washing machine that controls the length of time that the washing cycle runs. It’s usually located at the top of the washing machine and is connected to the motor through wires. 

The Detergent Dispenser: The detergent dispenser is the part of the washing machine that dispenses the detergent into the drum during the wash cycle. It’s usually located at the top of the washing machine and is connected to the drum through a hose. 

The Control Panel: The control panel is the part of the washing machine that allows you to set the washing cycle and other settings. It’s usually located at the top of the washing machine and is connected to the motor and other components through wires. 

Understanding these parts of a washing machine is important. If you’re having trouble with your washing machine or need to purchase parts, it’s always best to consult with a professional, but knowing the above can definitely save you money in the long run by avoiding unnecessary call-outs.
