## Why Do People Put Aluminum Foil in the Dishwasher? 

Have you ever wondered why people put aluminum foil in the dishwasher? Maybe you’ve been tempted to try it yourself, or maybe you’re a bit concerned as to exactly why this is a thing. Well, within this blog, we’ll be exploring the reasons why people use aluminum foil within the dishwasher and whether or not it’s a healthy and safe practice for you and your home appliances. 

There are a few common tips that you may have come across in regards to aluminum foil and dishwashers. One of the most popular is to place aluminium foil on the bottom of the dishwasher. This provides a number of benefits. Firstly, it helps to protect the dishwasher from corrosion and build-up of debris, such as food and grease. The aluminum acts as a barrier and keeps the dishwasher surfaces clean. It also prevents certain utensils from making contact with the bottom of the dishwasher, which can potentially cause scratches and damage over time. 

Aluminum foil can also be used to line the top racks of the dishwasher, next to the sprayers. This has the benefit of ensuring that your glasses and china remain cleaner during the cycle, as the aluminum can reflect the water droplets away from the dish. It’s also possible to improve drying time, as the aluminum can absorb the heat and then conduct it, helping to speed up the drying process. 

Whilst there are a few useful tips associated with using aluminum foil in the dishwasher, it’s important to remember that not all things you come across on the internet are true. Firstly, you should never place aluminum foil in the bottom of the dishwasher, as this can cause electric shocks and lead to more serious damages. It’s also important to ensure that the aluminum foil is placed in the correct position and that it doesn’t come into contact with any of the dishwasher’s electrical components. 

To get the most out of your dishwasher and keep it running in top condition, it’s always best to refer to the manufacturer manual, or reach out to a certified technician with any questions or queries.
