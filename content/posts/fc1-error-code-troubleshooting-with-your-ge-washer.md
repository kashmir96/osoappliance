## FC1 Error Code Troubleshooting for GE Washer

Are you the proud owner of a GE Washer? Are you now experiencing an FC1 error code? Don't worry! It's easier than ever to troubleshoot this issue. Understanding exactly what the FC1 error code means is the first step in getting your GE Washer up and running again.

The FC1 Error Code usually appears when a GE Washer is not draining as it should be. This is typically caused by the pump filter being blocked by lint or some sort of debris. The first step towards resolving the issue is to remove the blockage from the pump filter. The pump filter is usually located on the bottom front near the lower left corner. After you have located it, you'll need to unplug the washer, then remove the filter to clean it out. 

Once you have finished washing out the filter, reinstall it and turn the washer back on. If this doesn't resolve the issue, then you may need to remove the drain hose that runs between the washer and the backflow preventer to check for any clogs or blockages in the hose. If the hose is blocked, simply remove the blockage and reinstall the hose. 

If all of the steps above are followed, you should be able to resolve the issue and get your washer back up and running in no time. Of course, if these steps donâ€™t work, it's always a good idea to reach out to a service technician to get an expert opinion.
