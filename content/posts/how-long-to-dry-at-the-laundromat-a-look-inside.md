###### Taking the Guesswork Out of Laundromat Drying
Drying laundry at the laundromat can be a tricky task - even guessing correctly how long clothes will take to dry can be a challenge. Knowing when to switch over to the dryer and ensuring that everything is adequately dried is of utmost importance. Let's take a look inside the various components involved in drying clothes in the laundromat and find out the best ways to tackle the job.

At a laundromat, it's important to remember that there are two machines involved: the washer and the dryer. While it is possible to dry clothes without using a washer, it is not recommended due to the risk of faster wear and tear. When using the washer, the first step is to read the instructions of the machine in order to select the appropriate cycle and water temperature. Water temperature plays an important role in how quickly the clothes dry. After the cycle has completed, the washing machine automatically empties the water which is when it's time to move on to the dryer.

When using the dryer, it's important to select the correct cycle. High temperature cycles should be avoided since they can cause clothes to wrinkle and shrink. Additionally, it is important to regularly check the lint trap to ensure the machine is running efficiently. Once the cycle is complete, it's time to take the clothes out and fold them. If clothes are still damp, it may be necessary to go through the drying cycle a second or third time.

Determining the correct amount of time to use the dryer is largely dependent on the type of clothes being dried. Cotton items usually take longer to dry than synthetic materials, and large items such as comforters and blankets may take even more time. Generally speaking, it is best to do a few test runs until the desired dryness is achieved and then use that as a benchmark for drying similar types of items.

The best approach to drying at the laundromat is to pay attention to the instructions and follow the suggested cycles and temperatures. Additionally, testing out different drying periods is a good way to find out what works best for different types of garments. By understanding the process in detail, it can be easier to take the guesswork out of drying at the laundromat. 

Taking the time to really understand the complexities of the laundromat drying process can save you time and energy when trying to get those clothes dry.
