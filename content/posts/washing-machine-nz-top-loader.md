As a Kiwi, when it comes to doing laundry there is no one-size fits all solution. With the wide range of washing machines available in New Zealand, choosing the right one for your needs can be tricky. One popular option is the top loader washing machine.

Top loaders are great for those who don’t want to bend over to load and unload their machine. They also tend to be less expensive than front loaders and require less energy to run. However, top loaders are not ideal for everyone. They often use more water than front loading machines, so if you’re looking for an energy-efficient option, this isn’t the best choice. Furthermore, they also don’t perform as well on larger loads as front loading machines do.

If you’re looking for a reliable, cost-effective and easy-to-use washing machine, then a top loader might be the right option for you. You won’t have to bend down to get your clothes out of the washer and they can handle smaller loads with ease. Plus, they come in a variety of sizes so you can find one that best fits your needs. 

Overall, top loading washing machines are an excellent option for Kiwis who want an efficient and cost-effective way to do their laundry without taking up too much space or energy usage in their home.
