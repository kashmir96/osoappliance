# Is trade me or marketplace better for buying appliances in nz

Making big purchases, such as household appliances, can be daunting. In New Zealand, two of the most popular online marketplaces are Trade Me and Marketplace. With each having different advantages and disadvantages, it can be difficult to decide which is better for buying appliances in NZ. 

Trade Me is a New Zealand-based company that offers an auction marketplace with over 3 million items listed daily. It's free to list items on Trade Me and many traders offer free shipping or pick up options. The advantage of buying through Trade Me is that buyers have the ability to bid on their desired item and may get a lower price than its original value (particularly if there are multiple people who are interested in the same item). Additionally, it has a wide range of payment methods like credit cards, PayPal and bank transfers. 

On the other hand, Marketplace is an online store platform that allows businesses to sell their products directly to customers all over New Zealand. Since businesses have control over their prices and deals, buyers often benefit from discounts on bulk orders or bundle deals (e.g., buy a TV + sound system at a discounted price). One major advantage for using Marketplace is that it offers more guarantees in terms of quality assurance and warranties since businesses are more responsible for providing more customer service compared to individual sellers on Trade Me. 

In conclusion, both Trade Me and Marketplace have their own pros and cons as well as different audiences they appeal to when buying appliances in NZ. Ultimately it comes down to what type of deal you’re looking for - whether you’re after the best value or complete peace-of-mind when shopping online - so take some time to compare both before making your next purchase!
