## Solving & Preventing 5 Common Cooker Faults

Owning a cooker can be both convenient and enjoyable, allowing you to quickly prepare delicious meals with minimal effort. Yet, as with all appliances, cookers must be monitored and maintained in order to remain safe and functional. This article will highlight 5 of the most common faults that can occur with cookers, and provide advice and tips to resolve them.

### 1. Ignition Issues

Ignition issues are one of the most common problems associated with gas cookers, and are often caused by a loose electrical connection in the parts responsible for the sparks that ignite the gas. Inspect all the electrical components of your cooker as soon as possible to prevent unfortunate and potentially dangerous scenarios from occurring.

### 2. Temperature Issues

If your cooker is failing to reach the desired temperature then this could be an indicator that faulty components are present in your cookerâ€™s thermostat. Altering the temperature should occur almost immediately, so if it is taking significantly longer than usual then this should be cause for concern.

### 3. Leaks 

A leak in a gas cooker is a significant safety issue and should be dealt with promptly. Leaks can be caused by numerous factors, but the most frequent culprits in modern cookers tend to be blocked valves or corroded connections. 

### 4. Fumes 

If you notice that there is a pervasive smell of gas in your kitchen, even when your cooker is switched off, it may be indicative of a gas leak. Be sure to both switch off the gas supply and ventilate the kitchen before attempting to investigate further.

### 5. Blocked Burners 

The most common cause of blocked burners is food residue which has become ensconced in the holes of the burner. Remove blockages as soon as possible to ensure maximum efficiency from your cooker.

In conclusion, it is essential for safety that cooker faults are identified and repaired promptly.

## 5 Common Cooker Faults & How To Fix Them

1. **What should I do if my oven won't heat up?** 
This is likely due to an issue with the heating elements. Make sure to check the elements for any signs of damage such as burn marks, sparks or arcing. You may need to have an engineer to check the circuit or switch on the control panel.

2. **My built-in oven's timer isn't working - what could be causing this?** 
The most likely cause could be a faulty timer button or timer motor. If you are unable to replace either of these components and they turn out to be the culprit, you may need to employ the services of an appliance engineer.

3. **The stove top burners work intermittently - what should I do?** 
It could be that the burner is blocked with food crumbs or dirt. To check, clean and remove any food particles or dirt buildup that may be causing the issue. Additionally, check the connection on the back of the burner and the igniter to ensure the connections are secure.

4. **Why won't my stove turn on?** 
It is likely due to a tripped circuit breaker. Check that the circuit breaker is on, or reset it if necessary. If this doesn't solve the issue, you may need to hire a qualified electrician to perform further testing and repairs.

5. **My oven's temperature is not accurate - how can I fix this?** 
Check the thermostat in the oven to make sure it is properly aligned and correctly calibrated. If necessary, you can adjust the temperature control knob to adjust the thermostat. You may also need the assistance of a qualified engineer to make further adjustments to the thermostat.
