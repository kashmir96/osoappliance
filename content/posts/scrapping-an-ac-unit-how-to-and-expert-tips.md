## Safely Removing an Old AC Unit 

Is your old AC not cooperating with the changing temperatures outside? Are you looking to upgrade to a more energy-efficient unit? If you're looking to scrap your old AC unit, it's important to prep and clean it properly to get the most return on your investment. 

No matter what type of air conditioning unit you have, the basic steps of dismantling it are similar. Unless you feel comfortable doing it yourself, it’s best to find a professional who can help you safely take apart and haul away the unit. 

An HVAC technician can help you remove the two copper refrigerant lines that connect the outdoor AC unit to the system inside. A technician will use an AC service valve to disconnect the lines with minimal pressure release, taking it from there and evacuating the refrigerant to comply with the local laws and regulations.

The technician will then access the condenser fan motor in order to encapsulate the lead wires that join the motor to the contactor and the fan blade. After that, the technician will begin to loosen the mounting bolts on the sides, lower, and top sections of the outdoor unit in order to prepare it for removal. Following that, an HVAC technician will take a screwdriver or trade knife, remove the weatherstrip and prepare the unit to be hauled away.

When it’s finally ready to go, an HVAC technician will then be able to cart away and recycle your old AC unit responsibly. 

Once your old AC unit is taken away and the area is cleaned up, you can start shopping for the right replacement and consider having it professionally installed. To make sure you find the ideal AC for your home, why not review our [Overview of Top Appliance](./pages/appliance-overview) for help and guidance.
