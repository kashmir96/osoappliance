## Tips for Uninstalling a No-Longer-Functional Washing Machine
Any appliance breakdown can be frustrating, but when it comes to a washing machine, you can't afford to procrastinate. If your washing machine isn't working and it's time for you to get rid of it, you must take the necessary steps to properly uninstall it. Removing a washing machine takes more than just plugging it out. Here are a few tips to help you successfully uninstall a dead washing machine.

### Start with the Disconnect
The most important part of uninstalling a washing machine is to disconnect it from the power supply. Before disconnecting anything, make sure to turn off the breakers or switches associated with the washing machine. This will help keep you safe from any electrical shock. After turning off the power, disconnect the wires in the back. This will involve exploring the back of the washer to determine what the setup is. Generally, you'll find power cords and hot and cold water hoses that need to be unplugged. Also, if the washing machine is plumbed, you must coordinate with the local municipal plumbing department to properly unplumb or drain pipes.

### Give Yourself Time
Uninstalling a dead washing machine can be a lengthy process, so it's important to give yourself enough time to finish the process. First, you will need to make sure to keep the area clear of any obstacles. If your washer is next to the wall, you'll need to move any furniture or other items that are in the way. You also may need to take off the trim around the washer. Be sure to remember which screws go where, as you'll need them if you plan on replacing the washer with a new one.

### Recycle Smartly 
After safely uninstalling the washing machine, you'll need to figure out how you will dispose of the machine. If your local dump doesn't accept old appliances, you may need to look up an appliance recycling center. If you don't want to take on the hassle of recycling it yourself, there are services that will do it for you for a fee.

Uninstalling a dead washing machine can be a daunting task, but with the right knowledge and tools, it doesn't have to be. By following these quick tips and preparing in advance, you can properly uninstall your washing machine and get it off your property safely and quickly. 

When it comes to replacing your washing machine, you need the help of a qualified appliance repair technician. To locate an expert near you, check out our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
