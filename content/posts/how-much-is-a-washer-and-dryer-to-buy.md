When it comes to buying a washer and dryer, the cost varies depending on the size of the unit, the type of machine you purchase, and any additional features. Generally speaking, a washer and dryer can range anywhere from $400 to over $2,000.

For example, front-loading machines are typically more expensive than top-loading machines. Front-loaders often offer more efficient cleaning performance since they use less water and energy while cleaning better than traditional top loaders. Additionally, high-end models may feature more advanced technology such as steaming capabilities or Wi-Fi connectivity. These features can add hundreds of dollars onto the cost.

The size of your machine is also an important factor in determining its price tag. Smaller units that fit apartments or condos may be less expensive than larger capacity machines for families with bigger laundry needs. The larger capacity also means higher energy bills when running so consider this in your decision making process as well! 

In terms of installation costs for both washers and dryers, it depends largely on what kind of setup you already have in your home or apartment building. If you're replacing an existing appliance then there could be extra fees associated with disconnecting your old unit and reconnecting a new one - especially if electricity is involved - so you'll want to factor those costs into your budget too! 

It's important to shop around when looking for a washer/dryer combo because prices can vary greatly between retailers due to brand reputation or special offers so make sure you do plenty of research before committing to buy anything! Ultimately though it's up to personal preference which will help determine how much (or little) money is spent on appliances like these!
