## Understanding the Most Common Causes of Refrigerator Failure

Selecting an appliance for your home is no easy task. Refrigerators tend to be more expensive and less interchangeable than other household appliances, so it's important to understand what could possibly go wrong. As a general consumer and user of household appliances, it is beneficial to identify the most common causes of refrigerator failure so that you know what to look out for throughout the life of this essential appliance. 

The most common causes of refrigerator failure are related to small thermostat malfunctions, the compressor, or faulty wiring within the appliance. When the thermostat malfunctions, it can cause the refrigerator to cycle between cold and warm temperatures, resulting in an inefficient and possibly dangerous machine. Compressor malfunctions are not only common, but can also be expensive as compressor repairs are often sophisticated and require special tools. Lastly, faulty wiring could be caused by chewed wires from rodents or lack of maintenance, and can be a safety hazard.

Fortunately, these common refrigerator failure issues can often be addressed before any major repairs or maintenance is needed. Regularly cleaning the coils and checking for any visible signs of wear, such as exposed wires or a faulty gasket, can help you identify issues before they become more widespread. Additionally, yearly scheduled maintenance visits from a technician can help identify any more major issues, such as problems with the evaporator fan, before they become a bigger problem.
