## Get the Dish: A Comprehensive Look at Dishwasher Options
For most of us, washing dishes is a never-ending task. Whether we’re handwashing cups and plates or relying on a dishwasher, the chore always awaits us. If a dishwasher is what you’re considering to make your sink-to-dish drying duties easier and faster, then you’ll want to equip yourself with the knowledge to find the best option for your needs.

Choosing a dishwasher is no small decision. There are a wide range of styles and models on the market, from countertop and built-in to portable and panel-ready. Each one offers its own set of benefits and drawbacks depending on the size of the kitchen you’re working with, your budget, and type of lifestyle.

Let’s take a look at a few of the main dishwasher options available. 

One of the most common types of dishwasher is the built-in. It’s typically installed under a countertop and can be fitted with custom paneling if desired. The great thing about built-in dishwashers is that they offer a convenient and stylish installation option, and they’re typically more energy efficient than most other types. A downside, however, is that they require professional installation, which can add to the cost of the purchase. 

Countertop dishwashers, on the other hand, are usually the most affordable option and don’t require any installation work. They’re also typically smaller than built-in dishwashers and often more energy efficient. But, if you’re looking for a more attractive option, this isn’t it — you won’t be able to customize your countertop with paneling and it can take up valuable counter space. 

Portable and under-the-counter dishwashers offer a great solution for those who are short on space. Portable dishwashers run on wheels and need to be connected to a sink, while under-the-counter dishwashers are typically smaller and can be installed seamlessly into a kitchen island or countertop. The quality of these dishwasher models, however, is often in question, as they typically aren’t Energy Star rated or as efficient as the other types discussed. 

No matter which dishwasher type you’re leaning toward, it’s important to ask yourself a few questions. How much space you have to work with? How often you plan to use the dishwasher? What’s your budget? These questions and more will help you choose the dishwasher that better suits your needs. 

Doing your research and familiarizing yourself with the types of dishwashers available is an essential first step when it comes to finding the best model for your needs. Once you’ve chosen the perfect dishwasher, be sure to book an appliance repair technician to help you get it installed. At Appliance Repair Technicians, you’ll find a directory of the best professionals in your area and you can rest assured that your dishwasher is in capable hands. 

When it comes to making the right dishwasher decision for you and your family, understanding the options and doing your research is an essential starting point. Equipping yourself with the knowledge to make an informed decision can make all the difference. 

Now that you’re well-versed in the world of dishwashers, why not take the next step and find the perfect professional to help with the installation process? Head on over to our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians to get started.

## Get the Dish: Answering Top Dishwasher FAQs

**What is a dishwasher?**
A dishwasher is a home appliance used to clean and sanitize dirty dishes, like plates, bowls, cups, and silverware. Dishwashers use a combination of detergent, hot water, and pressure to remove food particles and stains from dishes.

**Which is better: built-in or portable dishwasher?**
The answer to this question depends on your needs. Built-in dishwashers are built in under the kitchen countertop and feature more functional, advanced features, while portable dishwashers offer more flexibility when it comes to placement and can easily be moved, so long as a water supply is nearby. 

**What should I keep in mind when shopping for a dishwasher?**
When shopping for a dishwasher, it is important to consider the size and capacity of the unit, its types of cycles, water and energy efficiency, the sound levels it produces, and any additional features you may be interested in. 

**How often should I clean my dishwasher?**
Your dishwasher should be cleaned at least every three months. This involves running an empty cycle with white vinegar and citrus peels to remove grease and grime, and any filtering components should also be washed and emptied.

**What should I do if my dishwasher stops working?**
If your dishwasher is no longer working, you should first check the power connection and circuit breaker to ensure they are both functioning correctly. If the breaker is tripped, try resetting it. If that doesn’t work, you should contact a service technician to inspect and repair your dishwasher.
