Whether you’re looking to upgrade your air purifier or just want to keep it running optimally, there are plenty of air purifier accessories out there that can help. IGIair offers a number of useful accessories to enhance your air purifying experience. Here, we’ll take a look at some of the most popular IGIair purifier accessories and how they can help improve your indoor air quality. 

1. Pre-Filters: Pre-filters are designed to catch larger particles that could otherwise clog up the main filters in your IGIair purifier. These pre-filters are washable and reusable, so you’ll save money on replacements over time. They also have an antimicrobial coating which helps prevent bacterial and fungal growth on the filter surface for added protection against airborne contaminants. 

2. Carbon Filters: Carbon filters contain activated charcoal which is great for trapping odors, smoke, chemicals and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air you breathe in your home or office. They need to be replaced periodically depending on usage so make sure you check them every few months for maximum performance. 

3. HEPA Filters: High efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters are designed to capture even the smallest particles such as dust mites, pet dander and pollen from the air passing through them. They’re incredibly effective at removing allergens from indoor spaces so they’re ideal if someone in your household suffers from allergies, asthma or other respiratory problems due to airborne contaminants in their environment. 

4. UV Lights: Ultraviolet (UV) light is a great way to neutralize bacteria and viruses in the air passing through your IGIair purifier. The UV light destroys the microorganisms on contact, helping to keep your indoor air safer and healthier for everyone in your home or office. 

5. Remote Control: For added convenience, many IGIair purifiers come with a remote control so you can easily adjust settings from across the room without having to get up and move around. This is especially helpful if you’re using the purifier in a large space or if you have difficulty getting around due to mobility issues. 

All of these accessories are designed to help make your IGIair purifier more efficient and effective at removing pollutants from the air in your home or office so you can enjoy cleaner, healthier air all year round.
