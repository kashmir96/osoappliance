## Average Lifespan of an LG Washer
When it comes to home appliances, it's critical to invest in reliable, high-quality items that will last for years. This helps ensure peak performance and maximum efficiency. So, when it comes to purchasing a washing machine, how long should you expect it to last?

The average lifespan of an LG washer is 10-15 years. This may seem like a long period of time, but it is important to note that most manufacturers expect a good eight-year lifespan from their machines. Among major appliances, washers tend to have a longer life expectancy than other devices such as dishwashers or refrigerators.

The most important factor to consider in determining the lifespan of an LG (or any other) washer is proper maintenance. To ensure that any appliance lasts its estimated longest possible lifespan, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s suggested maintenance and cleaning routine. Keep the washer clean to remove lint and rust, maintain the hoses to prevent engine-clogging, and periodically inspect the machine for wear and tears.

Regular maintenance of your LG washer can help extend its life expectancy beyond the average 10-15 years.
