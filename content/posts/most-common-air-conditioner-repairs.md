Air conditioners are a great way to keep your home cool and comfortable during the hot summer months. Unfortunately, like any appliance, air conditioners can break down and need repairs. The most common air conditioner repairs include refrigerant leaks, clogged or dirty filters, faulty compressors, and electrical problems. Here is a closer look at each of these issues to help you understand what might be wrong with your AC unit. 

Refrigerant Leaks: Refrigerant is used in air conditioning systems to help cool the air inside the house by changing its pressure and temperature. When there is a leak in the system, it can cause an issue with cooling. Refrigerant leaks can be caused by wear and tear on seals or tubing over time as well as damage from animals or weather conditions such as hail storms or heavy winds. To fix this problem you will need to have a professional come out and find where the leak is coming from so that they can repair it properly using specialized tools and materials. 

Clogged/Dirty Filters: Air filters are designed to trap dust particles, dirt, pet hair and other debris that might otherwise enter your home’s air supply if not filtered out. Over time these filters will become clogged which prevents them from doing their job properly leading to decreased efficiency of your AC unit as well as poor indoor air quality in your home. To fix this issue you should regularly check your filter for blockages or dirt build up so that it can be either cleaned or replaced when necessary depending on type of filter being used in your system (disposable vs reusable). 

Faulty Compressor: The compressor within an AC system is responsible for compressing refrigerant gas into liquid form which then helps with heat transfer throughout the system allowing it to cool down the surrounding environment inside of your home efficiently. If something goes wrong with this part then it will prevent proper cooling from occurring leading to higher energy bills due increased strain on other components working alongside the compressor such as fans or condensers.. To repair this issue you may need to replace certain parts within compressor itself depending on severity of damage which should only be attempted by qualified technicians given complexity involved with such repairs usually requiring specialized tools/equipment for successful completion 

Electrical Problems: Electrical components within an AC system are responsible for powering up all other parts involved making sure everything operates correctly during normal operation times however if there’s an issue present then they could lead major issues affecting functionality of entire unit itself ranging from reduced airflow/cooling output due lack power being supplied correctly through various components all way complete shutdown resulting no cooling whatsoever happening whatsoever . If you suspect any electrical related problems present then best course action would be call professional technician have them come inspect diagnose problem before attempting do anything yourself given dangers associated incorrect handling wiring associated devices . 

In conclusion, these are some of the most common air conditioner repairs that may arise over time due wear & tear normal usage along potential external factors contributing towards their breakdowns . Taking care ensure regular maintenance checks occur performed help detect any potential issues earlier before they become bigger more expensive problems take resolve while also keeping running efficiently at same time , ultimately helping save money future costs .
