## A Comprehensive Look at What Shouldn't Be Dried in a Dehydrator

Dehydrating food has become a preferred method of preservation for many people, thanks to the versatility, convenience and cost savings of a home dehydrator. Knowing what needs to be omitted from a dehydrator is just as important as understanding how to use it properly. Let's take a look at what cannot be put in a dehydrator, so you can make the most out of your dehydrator.

There are several categories of food, items and other things you should avoid placing in your dehydrator. The first category has to do with food safety - under no circumstances should any cooked foods, dairy, cream-based sauces, eggs or any raw meat or poultry be dehydrated. These may contain harmful bacteria that can linger past the dehydration process, resulting in illness. This includes things like jerky, which is usually made from meat. Instead of dehydrating your own jerky at home, buy the pre-made and pre-safe kind from the store.

Second, fatty, oily foods such as chips, french fries and nuts are unsuitable for top-down dehydration. The fats in these types of food will cause them to stick to the trays and slowly bake, which can ruin the flavor and texture and any nutritional value the items may have had. 

Third, foods with a high sugar content such as dried fruits, and meat marinades act best when air-dried, not in a dehydrator. The heat from the dehydrator will caramelize the sugar and make it nearly impossible to eat. 

Fourth and finally, certain other things you may think about dehydrating, such as rubber bands, sponges and wet clothing, are not ideal for a food-grade appliance and may cause a safety hazard, due to the motor running for long periods of time. 

In summary, when it comes to dehydrating food in your home, there are some items that you should never put in your dehydrator. These are cooked food, dairy, cream-based sauces, eggs, raw meat or poultry, fatty or oily foods, items with high sugar content, and rubber bands, sponges and wet clothing. Knowing what not to put in your dehydrator can help you make the most of your dehydrator and know that you are getting the most out of your food.
