## What is the Meaning of the Circle Laundry Symbol?

The iconic circle laundry symbol features on all of our clothing labels, from underwear, to jeans, to shirts and all other garments. This symbol provides the consumer with a key bit of information on the recommended wash instructions for the garment. But there is more to it than just ‘wash x times with x temperature water’. To understand how to take proper care of each item of clothing, it pays to understand the different symbols associated with them. 

The circle laundry symbol is divided into three parts, with each part representing a different symbol. The first is a number, or numbers, which indicates maximum washer temperature, usually in degrees celsius. The second is usually a letter, signifying the action to take with the garment.

From the letter 'X' which is likely to be something indicating 'Do not Wash', to 'S' for 'Don't be Spun', the instructions for each item vary significantly. The third component is a bar below the number and letter, signifying the type of bleaching the garment can tolerate; from 'Do Not Bleach' to mild or even chlorine bleach, it could be any one of these.

To properly determine the meaning of a garment label’s circle laundry symbol, it is important to look up each component separately. Furthermore, if the garment does not have a circle symbol, then other symbols, such as for dry cleaning, may be present. It is always best to take extra care that the care instructions are followed correctly, as this ultimately helps preserve the quality of the garments.

In conclusion, while the circle laundry symbol is a familiar presence on our clothing labels, it is important to take the time to understand what each component of the symbol is communicating, as this is key to properly caring for each item of clothing.
