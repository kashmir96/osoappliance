Air Conditioning Options For Renters 
When temperatures start soaring during summer months having access air conditioning become essential especially renters living within hot climates; thankfully now days there numerous air conditioning options available ranging from portable units through window mounted split systems right up full central air conditioning setups… Here look few popular air con choices typically found amongst renters: 

Portable Air Conditioning Units– These small portable AC units usually fit windowsills offering cooling capacities usually between 5kW right up 15kW depending model chosen; these typically stand alone devices plug directly into power outlets hence no extra labour setup required apart positioning correctly within tenants desired locations e.,g bedrooms living rooms office spaces etc.. Portable AC devices usually come equipped timer functions allowing users set automatic turn off times following preset intervals helping conserve energy while user away home… Also keep mind most portable AC devices don't come built-in dehumidifying functionality unlike window mounted split systems described below thus individual humidity regulation settings cannot achieved via portable AC unit itself instead user need manually adjust humidity levels via humidifier device separate standalone unit…

Window Mounted Split Systems – These units consist outdoor compressor unit connected indoor fan coil installed within window frame; these offer more cooling capacities compared portable AC units typically ranging between 8kW right up 22kW depending chosen model plus come built-in dehumidifying functionality allowing users regulate humidity levels within living environment… Installation process involves some labour component since need drill holes connect compressor unit outside while running copper piping & electrical cables through wall connecting fan coil inside thus installation costs usually higher compared portable AC units though paying off terms energy savings since split systems usually much more efficient compared standard portable units… 

Central Air Conditioning – Central air conditioning systems offer ultimate cooling solution providing whole house cooling capabilities without hassle installing individual air conditioning devices each room; these large complex systems involve extensive installation processes involving running ductwork throughout entire home connecting centralised compressor/condenser located outside premises while wiring up thermostats within each room allowing user control temperatures separately from single location… Due complexity installation costs associated with central air con systems usually quite high however long term benefits often outweigh initial setup expenses terms energy efficiency & convenience provided by such system including ability monitor entire houses temperatures simultaneously from single location something impossible achieve via individual AC devices described above… 

Overall renters have lot choices when comes air con setups ranging simple plug-n-play portable AC devices through complex full blown centralised installations; though cost wise each type varies greatly its worth researching into options further before deciding which type suits best tenants desired requirements both short term & long term basis…
