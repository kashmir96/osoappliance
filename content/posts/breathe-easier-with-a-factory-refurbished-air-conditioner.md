## Refreshed Air Conditioners For Easier Breathing
Are you in need of a new air conditioner? Have you considered a factory-refurbished air conditioner? Purchasing a factory-refurbished air conditioner offers many of the same benefits that a new air conditioner has to offer, while also saving you money. 

One of the primary benefits that many household appliance users appreciate when purchasing a factory-refurbished air conditioner is that they can be purchased directly from the manufacturer. This means that if there is an issue at any point with your new air conditioner, you can contact the original manufacturer for help. Manufacturers are typically very helpful when dealing with factory-refurbished models, and the customer support experience is generally better than with non-refurbished models.

Factory-refurbished air conditioners are usually inspected, tested and certified by the manufacturer prior to being sold. This means that the air conditioner is backed by the same warranty and protection that a new unit would have. This gives the user added confidence that the unit will continue to perform as expected for the life of the warranty. And, depending on the model you buy and the company you purchase it from, some factory-refurbished models may offer warranty extensions of up to five years in some cases. 

Factory-refurbished air conditioners are typically a great choice for households that donâ€™t want to spend the extra money that is required for a brand-new unit. Refurbished air conditioners provide users with the peace of mind that comes from the knowledge that their unit has been throughly inspected and tested by the manufacturer, and comes with a similar warranty protection program as a new unit. 

When it comes time to have your factory-refurbished air conditioner serviced, be sure to hire a professional who is licensed and qualified to handle the job.
