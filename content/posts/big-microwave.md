When you think of microwaves, the first thing that comes to mind is usually convenience. After all, who doesn’t love being able to heat up a meal in minutes? But when it comes to buying a microwave, not all models are equal. While there are plenty of small microwaves out there designed for apartments and dorms, there’s also something to be said for investing in a big microwave.

Big microwaves provide more cooking space than their smaller counterparts, making them perfect for families or households with multiple members. For example, if you need to cook several dishes at once — say two casseroles and some popcorn — then having the extra countertop space that a bigger microwave provides will make things much easier. Plus, many larger models come with built-in convection settings which provide added versatility (think toast and bake).

Another advantage of big microwaves is that they tend to have more power output than smaller ones. This means they can reheat food faster and more evenly than their smaller counterparts – great if you’re looking for quick meal solutions on busy evenings or if you have guests coming over who need dinner right away! Additionally, because higher wattage models tend to cost more money up front than lower wattage ones, they often last longer too – saving money in the long run by reducing the need for frequent repairs or replacements. 

Finally, many people find large microwaves more aesthetically pleasing than smaller ones – especially when installed above an oven or range as part of an integrated kitchen suite. Not only does this create a cohesive look throughout your kitchen but it also puts your microwave within easy reach while still keeping it out of sight when not in use! 

In summary: If you’re looking for versatility and convenience in your kitchen then investing in a big microwave is definitely worth considering! With their larger cooking capacity and higher power output they offer an easy way to prepare meals quickly while still providing plenty of style points too!
