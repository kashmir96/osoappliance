If your refrigerator is making strange noises, it can be a bit worrying. However, if your fridge is making noise when the door is closed, then you may not need to call a repair service just yet. In this blog post, we’ll explain why fridges sometimes make noise when the door is closed and some ways in which you can attempt to fix it yourself before reaching out for professional help. 

When fridges make noise when the door is closed it’s usually caused by one of two things; either something inside the fridge or freezer has shifted and come in contact with something else or the gasket around the door isn’t sealing properly. 

The first thing you should try to do if your fridge makes a noise when the door closes is to open up and check that nothing inside has shifted or fallen over. If something has come in contact with another object then shift it so that they no longer touch each other. Additionally, check that any drawers or shelves are snapped into place correctly and none of them are loose as they could potentially cause noise too. If everything looks ok inside then check that none of the food items have gotten stuck behind or underneath any of them as this could also be what's causing a rattling sound when closing. 

The second thing you should look at if your fridge makes a sound at closing time is whether there's an issue with its gasket sealer (the rubber piece around where the doors close). Over time these rubber seals can become worn out from being opened and closed many times daily so try inspecting them closely for anything unusual such as tears, discolouration etc… It may even be possible that food particles have got stuck between them which could also lead to noise production when closing after all that excess air comes whistling through! If you find any issues with these seals then replace them immediately - most hardware stores will supply new ones cheaply so this shouldn't be too much of an expense overall! 

If neither of these solutions solve your issue then it's probably worthwhile contacting a professional repair service who will likely take care of whatever underlying problem there might be causing all this unwanted noise creation!
