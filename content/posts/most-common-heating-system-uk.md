Heating systems are an important part of life in the United Kingdom. With its chilly climate, it’s essential to keep homes and commercial buildings warm during the winter months. The most common heating systems used in the UK include central heating, storage heaters, electric radiators, and air source heat pumps.

Central Heating is the most popular type of heating system found in UK homes and businesses. Central heating consists of a boiler that heats water which is then pumped around your home or business through pipes to radiators or underfloor heating systems; providing warm air throughout your property. It is an efficient way to heat large spaces as it distributes warmth evenly. 

Storage Heaters are electric heaters that store up energy during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower and use that energy when needed during peak hours when electricity rates are higher; saving you money on your energy bills. There are two types of storage heater: convection (which uses fan-assisted convection currents) and radiant (which uses infra-red radiation). Storage heaters can be beneficial for people who don’t want to pay for central heating installation but want a reliable source of heated air in their home or business environment. 

Electric Radiators are a more modern form of electrical heater which use electricity as their primary power source rather than gas and oil like traditional radiators do; making them much more efficient than traditional ones as well as being more cost effective over time due to their lower running costs. Electric radiators come in many different shapes and sizes so they can fit into almost any space either on the wall or free standing depending on your needs; aiding you with tailoring it towards your own personal preferences while also helping you save money on energy bills due to their efficiency levels compared with other electric heating solutions out there on the market today such as electric fires & portable gas fires etc… 

Air Source Heat Pumps use renewable energy from outside air temperatures to generate warm air inside buildings instead of using fossil fuels like natural gas or oil for example which can be expensive over time due to rising prices year after year; making them a great solution for those wanting an eco friendly alternative with long term savings benefits too! Air source pumps require less maintenance than other types of heating systems but can be noisy if not installed correctly so make sure you get advice from an experienced installer before committing if you decide this is right for you! 

Overall, all these systems have pros & cons depending on what kind of property they’re being installed into - so make sure you do some research beforehand before deciding which one would best suit your needs!
