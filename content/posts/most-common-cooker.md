Cooking is one of the most enjoyable activities, but it can also be very dangerous if proper safety procedures are not followed. To ensure that you and your family stay safe while cooking, it is important to follow some simple tips. Here are some of the most common cooker safety tips:


1. Always wear appropriate clothing while cooking – loose and baggy clothes can easily catch fire if they come into contact with hot surfaces or flames. Wear tight-fitting clothes when handling hot items and tie back long hair to keep it from getting caught in the stovetop or oven elements. 

2. Ensure a clear workspace when cooking – clutter in the kitchen can increase the risk of a fire starting or someone accidentally bumping into something hot on their way around the kitchen. Make sure counters and floors are kept clean, as well as any cookware that you may be using during your meal prep. 

3. Keep flammable materials away from heat sources – this includes towels, pot holders, wooden spoons or any other materials that may catch fire easily if exposed to high temperatures for too long. Be sure to store all flammable materials out of reach, away from the stovetop or oven elements when not in use so that they don’t become a hazard while you’re cooking. 

4. Never leave cooking food unattended – even just a few seconds away from what you’re cooking could lead to an accident occurring due to burning food or grease splattering onto nearby surfaces or people nearby accidentally touching something hot on their way past your kitchen space! Always stay close by so that you can keep an eye on what is going on inside your kitchen at all times when preparing meals for yourself and others in your home! 

5. Always read labels carefully before using any product– many products used for cleaning contain chemicals which are hazardous if inhaled during use near a gas cooker . Read labels carefully before using any cleaning agents near open flames and never spray them directly onto an open flame! Finally , make sure all gas connections have been securely tightened before lighting up your cookers . Loose connections pose serious risks including fires , explosions , carbon monoxide poisoning etc !
