Using a dryer without a dryer vent is not recommended and is not safe. A dryer vent is an essential part of the dryer system, as it helps to vent out hot air and moisture from the dryer. Without a dryer vent, the hot air and moisture will build up inside the dryer, creating a dangerous situation. This buildup of hot air and moisture can cause the dryer to overheat and even catch fire.

In addition to the safety concerns, using a dryer without a dryer vent will also reduce the efficiency of the dryer. Without a vent, the hot air and moisture will not be able to escape, resulting in the dryer taking longer to dry clothes. This will also increase the energy costs associated with running the dryer.

If you do not have a dryer vent, the best option is to install one. Installing a dryer vent is relatively easy and can be done by most homeowners. It is important to make sure that the vent is properly installed and that it is vented to the outside of the house. This will ensure that the hot air and moisture are properly vented out of the house and away from the dryer.

In conclusion, using a dryer without a dryer vent is not recommended and is not safe. Installing a dryer vent is the best option to ensure the safety of your home and the efficiency of your dryer.
