Air conditioning is a major convenience in modern life, but unfortunately, it can also be unhealthy if not used properly. While air conditioning can reduce indoor temperatures and improve air quality, it can also cause problems such as dehydration, allergies, and asthma.

The primary health issue related to air conditioning is dehydration. Air conditioners remove humidity from the air which can lead to dry skin and eyes which makes the body more susceptible to infection and illness. To combat this problem, it’s important to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.

Additionally, many people suffer from allergies or asthma that are exacerbated by air conditioning systems. Air conditioners often trap dust particles in their filters which can be irritating for those with respiratory issues. It’s important to regularly clean your air conditioner’s filters or even replace them altogether if symptoms don’t subside quickly enough.

Lastly, while air conditioning units may help reduce indoor temperatures on hot summer days they can also cause a sudden drop in temperature that leads some people feeling cold or uncomfortable at night time if they are not prepared for it. As such it's important to ensure that any sudden changes in temperature are gradual so as not to shock one's body into an uncomfortable state of being too quickly. 

In conclusion, while air conditioning is essential during hot summer months it is important to understand how its use affects one's health and well-being so as not to suffer any unwanted side-effects from its use over time. Be sure to stay hydrated throughout the day and regularly clean your unit's filters so as not suffer from any ill effects due its use!
