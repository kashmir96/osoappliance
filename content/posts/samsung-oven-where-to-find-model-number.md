If you’re looking for the model number of your Samsung oven, you’ve come to the right place! The model number of your oven is an important piece of information that can help you identify the type and size of your oven, as well as its features and capabilities. Knowing this information can help you find compatible parts and accessories, troubleshoot issues, and even determine if a particular appliance is right for you.

The model number of your Samsung oven can be found in several places. The most common location is on the back or side of the appliance, usually near the power cord or on a rating plate. It may also be printed inside the door frame or on the interior wall. If you’re having trouble locating it, consult your owner’s manual for more specific instructions.

Once you’ve located the model number, it should be easy to identify. It will typically start with “RF” followed by a series of numbers and letters that identify the type and size of your oven. For example, an RF28HMEDBSR/AA indicates that this is a 28-cubic-foot French Door refrigerator with an Energy Star rating.

Knowing your Samsung oven’s model number can save you time and hassle when it comes to shopping for compatible parts and accessories or troubleshooting any issues that may arise. It can also help ensure that you purchase an appliance that meets all of your needs and fits into your budget. We hope this blog has been helpful in helping you locate your Samsung oven’s model number!
