## The Startling Risk Associated with Residential Electricity
Electricity is an extremely helpful and beneficial resource, providing us with efficient power for all devices, electronics, appliances, and other powered accessories â€“ and when used properly, it is mostly safe. That's not to say there aren't dangers associated with electricity at home, though; understanding what those are is your first line of defense against shock, injury, or worse.

First off, it's important to remember that electricity is a kind of energy, and energy can be released in a variety of ways. It can be seen in the heat of an appliance, the light of a lightbulb, and even in an electrical shock. Electrical shocks are a direct result of the electric current that travels through the wires connecting the power source to the appliance, device, or outlet. These currents exist because electrical circuits are in a state of imbalance, and static electricity is a perfect example of such an imbalance.

The danger presents itself in a few forms. Electrical shocks can lead to burns, or worse, electrocution, which can be fatal. And when paired with water, the potential for electrocution rises exponentially. As water is a great conductor, it can allow for the electric current to pass through it much more easily than air, which increases the potential for shock or electrocution.

In addition to the potential for shocks, there are a variety of other fire hazards that are associated with electricity. Faulty wiring or appliances plugged into outlets that are overloaded with energy can both lead to fires. It's important to take precautions like having a licensed electrician replace old wiring, or understanding the output power of each outlet in order to prevent such problems.

Ultimately, safety is the number one priority when it comes to using electricity, and using commonsense is the best first step. Understanding the output power of each outlet, using caution with water, ensuring your wiring is up to date, and using safety goggles while working on electronics are all essential precautions.

It goes without saying that electricity is indispensable, but it is also important to understand the hazards associated with it. Understanding the dangers of electricity at home and taking the necessary precautions is the best way to ensure a safe and enjoyable residential experience.
