## Troubleshooting Whirlpool Top-Loading Washing Machine Error Codes
Having a problem with your Whirlpool top-loading washing machine? Washing machine error codes are one of the ways that this common appliance can indicate when something isn’t quite right. Knowing what to do when you encounter an error code can help you to get your machine working and get your laundry clean again. 

Some Whirlpool washing machines come with a display panel that can provide you with helpful information. If your machine has a display, the fault code will be displayed in the form of a flashing letter and number combination. For example, an F21 fault code could signify an issue with the water draining from the machine. 

There are also washing machine models that don’t feature a display. Error codes are still shown, although you will need to press a combination of buttons on the control panel to get the code to appear. 

If your washing machine is showing an error code, the best thing to do is consult the manual. Your manual will outline what the different codes mean and what to do if one of these codes appears. Some codes can be fixed easily, such as a minor adjustment to the load, while others require attention from a qualified service technician.

Most washing machine faults can be resolved relatively easily. However, if you’re having trouble understanding or resolving the error code shown, we recommend seeking expert help or advice. You can use our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary, which outlines the most common codes and what action you can take to resolve them.
