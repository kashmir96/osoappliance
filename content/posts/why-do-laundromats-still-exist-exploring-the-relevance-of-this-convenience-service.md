## Exploring the Ongoing Relevance of Laundromats and their Convenient Services
It’s been around since the 1950s, yet laundromats are still a staple in towns, cities, and neighborhoods. Despite the emergence of washing machines and dryers in the home, these convenient self-service laundries remain ever-present providing a valuable service. In this blog piece we'll explore why these facilities still exist and why their convenience services continue to hold relevance. 

A major factor in the continued relevance of laundromats is the fact that many households still lack their own washing machine and dryer. According to a recent survey from the Joint Center for Housing Studies, only 82% of households had their own washing machine, with that ratio being even lower in lower-income households. The prices for laundry appliances aren’t always feasible for people who are on a tight budget, but laundromats offer a more affordable alternative. 

Another major draw for those without their own laundry appliances is the efficiency factor. It may be surprising, but even in households with their own machines, 45% of laundry is still done at a shared laundry facility. This is largely due to the fact that a laundromat can be more than twice as fast as a household washing machine. With multiple spinning cycles and high velocity speeds, these industrial-grade washers and dryers can reduce the time of a wash to far shorter than the two or three hours that it can take in the home.

Yet beyond the price and efficiency, laundromats are still popular because of their convenience. Many of the amenities associated with these self-service laundries include free Wi-Fi in the waiting area, snack and drink vending machines, directories of local laundromats, and interactive videos and games during the wait. With all of these features, waiting for the laundry isn’t so much a chore, but a form of relaxation. 

At the end of the day, the popularity of laundromats is a testament to the need for convenience in our everyday lives. As households continue to find it difficult to purchase washing machines and dryers on the limited budget, or simply prefer the efficiency of external services, the relevance of laundromats continues to remain. So for those who are in the market for a laundry appliance rental solution, our [List of Appliance Rental Companies](./pages/appliance-rental) offers a convenient way to find the perfect machine to rent.
