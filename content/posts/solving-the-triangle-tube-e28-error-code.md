## Solving the Triangle Tube E28 Error 

If you've recently been presented with a Triangle Tube E28 Error Code, you might be wondering what this problem is and how you can solve it. This error can be quite a nuisance and is typically caused by a faulty component or incorrect setup. Fortunately, this guide will help you understand why this error is occurring and what you can do to fix it. 

The Triangle Tube E28 Error code is a common fault code that appears when the temperature in the boiler has exceeded the maximum limit. This usually occurs when the water temperature has climbed too high and the boiler has shut itself off to prevent any further damage. To solve this error code, you can either reduce the water temperature by changing the setting or making sure that the pumps are running without obstruction. Additionally, you may need to check the water pressure level of your boiler as too much or too little can also contribute to this problem.

If the above steps do not solve the error code, it may be necessary to check other components. Such components may include circulator pumps that are not working correctly or the air filter, orifice assembly, or safety pressure switch. It is important to perform a thorough inspection of all components to locate any potential problems. Once any faulty parts have been identified and replaced, the issue should resolve itself. 

In some cases, the Triangle Tube Error Code (E28) may also be caused by bad wiring or faulty thermistors. If this is the case, a qualified appliance technician should be called in to identify the issue and fix it accordingly. 

Finally, it is possible that the issue is caused by a faulty control board. In this case, the board will need to be repaired or replaced to solve the problem. If you do not have the technical expertise to fix the problem, it is highly recommended that you reach out to an appliance repair technician.

Solving a Triangle Tube E28 Error Code can be a challenge, but with the right steps, it is a problem that can quickly be resolved.
