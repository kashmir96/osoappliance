## Diagnosing e23 Error Code on Bosch Dishwashers

Many Bosch dishwashers are equipped with innovative technology that helps diagnose and prevent appliance problems. One common issue encountered is an e23 error code which indicates a problem with the drain cycle. Although it can be intimidating to face appliance problems, this error code is easy enough to troubleshoot and fix.

If your Bosch dishwasher is displaying an e23 error code, start by checking the drain hose to make sure it is installed properly. If the hose has become dislodged or misaligned, it could be causing the issue. On certain models, the error code can be cleared by pushing the Start/Reset button. If not, the drainage system will need to be checked for clogs or other obstructions.

Another step you can take is to run a diagnostic test using the dishwasher keys. If the test does not fix the problem, it may be necessary to turn the power off to the dishwasher for 15 minutes in order to reset the system.

If none of these steps help, a professional appliance technician should be called in to assess the situation. A technician is able to diagnose the problem with the necessary expertise and can repair whatever is keeping the dishwasher from working properly.

Troubleshooting an e23 error code on a Bosch dishwasher can be easy or more complicated depending on the underlying cause. If the steps above do not solve the issue, seeking help from an experienced appliance repair technician is the next best option.
