Making popcorn on the stove is a great way to enjoy a tasty, homemade snack. It’s also an inexpensive and easy way to make popcorn without the need for an air popper or microwave. All you need is popcorn kernels, oil, and a pot with a lid. Here’s how to make delicious stovetop popcorn in just minutes:

1. Start by heating some oil in the bottom of your pot over medium-high heat. Use enough oil to cover the bottom of your pot but not so much that it will overflow when you add the kernels.

2. Once the oil is hot, add your popcorn kernels in an even layer on top of the oil and replace the lid on your pot. Shake it gently every few seconds to help evenly distribute heat throughout all of the kernels as they pop.

3. Keep shaking until you hear popping slowing down (about 3-4 minutes). Once that happens, turn off the heat and let sit for another 30 seconds or so before removing from heat completely and pouring into a bowl or serving dish.

4. Sprinkle with salt or seasonings of your choice and enjoy! 

 Stovetop popcorn has been around for centuries because it’s such an easy way to make delicious snacks at home without needing any special equipment or ingredients (other than what you already have). Plus, you can control exactly how much salt and other seasonings go into each batch so that everyone can have their own perfect snack! Give it a try today!
