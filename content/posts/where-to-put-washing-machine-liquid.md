If you’re wondering where to put washing machine liquid detergent, the answer is simple: it depends on your washing machine. Some machines use a special detergent dispenser, while others require you to add the detergent directly into the drum. 

For machines with a built-in detergent dispenser, simply pour the liquid detergent into the designated compartment and close it. The dispenser will dispense the right amount of detergent during each cycle, so you don’t have to worry about measuring it out each time. 

If your machine does not have a built-in dispenser, you will need to add the liquid detergent directly into the drum before starting a cycle. To do this, open up your washing machine and pour in the recommended amount of liquid detergent (check your owner’s manual for more information). Once it is added, close up your washing machine and select your desired cycle. 

When using liquid detergents in either type of washer, make sure that you store them properly after use. Detergents can be corrosive if left in direct sunlight or exposed to high temperatures for long periods of time, so try to keep them away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight when not in use. 

By following these steps and using the correct amount of liquid detergent for each load, you can ensure that your clothes come out clean and smelling fresh every time!
