With the rise of the popularity of sous vide cooking in recent years, it is important to be aware of the potential safety risks associated with the process. In this blog, we will explore the dangers of sous vide cooking and provide some insight into how to protect oneself.

In sous vide cooking, food is placed in a sealed plastic pouch and heated in a circulating water bath. This heating process warms the food to very precise temperatures that have been calculated based on the ingredients’ texture, acidity, and temperature. The temperature range of this process can range anywhere from 60 degrees Celcius to 130 degrees Celcius, leaving the food cooked to perfection.

Although this precise temperature control can provide consistent results, it requires utmost precision to be safe. In particular, failure to maintain water temperatures around the recommended range can be hazardous as nutrient-dense foods can turn into a ”cooking bath” for some harmful bacteria to grow, such as botulism. Furthermore, plastic bags used in sous-vide cooking can sometimes leak small amounts of plastic into the food, introducing additional potential risks.

In light of these potential dangers, There are several measures that can be taken to reduce one’s risk when using sous vide cooking. Firstly, it is important to be aware of what temperatures are safe for the foods being cooked and to consistently maintain the water temperature throughout the cooking process. Secondly, it is important to use quality plastic bags that are labeled safe for use in sous-vide or boiling water temperatures. These precautions can help to reduce exposure to harmful bacteria and contaminants.

To conclude, sous vide cooking is a great way to bring precision and consistency to meals, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with the process. Taking the necessary safety measures, such as maintaining safe temperatures and using quality bags, can help to reduce exposure to dangerous bacteria and other contaminants. If you are ever in doubt of the safety of your food or appliances, be sure to consult a qualified [Appliance Repair Technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for help and assistance.

## What is Sous Vide Cooking?
Sous Vide cooking is a method of cooking vacuum-sealed ingredients in a temperature-controlled water bath. This method allows for more even and consistent cooking than other cooking methods and helps to preserve delicate vitamins and nutrients in food.

## What are the Risks of Sous Vide Cooking?
There are several risks associated with sous vide cooking, including:
- Potential foodborne illnesses due to undercooking meats and poultry when sous vide cooking at low temperatures.
- Risk of contamination, as submerging food in a water bath risks coming in contact with outside substances.
- Plastic Bags Used for Sous Vide Cooking are not microwave safe, and can be a source of toxins in food.
- Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) may be produced when plastics are heated.

## Is Sous Vide Cooking Safe?
Sous Vide cooking can be a safe and healthy cooking method if done correctly, however, it is important to follow health and safety guidelines. Make sure to use the correct type of plastic bag for sous vide cooking and ensure that the product is intended for sous vide methods. Make sure to heat food to the correct internal temperature and ensure that food safety and hygiene standards are maintained throughout the process. Pay special attention when using low temperatures for long periods of time.

## What Precautions Should I Take when Sous Vide Cooking?
When sous vide cooking, there are certain precautions you should take to ensure safe and healthy cooking:
- Cook food to recommended internal temperatures.
- Remove food from the water bath once it has achieved the desired internal temperature.
- Disinfect surfaces and utensils before use.
- Ensure the vacuum-seal bags and the water bath are free of dirt or debris.
- Do not use plastic bags or containers used for sous vide cooking in microwave ovens.
- Monitor food while cooking and stir the water bath occasionally.

## How Long Can I Store Foods Cooked with Sous Vide?
Food cooked with sous vide can typically be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days when properly sealed. Make sure to cool down cooked sous vide dishes before refrigerating and ensure the area where it is stored is clean. If properly sealed and stored, food cooked with sous vide can be kept for longer periods of time.

## Key Takeaways for Cooking with Sous Vide

Sous vide cooking requires precise temperatures, ranging from 60 to 130 Celcius, to ensure safety. If temperatures are not maintained, there is an increased risk of bacterial growth and leaking of plastic into the food. To accurately utilize sous vide cooking, you should be aware of what temperatures are safe to use and opt for quality plastic bags labeled safe for that temperature. Lastly, consult a qualified Appliance Repair Technician if you are unsure of the safety of your food or appliances.
