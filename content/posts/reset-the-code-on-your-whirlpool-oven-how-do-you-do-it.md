## Resetting the Code on a Whirlpool Oven
Most Whirlpool ovens have an electronic, programmable control panel that allows you to set the oven to your exact specifications. The oven will also display error codes when something goes wrong. If you’re getting an error code, your first step is to identify the code and figure out what it means. Knowing what the code means will help you determine what needs to be done to reset or fix the problem.

To help you identify any error codes, Whirlpool provides a comprehensive list of error codes and what they mean. If the code you are seeing is not listed, you should call a professional for help.

To reset the code, start by turning off the power to the oven. Wait 30 minutes and turn on the power again. This should reset the code and the oven should begin working properly. If you continue to get an error code, you may need to reset the oven manually. To do this, you should consult the user’s manual or the Whirlpool website for instructions on how to do a manual reset.

If the problem continues, it might be necessary to replace certain components, such as the control board, wiring, or sensors. In this case, you should always hire a qualified technician.

In conclusion, error codes on Whirlpool ovens can be reset in two ways, either manual or by power cycling the oven. If all fails, you should consult a qualified technician to help you diagnose and fix the problem. If you need help identifying the code that's showing on your oven, make sure to refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for more information.
