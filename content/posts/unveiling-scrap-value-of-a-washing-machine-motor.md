## Uncovering What a Washing Machine Motor is Worth at Scrap

When getting a washing machine fixed, you might be asking how much an old motor is worth if you decide to scrap it. This is a fair question to ask, as the scrap value of a washing machine motor can vary drastically depending on the type and age of the washing machine. This article will uncover what factors to consider when determining the scrap value of a washing machine motor.

First, it is important to understand the type of washing machine being discarded. Different makes and models have different scrap values, as metal components vary between models. For example, some parts may have copper wiring or copper components, which could influence the scrap value more than parts with aluminum wiring or components. 

The age and condition of the washing machine motor is also an important factor in determining scrap value. If the motor is in good condition without any wear and tear, it is likely to be worth more than a motor with visible signs of age. Issues with the motor, such as smoke or burning smells, will reduce the scrap value even further.

The last major factor to consider is the part itself. Certain parts of the motor, such as steel or brass, will have higher scrap value than plastic or aluminum. Additionally, the size of the motor can affect the scrap value, as larger motors are worth more than smaller motors.

The scrap value of a washing machine motor will vary depending on multiple factors, including the type, age, and condition of the machine, and the parts and size of the motor. Understanding these factors can help you determine how much a motor is worth at scrap.

If you have an old washing machine that needs repairs, you don't have to scrap it for parts. Instead, check out our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to find someone who can help you quickly and efficiently.
