## Don't Panic When You Get an FD Error Code on Your Midea Washer

Are you a proud owner of a Midea washer, only to find that the error code FD has been displayed on the machine? Before you panic, this error is unfortunately pretty common - and can usually be fixed very easily. Here is what you need to know about solving the FD error code on your Midea washer.

The FD error code that your Midea washer is displaying is an indication of a water level issue. The FD stands for a “Failed Draining” error, indicating that the machine is not draining the water properly. This is typically caused when the machine isn’t able to drain the water during the cycle due to a hose being blocked. 

The solution here is simple: use a rubber plug to unclog the hose, if your machine has one. Or, if you are able to, disconnect the hose altogether, and clean the outside to make sure it is free from any dirt of debris that is prevented the water from draining. 

Once your washer is able to successfully drain the water, the FD error code should be gone and you can continue using the machine without issue.
