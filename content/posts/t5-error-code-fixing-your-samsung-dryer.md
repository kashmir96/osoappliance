## Fixing a Samsung Dryer's T5 Error

If your Samsung dryer is displaying an error code that says T5, it is not something you want to ignore. This code indicates a problem with the conveyor motor that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. To help you get your dryer back up and running again, we'll go over why this code is happening and the steps you can take to fix it.

Before you begin troubleshooting, make sure the dryer is in a safe place, clear of any combustible materials, and turn off all power to the unit. This will help prevent shock or fire hazards while you are working on it. Once you're safe, take a look at the power cord and make sure it is properly plugged into a grounded outlet.

Next, you'll want to check the dryer's air duct. Make sure that it is free of lint buildup and obstructions. If there is lint or an obstruction in the way, remove it and ensure the airway is clear. If the air duct is free and clear, you'll want to move on to the conveyor motor.

The conveyor motor should be checked for debris and buildup. Proceed by unhooking the dryer's conveyor belt and cleaning out the interior area. Look for any components that may have come loose or have malfunctioned. If you hear any abnormal noises or spot any damage, contact a professional who is experienced in Samsung dryer repair.

If no damage is found and the air duct and conveyor motor are all in good working order, the last step is to re-check the power connection. Make sure the power cord is securely connected and that it is plugged into an appropriate outlet.

In the end, a T5 error code indicates a problem with the conveyor motor, so it is important to make sure it is in good working order. The steps above will help keep your Samsung dryer up-and-running for many more years. But if you still experience problems, make sure to refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/).
