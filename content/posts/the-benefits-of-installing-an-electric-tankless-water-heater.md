## Advantages of Electric Tankless Water Heaters

Electric tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular for homeowners due to their numerous benefits. They offer many advantages over traditional storage tank water heaters. They are space saving, energy efficient, and can provide a continuous supply of hot water on demand. In this blog post, we will review the advantages of electric tankless water heaters and discuss why they may be the best option for your home.

Electric tankless water heaters are highly efficient and can provide a continuous supply of hot water on demand. This is different from traditional storage tank water heaters that often require heating cycles to maintain a constant temperature. With a tankless water heater, the water is heated on demand and no energy is wasted on heating and reheating water that is not in use. Additionally, tankless water heaters save space by hanging on a wall or mounting in a closet. Because of their small size, they require less space than traditional water heaters and can be used in smaller homes or apartments where space is limited.

Another advantage of electric tankless water heaters is their energy efficiency. Tankless water heaters can save households hundreds of dollars on their energy bills by using less energy than storage tank water heaters. Additionally, electric tankless water heaters are more environmentally friendly than traditional water heaters because they produce less carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy used.

Finally, electric tankless water heaters are relatively low maintenance and can last for up to 20 years. They donâ€™t require regular flushes or water filter replacements like storage tank water heaters do and their service costs are typically lower. 

In conclusion, electric tankless water heaters are a great option for those looking to save space, energy, and money. If you are considering upgrading your water heater, be sure to check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to find the best option for your home.
