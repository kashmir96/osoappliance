Steam washing machines have recently become a popular choice in the laundry room, and for good reason. With their ability to save time, reduce wrinkles, and even kill bacteria, it's easy to see why they have caught on so quickly. However, steam washing machines also have some drawbacks that you should be aware of before investing in one. In this blog post, weâ€™ll look at the pros and cons of steam washing machines so you can decide if one is right for your family.

Pros: 
First and foremost, steam washing machines are incredibly efficient when it comes to saving time. By combining the power of heat and water with detergent or fabric softener, clothes come out clean in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional methods. Steam also helps reduce wrinkles in fabrics since clothes don't get as wet or agitated during the cycle. Not only does this mean less ironing for you but also helps preserve the fabric's integrity over time. Finally, some evidence suggests that steam may even help kill bacteria that could be lingering on clothing after a regular cycle has been completed. 

Cons: 
Unfortunately, steam can be tough on more delicate fabrics like wool or silk since it can cause shrinkage due to its high temperatures. Additionally, compared to traditional washers with an agitator design that can handle larger loads at once, most steam washers are front-loaders which may not be ideal if you have a large family or lots of laundry to do at once. Finally, while they are typically energy efficient when used properly - meaning lower water temperatures and shorter cycles - they tend to cost more upfront than other washers do. 

Overall though if used correctly and with care given to certain fabrics types like wool or silk then steam washing machines can certainly offer a lot of benefits when it comes to saving time while getting your clothes cleaner than ever before!
