## Reset Your Washing Machine for a Smooth Running

If you own a Washing Machine, you'll likely come to a point when the machine begins to malfunction, leaving you with a load of wet clothes and a broken machine. Fortunately, there is a quick and easy way for you to reset your Washing Machine, providing it with the jumpstart it often needs to get back up and running smoothly.

To force a reset on your Washing Machine, begin by unplugging the machine from power. This will give your Washing Machine a complete power loss, so ensure all of the laundry inside is out of the machine before you proceed. If necessary, you can open the water valves to cool the water down inside the machine.

Next, locate the coin-sized release plug on the side of the washing machine, typically located next to the control panel. With a small instrument such as a fork or a paperclip, poke into the recess of the plug and deliver a light amount of pressure on its sides. This will cause the plug to rise and release the tension from the reset switch, thereby forcing a reset of the washing machine. Once you've completed the reset, plug the washing machine back into power and begin running a new cycle.

By performing a reset of your washing machine, you're able to give it the jumpstart it needs to produce the perfect loads of laundry you expect.
