## Resetting Your Espresso Maker: How to Do It 
When a problem arises with your espresso maker, you may be tempted to throw up your hands and order a new espresso appliance right away. However, there is no need to do so just yet, as you may be able to reset the appliance and return it to full functionality. Resetting an espresso appliance requires a few simple steps and no special tools.

To begin, you must unplug your espresso machine from the outlet and wait until the appliances turns off completely. This may take a few minutes, so it is best to wait until the appliance has completely cooled down before proceeding. Once the espresso appliance has cooled down, you are ready to reset the appliance.

To reset, press and hold the ‘mode’ or ‘program’ button for about 5 seconds, or until you hear a beep sound. Depending on the model of espresso machine you own, this could be a different button, so it is best to consult your owner’s manual. After the appliance has been reset, you can now test its functionality. If the resetting process has worked, the machine should heat up and be ready to use. 

If the appliance still does not appear to be functioning, you may need to refer to your owner’s manual for next steps. If you cannot find the manual or don’t understand the instructions listed, it is best to schedule an appointment with a professional espresso appliance technician.

Resetting an espresso appliance is a simple DIY task that can save you money and time. However, in some cases, the problem you are experiencing may be larger than what a reset can solve, requiring additional assistance.
