## Diagnosing Error Codes on Samsung Eco Bubble Washing Machines

Does your Samsung washing machine exhibit strange behavior or display error codes on its display panel? If so, it could indicate possible mechanical or electrical troubles. Fortunately, most Samsung Eco Bubble Washing Machines are designed with standardized error codes to quickly alert you to the current issue and recommend potential solutions. In this blog we will provide an overview of some common Samsung Eco Bubble Washing Machine Error Codes, so that users can troubleshoot and repair their washers in the comfort of their own homes.

The range of Samsung Eco Bubble Washing Machines makes diagnosing the error codes more complicated than with other models. Samsung normally categorizes the error codes into 4-8 categories, for example "HE” for a heating error, “De” for a drying error, or “LE” for a load imbalance error. After pinpointing the error code, it’s important to refer to your machine’s user manual for a detailed explanation of the problem and potential solutions. Some common errors can be repaired with simple steps and daily maintenance:

-HE([E1], [E2]): These Errors usually means there is an issue with the heating system. This could be an issue with the wiring or a faulty temperature sensor. Before beginning any sort of repair, be sure to unplug the washing machine.

-De ([E3], [E4]): A drying error usually occurs when the washer has detected an issue with the moisture sensor. Check the larger parts of the appliance to ensure that all of the components are properly connected and functioning.

-LE ([E5], [E6]): An LE error typically happens when there are an imbalanced amount of clothes in the load, causing the washer to become unbalanced and unable reach the desired speed. Try to evenly load the machine before restarting the cycle.

There may be times when the error code displayed is not resolved with the steps noted above. In this case, it is recommended to contact authorized Samsung service technicians for assistance in troubleshooting the error codes.

It’s important to address any errors promptly and properly, as Samsung Eco Bubble Washers are designed with energy efficient features that help keep energy bills low and extend the life of the machine.
