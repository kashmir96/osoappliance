While the exact value of each unit is different, the scrapping process is fairly straightforward. In order to make money from scrapping a central air unit, you will need to find a reputable scrapping company that pays a fair price. You will also need to be sure that you are getting the most value out of the unit by taking it apart and sorting the components into scrap metal, electrical cables, and compressors or motors.It is important to note that the scrap metal or electrical components may need to be taken to a local scrap yard for recycling. 

The cost for scrapping a central air unit will vary depending on its age, condition, and the current price of metals. Generally speaking, newer units tend to fetch a higher price than older units due to their higher metal content. Some scrap dealers will even offer to pay for the unit in cash if it is in good condition.

In addition to selling the unit for scrap, some people opt to donate their old unit to a local charity or recycling center. Although this is not as profitable, it can help the environment and provide a much-needed resource to those in need.
