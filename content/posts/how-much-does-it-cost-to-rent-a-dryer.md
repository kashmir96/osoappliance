If you're looking to save money on laundry costs, renting a dryer can be a great option. The cost of renting a dryer will vary depending on the size and type of dryer you choose, as well as the length of your rental agreement. 

Generally speaking, the average cost to rent a dryer is between $20 and $50 per month. Rent-to-own prices usually start at around $10 per week for basic models, while high-end models can run up to $100 or more per month. You may also be responsible for any delivery and installation fees that come with your rental agreement. 

When choosing the right dryer for your needs, it's important to consider energy efficiency ratings and features like steam cycles or moisture sensors that can help save time and money in the long run. It's also important to read through any rental contracts carefully before signing anything – some rentals may include hidden fees or additional charges that you weren't expecting. 

Overall, renting a dryer is an affordable alternative to buying one outright – just make sure you do your research first so that you get the best deal for your money!
