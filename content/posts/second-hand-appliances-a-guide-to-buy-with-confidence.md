## Buying Pre-Owned Home Appliances with Confidence 

Buying pre-owned home appliances can be a cost-effective way to upgrade your home without breaking the bank. But how do you know what you’re getting is worth the investment? It’s important to go into a purchase knowing what to look for to ensure that the appliance you purchase will work properly and last for a long period of time.

Before making a purchase, do your research. Learn about the different types of appliances and what features are important for your particular needs. Consider the size and the energy efficiency of a particular appliance and look for reviews and feedback from people who’ve had the same appliance. Knowing all of this information ahead of time can help to differentiate between similar models and make sure you make the best decision for your home.

When shopping in person, be sure to inspect the item carefully. Check all the parts and pieces, including power cords, hoses, and wires. Make sure there are no leaks, cracks or broken pieces and ensure that all of the buttons and knobs work as they should. If in doubt, ask the seller lots of questions – they should be able to answer any, or at least all, of the questions you have. 

In the event that the appliance is not working correctly or breaks before you have a chance to use it in your home, make sure you review the seller’s return policy and have contact information so you can get your questions answered. Knowing the seller's return policy, as well as their contact information, will make sure you are able to discuss any concerns that you may have and make sure you don’t end up with an item you are unsatisfied with.

Buying pre-owned home appliances can be a great cost-saving option. It’s important to understand exactly what you’re purchasing and how it can best fit into your home. Use this guide to help you make an informed decision that will last for the long-term.
