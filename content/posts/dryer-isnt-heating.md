If your dryer isn’t heating, it’s likely due to an issue with the heating element, thermostat, or thermal fuse. These are all relatively easy to fix, but it’s important to diagnose the issue before attempting to fix it.

The heating element is responsible for generating the heat that dries your clothes. If it’s not working, the dryer won’t heat up. You can test the heating element with a multimeter to see if it’s working properly. If it’s not, you’ll need to replace it.

The thermostat monitors the temperature of the dryer and cycles the heating element on and off to maintain a consistent temperature. If the thermostat isn’t working properly, it won’t be able to regulate the temperature and the dryer won’t heat up. You can test the thermostat with a multimeter to see if it’s working properly. If it’s not, you’ll need to replace it.

The thermal fuse is a safety device that trips if the dryer gets too hot. If it’s tripped, the dryer won’t heat up. You can test the thermal fuse with a multimeter to see if it’s working properly. If it’s not, you’ll need to replace it.

If your dryer isn’t heating, it’s likely due to an issue with the heating element, thermostat, or thermal fuse. Fortunately, all of these issues are relatively easy to diagnose and fix. Just make sure to test each component with a multimeter before replacing it to make sure it’s the actual problem.
