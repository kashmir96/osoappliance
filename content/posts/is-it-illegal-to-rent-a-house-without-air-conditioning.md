Renting a house without air conditioning can be problematic in areas with hot climates, and it may even be illegal depending on the local laws. In most places, landlords must provide air conditioning, heat, and other basic amenities to tenants. These requirements vary by state and city, so it’s important to understand the local regulations before renting a home without air conditioning.

In some areas, landlords are legally obligated to provide air conditioning for their tenants if it is necessary for the health and safety of the occupants. For example, in California, California Code Section 1941.1 states that all rental units must have an adequate heating system and an appropriate cooling system in each habitable room. If a landlord fails to install or repair an existing cooling system when necessary, they could face fines or other penalties from the housing authority.

In other cases, even if there isn’t a legal requirement to provide air conditioning in rental units, landlords may still choose to do so as part of their lease agreement with tenants. In these instances, renters typically agree to pay utility bills associated with using the air conditioner during their tenancy. 

If you are considering renting a house without air conditioning – either because there is no legal obligation or because you and your landlord have agreed upon this arrangement – there are several things you should take into consideration before signing your lease agreement: 

 -The cost of installing an AC unit: Depending on what type of unit you purchase (window or central AC), installation expenses can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars - costs that may not be covered by your rental agreement.* 

 -The cost of running an AC unit: Air conditioners use electricity and impact your monthly utility bills; make sure you have enough disposable income every month after paying rent for bills associated with running your AC.* 

 -Regional climate conditions: If you plan on living somewhere with warmer temperatures year-round – such as Arizona or Florida – consider how comfortable (or uncomfortable!) living without an AC will be.*

 -Health considerations: For people who suffer from allergies or asthma symptoms that are aggravated by warm temperatures, renting a home without air conditioning may not be ideal.* 

Ultimately whether it is permissible – or even legally required –to rent a house without an AC unit depends on where you live and what local regulations apply. Therefore it’s best to research local laws before signing any leases so that both tenant and landlord know exactly what is expected once move-in day arrives!
