## Successfully Wiring a Garbage Disposal Outlet in Simple Steps 
As a homeowner, you know how important it is to properly install and maintain your garbage disposal outlet. If you donâ€™t, it could result in a costly repair or replacement. Fortunately, wiring a garbage disposal outlet is a simple task that can be accomplished easily with a few simple steps.

The first part of the process is identifying the wiring for the outlet. This can be done by looking for the wiring diagram on the back of the device. Typically, there will be two 120-volt wires, one ground or green wire, and one neutral wire. Once you have identified the wires, you're ready to begin.

Next, you will need to attach the pigment-coated brass terminals to the rear of the device. Attach one terminal to each of the 120-volt wires and the ground or green wire. Secure these with the two screws provided with the appliance. Then, connect the neutral wire to the remaining terminal. 

Once the terminals have been attached, connect the appliance to the garbage disposal unit. Place the garbage disposal unit into the hole in the sink, and then run the 120-volt wires and the ground wire through the upper part of the disposal unit. Secure the disposal unit with the mounting screws provided.

Now that you've secured the unit, you will need to attach the pigmented brass connectors to the lower side of the unit. Connect the neutral wire to the center terminal, the 120-volt wires to the black terminal connectors, and the ground or green wire to the green terminal connector. 

The last step is to attach the outlet box to the garbage disposal unit. This can be done easily by connecting the outlet box and the garbage disposal unit together and then securing them with mounting screws and a metal bracket. Now your garbage disposal unit is securely wired and ready for use. 

Wiring a garbage disposal outlet does not have to be a complicated task. By following a few simple steps, you can easily and safely wire your garbage disposal and get back to using it right away.
