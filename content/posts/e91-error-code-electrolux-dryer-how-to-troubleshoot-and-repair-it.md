## Trouble Shooting Your Electrolux Dryer with E91 Error Code

If you own an Electrolux dryer and notice an E91 error code appears on the display, you likely need to do some troubleshooting and repairs. Fortunately, you can fix this issue with a few simple steps. In this guide, we will explain how to troubleshoot and repair your Electrolux dryer with an E91 error code.

Begin by unplugging the machine from the wall socket and disassembling the access panel, usually located on the inner back of some models. Then take out the screws that hold the top of the machine in place. After the screws are removed carefully lift the top of the machine and locate the blower wheel. This may be a bit tricky to locate, but it will be connected to the motor with a still clip.

Once you've located the blower wheel, check it for any signs of malfunction. You should also examine the motor itself for signs of damage. If the motor is damaged or the blower wheel is dirty or broken, it should be replaced. You may need to purchase a new blower wheel or motor in order to repair your Electrolux dryer with an E91 error code.

The last step is to test the dryer to make sure that the repair was successful. Plug the machine back into the wall socket, turn the dryer on, and wait for the display to show that the E91 code has been cleared. If the error code reappears, then you may need to take your dryer in for a professional repair.

Troubleshooting and repairing your Electrolux dryer with an E91 error code does not have to be a daunting task. By following the steps outlined above, you can quickly and easily diagnose and fix the issue.
