If you’ve been relying on your kettle to fuel your day, only to find that it has suddenly stopped working, you may be wondering why. Kettles are simple and reliable machines, usually easy to fix with some basic troubleshooting. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the most common reasons why your kettle might have stopped working and how to go about fixing it. 

First of all, check if the power cord is securely connected to both the wall outlet and the base of the kettle. If it is not plugged in properly, then this could be causing a power outage and preventing your kettle from switching on. Additionally, if you use an extension cord or surge protector with your appliance, make sure they are plugged in as well and that they are not overloaded with other devices that could disrupt the power supply. 

If everything looks okay with the power cords but the kettle still won’t switch on, then there may be an issue with its internal components. The most common cause of a broken electric kettle is a faulty heating element or thermostat unit which needs replacing than any other problem you might experience. If this is true for you then it's best to take a trip down to your local electronics store where they can provide advice and repair services for most kettles on sale today. 

Finally, if all else fails then it could also be due to mineral buildup inside the appliance itself which reduces its overall efficiency over time due to limescale deposits blocking up important parts such as pipes or valves within its bodywork. It's advised that you descale regularly by filling up half of water in the tank before adding two tablespoons of white vinegar or lemon juice before boiling (and letting cool) twice - this should help get rid of any built-up minerals within your device so that it will function correctly once more! 

To sum up: there can be many reasons why an electric kettle stops working including a faulty power cord connection; broken internal components; or mineral buildup inside of its bodywork which reduces efficiency over time due to limescale deposits blocking up important parts such as pipes or valves within its bodywork - but thankfully these issues can usually be rectified quickly either by yourself at home (if applicable) or via professional repair services available from electronics stores near you!
