## Troubleshooting the U11 Error Code in Panasonic Washing Machines
Troubleshooting a Panasonic washing machine can be tricky, and one of the most common codes is the U11 Error Code. This can be a tricky code to resolve and can have various causes. In this blog, we'll give you the information you need to troubleshoot this issue in your Panasonic washing machine. 

The U11 error code can appear when the machine fails to spin properly. This error code often appears when the wash cycle has completed and the machine is unable to spin out the water. This can be caused by a faulty or incorrectly adjusted spin sensor or a piece of clothing stuck in the drain pump can sometimes cause the issue.

The best way to troubleshoot the U11 error code is to start with the most basic solutions first. Check the door closes properly and check to make sure the spin sensor is adjusted correctly. If the door appears to close properly, then try a quick spin cycle with nothing in it to ensure the spin sensor is operating correctly. It's a good idea to also check the drain pump to ensure nothing has become stuck and is preventing the machine from draining out the water.

If these basic solutions don't work then a more in-depth troubleshooting is necessary. This might involve draining out the excess water manually and then checking the wiring, checking connections, and ensuring the spin sensor is functioning correctly. 

If all else fails, then you might need to call in a professional to look at the machine. Knowing which error code to contact the technician about can be a great help and save time.
