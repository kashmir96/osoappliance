Lennox offers both central units as well as ductless mini-splits that vary in size from single rooms up to entire buildings. They also feature innovative technology such as variable speed motors which help reduce energy consumption by adjusting fan speeds to match cooling demand rather than running at full blast all day long like some other brands do.
