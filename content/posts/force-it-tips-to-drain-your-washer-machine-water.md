## Tips to Force Drain a Washer Machine Water

Knowing how to properly drain your washing machine is a skill everyone who uses a household appliance should have. It's often necessary to force-drain a washing machine if it's not draining properly, or if it needs to be serviced. Follow these tips to force-drain your washer machine water and take back control of the washing process.

The first thing you should do is turn off the power, then disconnect the washer from the power supply. This will make sure that the machine can't accidentally be turned back on during the maintenance process. Then, find the drain hose, which runs from the washer to the drain. Disconnect this hose from the machine, taking care not to make a mess of any water that may still be in the machine.

Next, use a siphon to move the water from the machine to the drain or to a bucket or other container. This can be done by connecting one end of the siphon to the drain hose, then starting the siphone near the top of the machine and the bucket near the bottom. This will ensure that all water is removed, even in hard-to-reach areas.

Once the water has been cleared, you can turn the washer back on and check for any clogs in the water supply lines. If you find any, use a wet/dry vacuum to suction out the clogs. This will help ensure that the washer will not be damaged.

In some cases, the drain hose may be too clogged to allow water to escape. In this case, you should buy a plumbing snake and insert it into the drain hose to remove any blockages.

Knowing how to force-drain a washing machine is an essential part of home maintenance. Following these steps should help you keep your washing machine at peak performance.
