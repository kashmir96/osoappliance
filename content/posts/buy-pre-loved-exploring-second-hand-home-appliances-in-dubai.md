Pre-loved appliances are gently used, often in near-‘new’ condition, purchased from past owners more convenient than buying new. With pre-loved models, you can save big on the brand-name appliances you want without sacrificing quality. 

In addition to offering significant savings, pre-loved appliances are a great way to reduce your ecological footprint. When you buy pre-loved, you’re helping to cut down on the manufacture of new appliances, potentially stabilizing the demand for materials used in production, and reducing the amount of energy used for assembly. You're also reducing waste by reusing an item which is already made.

Major electronics retailers and small businesses provide a plethora of options, ranging from washers and dryers to microwaves and ovens. Before making a purchase, though, remember to inspect each item carefully, ensuring its working order. Additionally, if possible, get an expert's opinion on the condition of the appliance before you invest.
