If your dryer tries to start but won't, there are a few potential causes that could be preventing it from working properly. In this blog, we will discuss the most common reasons for a dryer that won't start and how to troubleshoot the issue.

The first thing to check is the power source. Make sure the dryer is plugged in and that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped. If the dryer is plugged in and the circuit breaker is not tripped, then the issue could be with the dryer's motor. If the motor is not working, the dryer will not start. To test the motor, you can use a multimeter to measure the voltage. If the voltage is low, then the motor needs to be replaced.

Another potential cause of a dryer that won't start is a faulty thermal fuse. The thermal fuse is a safety device that protects the dryer from overheating. If the thermal fuse is blown, then the dryer will not start. To check the thermal fuse, you will need to remove the back panel of the dryer and locate the fuse. If the fuse is blown, it will need to be replaced.

The last potential cause of a dryer that won't start is a faulty start switch. The start switch is responsible for sending an electrical signal to the motor when the dryer is turned on. If the start switch is faulty, then the dryer will not start. To test the start switch, you can use a multimeter to measure the voltage. If the voltage is low, then the start switch needs to be replaced.

If your dryer tries to start but won't, then one of the above issues could be the cause. It is important to troubleshoot the issue and identify the cause before attempting to repair the dryer. If you are not confident in your ability to repair the dryer yourself, then it is best to contact a professional for assistance.
