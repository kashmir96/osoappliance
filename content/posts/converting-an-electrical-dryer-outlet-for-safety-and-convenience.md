## Converting a Dryer Outlet for Safety and Convenience
As a homeowner, one of the most important tasks is to consider the safety of your family and the convenience of having updated and reliable appliances. Converting the electrical outlet that your dryer runs on is an easy and practical way to achieve both of those goals.

For those that are not familiar with the task, converting an electrical outlet entails replacing it with a new receptacle to the current building codes. This means the replacement should meet the applicable National Electrical Code (NEC) requirements. The updated outlet does not have to be a dryer outlet, however many households choose to do so as it comes with a heavy-duty power cord connection and essentially makes the dryer “plug and play.”

When starting such a task, one should make sure to keep safety top of mind. Make sure you turn off the power before beginning to work, double check the circuit box to make sure the current breaker is shut off, and use caution when dealing with wires. It is always a good idea to hire a professional or at least have a knowledgeable friend that is knowledgeable in electrical work oversee the work. 

By converting an electrical outlet, the homeowner will also enjoy some long-term convenience feature. Perhaps the most important benefit is that families can switch out their current dryer with a more modern and efficient model. Choosing from a wider selection of dryers also brings the potential for reducing monthly utility costs in some cases. 

In conclusion, completing the task of converting a dryer outlet not only protects the household from potential electrical issues but can also result in convenience in the present and in the future when making appliance decisions.
