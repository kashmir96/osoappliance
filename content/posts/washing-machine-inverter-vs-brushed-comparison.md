In the world of washing machines, the two most popular types are traditional brushed motors and inverter motors. The difference between these two types of motors can have a significant impact on your laundry experience. So, what is the difference between a washing machine inverter motor vs brushed motor? 

Brushed motors are the traditional form of motor technology used in washing machines. They have been around for many decades and are very reliable in their operation. However, they are generally much louder than their more modern counterparts and also require more energy to operate. This means that although they may be cheaper to purchase upfront, they will be more expensive to run over time due to their energy consumption. 

Inverter motors are the newer type of technology used in washing machines today. These use less power than brushed motors, which makes them more energy efficient and quieter when running your laundry cycle. Additionally, because they rely on fewer moving parts than brushed motors they tend to be less prone to breakdowns or other malfunctions that can occur with traditional brushed motors over time. Inverter motors also tend to last longer as well since there is less wear on the parts due to their design and construction. 

When making a decision between a washing machine inverter motor vs brushed motor it is important to consider both price and efficiency factors as well as how important noise levels are for you when doing laundry at home. While brushing machines may initially cost less upfront, an inverter motor will save you money in the long-term due its lower power consumption and increased longevity compared with a traditional brushing model. Additionally if noise levels are an issue then an inverter model will provide significantly more quiet operation than brushing models so you wonâ€™t be disturbed by loud noises while doing your laundry at home!
