When an error code appears on your Whirlpool Washer's display, it means you are having an issue with the unit or an individual part. Error codes are vital for attempting to diagnose and repair the problem, as they contain specific diagnoses from the manufacturer. You can find the definition of these error codes in the manufacturer's manual, and further guidance in our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). 

Once you have located the code and defined its meaning, the next step is to research the root cause of the problem. Some common causes of error codes in Whirlpool Washers are electric circuit problems, motor failure, faulty solenoids and switches, and defective parts. If the problem persists and you are unable to identify and resolve it yourself, you may need to call a repair service.

There are also general preventative measures you can take to avoid or minimize breakdowns or improper operation. These preventive measures involve regular inspections and maintenance of the appliance. These can include cleaning and adjusting the door seals, inspecting and cleaning the water supply lines, inspecting various part for damage, and replacing worn-out parts.
