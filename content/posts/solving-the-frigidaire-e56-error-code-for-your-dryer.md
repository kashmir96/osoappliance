Frigidaire dryers are valued household appliances built to provide long-lasting and reliable services. When dryers from Frigidaire are in need of assistance, they often display an error code like “E56.” Fortunately, this error code is one of the simpler codes to resolve and understand.

The E56 error code indicates that the unit is stuck in cool-down mode. This error can be caused by the control panel having difficulty reading the temperature sensors. As a first step in troubleshooting this error code, reset the dryer by pressing and holding the “Dry” and “Cancel” buttons simultaneously until the "Dry" light flashes. If the error persists, you will likely need to manually check the internal temperature of the dryer with a thermometer.

Using a standard kitchen thermometer, you can determine if the temperature is too low by inserting it into the sensors. If the thermostat is registering too low, the unit will need to be serviced or replaced.
