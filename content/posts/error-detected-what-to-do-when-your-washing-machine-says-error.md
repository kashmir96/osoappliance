## When You Get An Error From Your Washing Machine
An error code is no fun, especially when it comes to laundry. When your washing machine gives you an error message, you may be tempted to call a service technician right away. But before you start looking up the nearest person to help you with the issue, there are a few steps that you can take yourself to help resolve the issue. 

The first step is to check the manual that came with your washing machine. This can be the quickest and least costly way to figure out the issue and get it addressed without needing help from a specialist. Your instruction manual should provide you with any error codes you may encounter, as well as the associated solutions. But even if your specific code isn’t listed, you may still be able to find the information you need. So, be sure that you take a look through the document for any relevant info that may apply to your error code.

Another great place to find more information about specific error codes is our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). Not only will you find error codes listed, but you’ll also find the explanations or solutions behind them. Whether your washing machine is giving you an error that’s related to water, electricity, or even drainage, chances are you’ll find the information you need to help guide your problem solving.

When an error code appears, it’s important to take a few steps to fix or troubleshoot the issue before involving a technician. But if you feel that the problem is beyond the scope of a self-repair, it’s always a good idea to call in a specialist.

When it comes to issues with your washing machine, knowledge is key. Consult your manual, troubleshoot the issue on your own, and if all else fails, feel free to utilize our Comprehensive Appliance Error Code Glossary for more clarification and understanding. If you still need help, then it may be time to call in a service technician.
