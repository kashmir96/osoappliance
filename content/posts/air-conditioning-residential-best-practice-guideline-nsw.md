Air conditioning is an essential part of life in many parts of Australia. In New South Wales, air conditioning is especially important due to the hot summer climate. As such, it’s important to know and practice the best air conditioning residential best practice guidelines to keep your home comfortable and efficient. 

To begin with, when installing an air conditioner in your home, make sure you use a qualified installer who is accredited under the Australian Refrigeration Council (ARC). This ensures that your system has been installed correctly and complies with safety standards. It’s also recommended that you have regular maintenance done on your system every year by a qualified service technician. This will help ensure that the system runs efficiently and effectively for as long as possible. 

Another important part of air conditioning residential best practice is making sure that the insulation in your home meets or exceeds current building regulations. Insulation helps keep cool air inside during summer months, reducing energy costs and ensuring a more comfortable living environment for occupants all year round. You should also consider using energy-efficient cooling appliances such as ceiling fans, which can be operated at lower power settings than traditional fans while still providing effective cooling relief. 

When operating an existing cooling system, it’s always advisable to set it no lower than 25 degrees Celsius on hot days instead of running it continuously on high settings all day long as this can increase electricity consumption unnecessarily and drive up energy bills over time. Additionally, make sure to clean or replace filters regularly so that airflow remains unobstructed throughout the unit – dirty filters will restrict airflow which causes strain on components resulting in reduced efficiency and increased electricity consumption over time too! 

Finally, if possible – avoid using portable electric heaters during winter months where no central heating exists as these are typically inefficient and costly forms of heating compared to gas or ducted systems for example which provide more even temperatures throughout multiple rooms/areas within one property without any noticeable draft or hotspots from one area to another! Portable electric heaters may be convenient but they are not designed for prolonged usage so should really only be used sparingly when needed most! 

By following these simple but effective tips for air conditioning residential best practice guidelines in New South Wales you should find yourself with a much more efficient and cost-effective cooling solution inside your own home throughout both summer and winter seasons alike!
