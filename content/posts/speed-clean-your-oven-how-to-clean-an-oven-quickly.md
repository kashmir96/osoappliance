## Streamlining Oven Cleaning: Get it Done Quickly
An oven is an essential part of any home kitchen. Most people probably clean their oven a few times a year, and the process can seem like a drag. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to speed up the oven cleaning process. In this article, we'll cover how to get your oven clean in less time.

The most important step in speed cleaning an oven is to reduce the amount of food debris and residue that can become baked on. This means regularly wiping down the interior after each use. If you spot any spills when they first happen, you can also take a few moments to remove them. This is also a great time to check that the oven heating element is not clogged.

If you do need to do a more thorough clean, then start by removing your oven racks. Place them in a sink of hot, soapy water and let them soak while you move onto your oven. Sprinkle baking soda on any baked on stains and leave it on the oven surface for up to an hour. The baking soda will help to loosen the residue.

Spray the baking soda with white vinegar to kick-start the cleaning action. Wipe this off with warm, soapy water. Work in sections for the best results and use a cleaning scourer for the tougher patches. Finally, use a wet cloth to wipe down the oven and clear off any excess cleaning product.

When it comes to speed cleaning an oven, the most important step is to stay on top of it. Regularly removing food debris before it has a chance to bake on can make a huge difference. Additionally, wiping down the interior of your oven can help to spot any potential problems before they get worse.
