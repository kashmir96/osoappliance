Space heaters provide a great way to add warmth to any room, but they can also be dangerous if not used properly. Before using a space heater, it's important to understand the dangers associated with them, and how to use them safely.

Space heaters draw in air from the surrounding area, which can create a fire hazard if the heater is placed too close to combustible materials, such as furniture or curtains. It's important to keep furniture, bedding and curtains at least three feet away from space heaters at all times. In addition, make sure that there are no items on top of or around the space heater that could catch fire. 

Space heaters can also be a shock hazard if they are damaged or have frayed wiring. If your space heater has exposed wires or has been dropped recently, it should be replaced immediately for safety reasons. 

Space heaters must also be plugged directly into an outlet and not into an extension cord; overloading outlets can lead to electrical fires and shocks. In addition, make sure that your space heater is equipped with an automatic shut-off feature in case it tips over or overheats; this will help prevent fires from occurring due to malfunctioning equipment. 

Finally, never leave a space heater unattended when it is on and always unplug it when you're done using it for added safety measures. By following these guidelines and using common sense when operating your space heater, you can ensure that you stay safe while enjoying its benefits!
