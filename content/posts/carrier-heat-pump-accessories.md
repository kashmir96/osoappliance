When it comes to home comfort, a Carrier heat pump is one of the best options. It’s an efficient way to both cool and heat your home, making it ideal for all types of climates. But if you want to get the most out of your Carrier heat pump, you need to equip it with the right accessories.

Carrier offers a variety of accessories that can help you optimize your system’s performance. Here are some of the top accessories that you should consider getting for your Carrier heat pump:

1. Remote Control: With a remote control, you can adjust your system’s settings from anywhere in the house. This makes it easy to keep an eye on temperatures and make changes as needed without having to go outside or even move from one room to another.

2. Zone Control System: If you have multiple zones in your home, then a zone control system is essential for regulating temperatures throughout each area separately. This will help ensure that everyone in the house stays comfortable no matter where they are located at any given time.

3. Programmable Thermostat: A programmable thermostat allows you to set specific temperature levels throughout the day so that energy isn’t wasted when no one is at home or during times when temperatures don’t need to be as high or low as they normally would be during peak hours of usage.. 

4. Air Purifier: A good air purifier will help keep indoor air clean and free from dust, pollen and other allergens that can cause health problems for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions. 
 
5 .Humidification System: If humidity levels get too low inside your home, then a humidification system will help restore them back up again so that everyone remains comfortable—especially during dry winter months when indoor air tends to become overly dry due to lack of moisture outdoors being brought inside by wind and other weather conditions.. 

6 .UV Light Kit: Installing UV lights onto your HVAC unit can help prevent mold growth inside ductwork which may lead to poor indoor air quality over time if left unchecked.. 

No matter which accessories you choose for your Carrier heat pump, they will all work together with its core components (compressor and evaporator coils) in order provide optimal comfort while conserving energy in order save money on utility bills each month!
