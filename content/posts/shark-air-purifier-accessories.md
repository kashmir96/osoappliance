Shark air purifiers are some of the most popular and effective air purifiers on the market. They come with a variety of accessories that can help you keep your air clean and healthy. Here, we’ll take a look at some of the most popular Shark air purifier accessories so you can get the most out of your cleaning device. 

The first accessory to consider is an extra filter for your Shark air purifier. Filters are an important part of any air purifier, and sharks come with HEPA filters that trap 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns in size, including dust, smoke, pollen and pet dander—allowing you to breathe easier in your home or office space. Extra filters should be replaced every 3-6 months depending on usage and environment conditions for maximum effectiveness against airborne debris and odors. 

Another important accessory for your Shark air purifier is a pre-filter set. The pre-filter set helps capture large particles such as hair or pet fur before they enter the main filter, maximizing its efficiency and extending its life span. It also helps reduce noise levels while in operation as it slows down airflow into the system’s motorized fan blades—making it less intrusive when running in quiet areas like bedrooms or offices while operating at peak performance levels when needed elsewhere around your home or business space. 

Finally, if you find yourself needing more portability from your Shark air purifier then consider getting one with wheels attached! Portable models feature two 6-inch wheels that make it easy to move around without any lifting required—perfect for those who need their cleaning device close by but don’t want to have to drag it across carpets or floors every time they need it somewhere else in their home or office space! 

These are just a few of the many accessories available for Shark brand Air Purifiers; there are many more that can help make using yours even more convenient while also providing added protection against airborne allergens, dust mites and other irritants! So if you’re looking for ways to make sure your family is breathing easy no matter where they go then maybe investing in some additional items along with your existing shark will be just what you need!
