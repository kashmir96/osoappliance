## Getting Clean With a Pre-Owned Carpet Cleaner

Carpets are a wonderful addition to any home, but they often require more attention than other flooring. Investing in a pre-owned carpet cleaner allows you to keep your carpets looking their best without spending too much money. Here’s what you need to know when shopping for a used carpet cleaner.

First, it’s important to determine which type of carpet cleaner suits your needs. There are steam cleaners for general spot cleaning on low pile carpets, deep extractors for deep stains, and shampooers for deep cleaning. Understanding the capabilities of each type of machine before you buy allows you to make the best purchase for your purposes. 

Next, inspect the machine before you commit. Check for visible signs of wear and tear, such as broken buttons, frayed cords, and missing parts. Make sure all parts are functional and that the power source is working properly. Ask the seller questions–the more you know, the better. 

You should also ask the seller if they will include detergent, shampoo, or any other necessary products in the purchase. If not, do some research on which products are compatible with the machine. Lastly, make sure to understand the return and warranty policy of the seller. Some businesses may allow for returns and offer warranties on purchases of second-hand products. 

In conclusion, used carpet cleaners can be a great way to keep your carpets looking clean and fresh without spending too much money. Just make sure to research the product, inspect it before purchasing, and understand the return and warranty policies of the seller.
