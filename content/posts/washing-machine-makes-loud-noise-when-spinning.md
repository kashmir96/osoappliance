It’s always a headache when your washing machine starts making loud noises while spinning. You know it’s not supposed to sound like that and you want to figure out what’s wrong before having to call an appliance repair technician from our directory. Before going straight to a professional, here are a few things you can try that may help solve the problem. 

First, check the spin cycle settings on your washer and make sure they are set correctly for the type of load you have in there. The wrong settings can cause excess noise and vibration as the washer goes through its cycles. If needed, adjust them accordingly. 

Second, check for any obstructions in or around the machine that could be causing it to make extra noise during spinning operations. This includes anything from stray pieces of clothing wedged between the drum and sides of the washer or coins caught up in some nook or cranny in or around its parts where they shouldn’t be – both of these can cause excessive noise while spinning as well as imbalance issues with loads inside. 

Third, look at your washer’s suspension system below it – this is often overlooked but can actually play a role in helping reduce vibrations and therefore noise levels during its operation if everything is tight and secure including bolts, springs etc… It is recommended that an experienced technician handle this job if you don’t feel comfortable doing so yourself as there may be some specialized tools required for proper installation/adjustment of parts here which can increase accuracy greatly when done right! 

If after trying all these steps, your washing machine continues to make loud noises while spinning then it might be time to contact an appliance repair technician from our directory who will be able to diagnose more accurately what could possibly be wrong with your unit and repair it accordingly so you won't have any more issues down the road!
