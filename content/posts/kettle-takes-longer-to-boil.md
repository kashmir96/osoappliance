We've all been there: You're in a rush, you need boiling water and the kettle seems to be taking forever. But why does it take so long for a kettle to boil?

In short, it takes time for the heat from the hot plate to travel through the metal of the kettle and into the water inside. The metal acts as an insulator, slowing down the process. Also, if your kettle has a thicker base or walls, this will add to the time needed. Finally, even if you're using a gas hob, electric kettles are usually more efficient at transferring heat into water than direct heat from a burner.

It also takes energy to bring liquid up to boiling point – so if you turn on your kettle with only a small amount of water inside (not filling it up all the way), that's going to take less time than boiling a full kettle of water. And as with any other appliance that uses electricity in your home, kettles can be affected by voltage fluctuations or power outages. So if you live in an area where power cuts are common, this could affect how long it takes for your kettle to boil too! 

Finally, if your kettle has been used for some time already and is covered in limescale – calcium carbonate deposits formed when hard water is heated – then this can also slow down how quickly it boils since limescale acts as an insulator between the heat source and the water in your kettle. So while limescale won't affect how safe it is to drink tap water at home (it just makes coffee and tea taste funny), it will certainly make boiling times longer! 

To sum up: Boiling times depend on several factors including type of heating element (gas vs electric), thickness of base/walls of kitchenware used and voltage fluctuations/power outages in area where you live. Additionally limescale build-up over time can slow down boiling times too - so make sure to descale regularly!
