## Finding the Reason Behind a Washing Machine Error Code
No one likes the feeling of uncertainty that comes when a washing machine stops working, and the display shows a strange code. This can be particularly daunting if it’s a problem you’ve never seen before.

Fortunately, it’s not as difficult as it initially seems to understand the meaning of error codes. The first step when trying to figure it out is to locate the manual for the machine if available. The codes will likely be listed somewhere in the manual. Even if it doesn’t appear to be the exact code displayed, the manual should list possibilities that are likely similar to the problem.

Sometimes a washing machine will display a code that doesn't appear in the manual. This can be frustrating, but all is not lost. In these cases it’s often possible to search online for the manufacturer of the specific model or any information connected with the code. Many codes are shared across different models and manufacturers, which means finding a solution can be as simple as a few clicks.

It’s also worth taking note of the symptoms of the error code. If the code is accompanied by certain noises, smells or extended draining, that may be enough to identify a particular problem. Knowing the signs of a particular error code can make it much easier to narrow down the solutions that are available.

If the issue remains unsolved, it may be worth checking if the machine is still covered by a warranty. The original retailer may be able to offer expert advice on the issue.
