Doing laundry is a necessary part of life, but it can feel like a daunting task. Whether you’re heading to the laundromat or washing your clothes at home, it’s important to know how to do laundry correctly so that your clothes come out looking great and smelling fresh. With the right tips and tricks, you can make your laundry experience less overwhelming and more successful. Here’s how to do laundromat:

1.Gather Your Supplies: Before you go to the laundromat, make sure you have all the supplies that you need, such as detergent, fabric softener (optional), quarters for the machines (many accept credit cards now as well) and a few empty bags for sorting items after they are washed.

2.Sort Your Load: Sort your clothes into separate loads based on water temperature; hot water for whites and colors that require more intensive cleaning, warm water for permanent press items or delicate fabrics like lingerie and cold water for delicates or items labeled “hand wash only”. 

3.Read Labels Carefully: Be sure to read all clothing labels carefully before putting them in the washer so that you know what type of cycle is recommended as well as any special instructions such as air drying or no-heat drying settings. 

4.Set Up Machines: Once everything is sorted out into their respective piles and ready to go in the washer, put each load into its own machine—making sure not overload them—and choose appropriate settings according to label instructions or pre-programmed cycles displayed on most machines these days.. 

 5.Add Detergent & Softener : Add detergent according to label instructions on bottle; if using liquid fabric softener add it during rinse cycle directly into machine drum (not dispenser drawer). For best performance use high efficiency detergents which are specifically designed for front loading machines found in many modern laundromats today - these will help get rid of excess sudsing too!

 6 . Start Washing & Drying Cycles : Now start both washing & drying cycles - be sure not leave wet garments sitting around too long after washer has finished otherwise mildew can develop quickly!

 7 . Remove Clothes From Dryers : When dryers have stopped spinning remove garments promptly from dryers then fold/hang up immediately - this will help reduce wrinkles & keep things wrinkle free! 

 8 . Put Away Your Laundry : Lastly once everything has been folded/hung up place it back into designated bags/baskets then take home - easy peasy! 

 Following these simple tips will ensure that your next trip to the laundromat goes smoothly and successfully with freshly washed clothing every time!
