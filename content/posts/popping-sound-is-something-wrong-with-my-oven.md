## Popping Sounds from my Oven -Is there Something Wrong? 

You hear a series of pops coming from your oven, and you are wondering if something is wrong with it. The popping sound possible coming from your oven may have you concerned, but many times it is nothing to worry about. With some simple troubleshooting, you can get to the bottom of the popping sound. 

### Possible Causes

Your oven may be making the popping sound because of the fan it has in most models or due to the cycle of heating that occurs when cooking pizza, baking, broiling and more. The popping sound is due to the fan cycling on and off when the oven is running in certain cooking modes. This can also occur when foods are cooked at very high settings. 

It is also possible that the popping sound is due to the heating element expanding and releasing the sound. This occurs when any material (wire, ceramic, etc) is heated and cooled. If this is the cause, it could mean that the element has become damaged and has cracked and will need to be replaced. 

You can also try listening to where the sound is coming from. If it’s coming from the middle of the oven, it could mean that the element is cycling on and off as it will be located near the center. If it’s coming from the outside walls near the bottom or top, it may be the fan cycling. In this case, the noise is normal. 

### What to Do Next 

If the popping sound is due to the fan cycled on or off during the cooking process, it is normal and not cause for concern. However, if the popping sound is coming from the heating elements or other parts of the oven, this could indicate that the oven is malfunctioning. 

In cases like these, it is best to enlist the help of a trained appliance repair technician. These professionals can inspect, repair, and maintain all types of appliances. To find a technician near you, visit our [directory of appliance repair technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
