## Unravelling Contact Form 7 Errors: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough
Everybody runs into the occasional appliance error. Though frustrating, these errors don't have to mean the end of the world. In this blog, we'll provide a step-by-step guide for solving the much-dreaded Contact Form 7 Error Code. 

The Contact Form 7 Error is a common yet difficult mistake to unravel. You’ve likely encountered it as a blank page or a generic “white screen of death”. Unfortunately, since there is no descriptive error message, it’s hard to know precisely what the problem is. But have no fear, a little troubleshooting and some quick thinking can get you out of this jam in no time at all. 

First, check on the status of your database. Does the form rely on a Query string that’s returning an empty result? If this is the case, the solution is to locate the query string and check if the associated tables exist. When retrieving data from the database, if a non-existent table is referenced, this unexplained error can be the result. 

It's also helpful to check if the form has been set up correctly. Is there any custom code present in the form that is triggering the error? A common custom code ingredient are shortcake tags. Used for displaying shortcode attributes and fields, shortcake tags can easily stack up and cause the Contact Form 7 Error. Delete any extra code, and the problem should be solved. 

If the form is operational but you're still receiving the error, check to see if there is an extra line break being generated. This too can cause the Contact Form 7 Error. To resolve this, add the ‘br’ parameter to the shortcode, so a line break isn’t added after the shortcode is rendered. 

Lastly, ensure that the function is being declared correctly in the code. This can happen if you incorrectly link the function, or there are typos present. Double-checking your code is key to avoiding this issue. 

If you’ve been experiencing the Contact Form 7 Error, the primary takeaway is to troubleshoot, look for any misconfigurations, and keep your coding clean. With these steps in hand, you can be assured that you’ll be back up and running in no time at all.
