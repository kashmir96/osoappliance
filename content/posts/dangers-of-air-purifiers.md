Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular for their ability to clean the air of dust, pollen, and other airborne particles. While these appliances can help improve indoor air quality, it is important to understand that some air purifiers can actually cause more harm than good. 

First, many air purifiers produce ozone as a byproduct of the cleaning process. Ozone is a toxic gas that can irritate eyes, nose and throat and even cause damage to lungs when inhaled in high concentrations. Ozone generators should not be used in occupied areas as they may pose significant health risks. 

Second, some air purifiers produce ultrafine particles (UFPs). UFPs are so small that they are able to bypass the bodyâ€™s natural defenses and enter deep into the lungs where they can cause inflammation or other health issues. UFPs have been linked to asthma attacks, heart disease, and even cancer in some cases when exposure is prolonged or at high levels. 

Thirdly, many popular air purifiers contain filters made from synthetic materials such as plastics which release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere when heated up or used for long periods of time. VOCs are known carcinogens which can lead to serious health problems with long-term exposure including respiratory issues such as asthma and allergies as well as eye irritation and headaches. 

Finally, it is important to be aware that many commercial grade air purifiers contain hazardous chemicals such as formaldehyde which may be released into your home during use if not properly maintained or serviced on a regular basis. Formaldehyde has been linked with several serious health conditions including certain types of cancer so it is best avoided if possible by choosing an alternative product without this chemical component included in its construction materials or filter design elements . 

In conclusion , while an effective way of improving indoor air quality , using an incorrect type of Air Purifier may result in more harm than good .It's always advisable therefore ,to do adequate research before investing in any kind of Air Purifier ,and also pay attention towards maintenance requirements for ensuring best results .
