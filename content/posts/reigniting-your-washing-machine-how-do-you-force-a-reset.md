## Resetting Your Washing Machine For A Fresh Start
If you're having trouble with your washing machine, you may need to force a reset. Washing machine malfunctions can range from buzzing or vibrating noises to mysterious odors to not spinning at all. Resetting your washing machine can get it running smoothly again, and can be a straightforward process.

Before you begin resetting your washing machine, it’s a good idea to unplug it from the wall outlet. This is a safety precaution which can protect you from a nasty shock if your machine has an exposed electric wire. It’s also important to check the manufacturer’s documentation to make sure you’re using the correct method for resetting your washing machine.

Once you’ve unplugged your washing machine, locate the reset button. Depending on the model of your unit, this reset button may also be referred to as a restart button. It can look like a circular button, or it might be a rocker switch with a downward arrow. You might need to use a screwdriver to locate the reset switch.

When you press or toggle the reset switch, your washing machine should reset itself and begin to operate normally. If your machine still isn’t functioning correctly after resetting the switch, you should consult your manufacturer's manual or contact their customer service team to troubleshoot the issue.

Resetting your washing machine periodically can help keep it running smoothly for years to come. Keeping track of error codes your machine produces can help you fix a problem more quickly, so it’s worth checking out our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary for more information. 

With just a few simple steps, you can reset your washing machine and get it running optimally again. Ensure your safety and familiarize yourself with the instructions from your manufacturer, and you can be back to clean clothes in no time!
