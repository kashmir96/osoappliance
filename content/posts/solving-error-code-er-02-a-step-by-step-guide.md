However, in some cases, the code can be resolved at home. This article will outline how to troubleshoot and diagnose error code ER 02 across a range of home appliances.

Error code ER 02 typically suggests that there is a problem with the device’s electronic control board. The control board is responsible for powering and controlling the device’s functions.
