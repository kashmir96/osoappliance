## What Does a Flashing E4 Error Code on My Appliance Mean?
Are you trying to figure out the meaning of a flashing E4 code on your household appliance? It's important to take a look at the code flashing on your appliance, as it can give you insight into what may be going on with the machine. In this blog, we'll help you understand what a flashing E4 code means, and how you can address it.

The E4 code is an error code that typically appears on laundry machines and refrigerators, specifically those made by Whirlpool. It indicates that there is a water supply issue. In other words, the appliance has detected that there is either an insufficient flow of water or the machine doesn't sense that any water is coming in. This could be due to clogged or blocked pressure valves or inlet hoses.

To troubleshoot E4 code yourself, start by checking the water supply in the back of the machine. Make sure the float switch is not stuck or jammed, and that water is able to flow freely through the inlet hoses. Then, check the drain pump to assure that the hoses are securely connected and that no obstructions are blocking them.

If these steps do not fix the flashing E4 code, it may be time to call a professional to address the malfunctioning appliance. A professional has the knowledge and experience to correctly diagnose and repair the machine, ensuring that its performance is restored to working order.

When your household appliance flashes an Error Code E4, it is essential to act quickly to figure out the cause and take steps to troubleshoot and fix the problem. Fortunately, with a little bit of effort and knowledge, you can usually assess and resolve this error without involving a technician.
