Cookers are an essential part of any kitchen, providing a safe and convenient way to cook meals. But what many people don’t realise is that having an electrical socket above your cooker can be incredibly useful. 

Having an electrical socket above your cooker makes it easier to use small appliances while you’re cooking, such as blenders or food processors. This means that you don’t have to move the appliance away from the countertop and risk spilling ingredients before they make it into the pan. Additionally, if you have a fan above your stove, having an electrical socket nearby can help reduce cooking odours and keep your kitchen smelling fresh. 

But safety should always come first when it comes to electricity in the home. It’s important to ensure that all wires are properly insulated and there is no risk of electric shock or fire hazard. If you’re going to install a socket yourself, make sure you know exactly what you’re doing – otherwise enlisting the help of an experienced electrician is always a good idea! 

In conclusion, having an electrical socket above your cooker can be a great way to make cooking easier and more efficient in the kitchen – just remember to take all necessary safety precautions first!
