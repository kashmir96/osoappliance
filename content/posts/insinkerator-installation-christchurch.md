Installing an Insinkerator in Christchurch can be a great way to upgrade your kitchen. Whether you’re replacing an old unit or installing one for the first time, it’s important to get it right. Here’s a guide to help you through the process.

First, make sure you have all the necessary parts and tools for installation. You’ll need a power drill and drill bits, pliers, adjustable wrench, screwdriver, and a level. You should also have some sealant and pipe tape on hand for any plumbing connections.

Next, turn off the power to your kitchen at the circuit breaker before beginning any work. Then locate the sink drain inlet and remove any existing garbage disposer if there is one installed already. Disconnect any plumbing connections from the disposer before removing it completely.

Now it's time to install your new Insinkerator! Start by attaching the discharge elbow to the bottom of your unit using a wrench or pliers. Then attach the gasket and mounting ring with screws provided in your kit. Place your unit into position over the sink drain opening and secure with screws provided in your kit as well as sealant around edges of unit if necessary for a watertight fit.

Once secured in place, connect all plumbing lines according to manufacturer instructions included with your kit. Make sure all connections are tight and secure before turning on power at circuit breaker box again. Finally, test out your new Insinkerator by running cold water through it while grinding up some food waste - if everything is working properly then you’re done! 

Installing an Insinkerator in Christchurch can be a great way to upgrade your kitchen while saving money on food waste disposal costs over time - just make sure you follow these steps carefully so that everything is installed correctly!
