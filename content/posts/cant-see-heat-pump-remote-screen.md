# Cant see heat pump remote screen

If you have a heat pump, chances are you’ve experienced the issue of not being able to see the screen on your heat pump remote. This can be incredibly frustrating, especially if you rely on your heat pump to keep your home comfortable. Fortunately, there is usually an easy fix for this problem and it typically doesn’t require any special tools or expertise. 

The most common cause of not being able to see the screen on a heat pump remote is that the batteries in the remote have died or are running low. If this is the case, simply replace them with new fresh batteries and check if that resolves the issue. 

It's also possible that there could be something blocking the signal from transmitting from your remote to your heat pump. This could be something like furniture or even just distance between you and your unit. Move anything blocking in front of or behind your unit and try again - moving closer may also help! 

If neither of these two solutions solves your issue, then it’s possible that there could be something wrong inside of either your remote or unit itself. If this is the case, unfortunately you will need to contact a professional heating service technician as further troubleshooting beyond simple battery replacement may be needed in order to resolve it properly. 

In conclusion, not being able to see the screen on a heat pump remote can usually be resolved quickly and simply by replacing its batteries with new ones; however if this doesn't work then it's best to contact a heating service technician for further assistance as there could be an underlying issue inside either component that requires more specialized handling than just changing out some batteries can provide.
