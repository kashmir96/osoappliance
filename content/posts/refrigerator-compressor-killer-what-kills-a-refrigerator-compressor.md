## Refrigerator Compressor Killer: What Causes a Refrigerator Compressor to Stop Working?

Most homeowners depend on their refrigerators to keep food fresh without fail, often without considering how the appliance actually works. But knowing how a refrigerator compressor works – and what kills them – can help reduce the risk of costly repairs in the future. 

A refrigerator compressor is a motor that helps pump coolant through the appliance, keeping everything inside cool and safe to eat. While a refrigerator compressor should last as long as the rest of the appliance (around 10–15 years), there are several common causes of failure. 

One is low voltage power supply. Refrigerator compressors require a certain source of power (115 volts of electricity) to keep food cold. If the power supply is not operating at that correct voltage, the compressor will suffer. Low voltage can cause an overload in the compressor, leading to it ceasing to work altogether. 

Another common cause of refrigerator compressor problems is moisture. Moisture can cause corrosion inside the compressor, leading to a number of other issues, including overheating and increased drag on the motor. If the refrigerator doesn’t have a tightly sealed door gasket or vents, moisture or condensation can seep in and compromise the compressor. 

Finally, using a refrigerator for longer-term storage of items can increase the risk of compressor failure. If a refrigerator is not used regularly, the compressor’s internal components can start to degrade, leading to possible issues.

To prevent refrigerator compressor problems, the most important step is preventative maintenance. Regularly check that your power supply is at the correct voltage and pay attention to any moisture around the refrigerator. Regularly inspecting the door gasket and checking the refrigerator vents can also help prevent these problems. 

If you think your refrigerator compressor has failed, take a look at our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary for more information. Knowing the error codes and signs of compressor failure can save time and money when attempting a repair.
