## Troubleshooting and Fixing a Broken Dryer Coil

If your dryer's heating coils are malfunctioning, it can be a frustrating and time consuming experience. Fortunately, there are some easy steps you can take to diagnose and repair your dryer coils yourself. In this blog post, we will cover the steps you need to take to diagnose and fix a broken dryer coil. 

The first step you should take when diagnosing a dryer coil problem is to check the power supply. The power supply to a dryer is typically a 220-volt circuit, and it needs to have the correct voltage in order to work properly. If the voltage is not correct, the dryer won't heat up. Once you've determined the power supply is correct, the next step is to check the coils themselves. To do this, you'll want to open the back of the dryer, locate the heating element and inspect it for any visible damage. If there is visible damage, then the coils will need to be replaced. 

Once you've determined that the coils are the issue, the next step is to replace them. This can be done by unplugging the dryer and removing the wires from the heating element and carefully removing the old coils. Then, you'll want to obtain the new coils (they should be available at your local appliance store) and reconnect them in the same manner in which the old ones were connected. 

Finally, once the new coils have been installed, you'll also want to make sure that the newly replaced coils are receiving power. To do this, you can use a voltage meter to check the wiring to make sure the proper voltage is being supplied to the coils. If everything looks good, then you can plug the dryer back in and turn it on to make sure the coils are working properly. 

In conclusion, with a little bit of troubleshooting and some help from a voltage meter, you can diagnose and repair a broken dryer coil yourself.
