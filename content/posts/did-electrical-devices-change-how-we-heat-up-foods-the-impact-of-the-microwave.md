## Reflection on How Electrical Devices Impacted Food Heating

The invention of electrical devices has significantly impacted how we heat up and prepare foods. These appliances offer innovative solutions to faster and healthier cooking. However, the most impactful device to come out of this wave of innovation is without a doubt the microwave. 

The microwave has completely revolutionized how food is prepared in homes and restaurants. One of the main benefits to the microwave is its speed. On average, microwave ovens can cook and heat up food up to 4 times faster than conventional ovens. For example, a conventional oven takes 20-30 minutes to bake a casserole, but a microwave oven can do the same job in 5 minutes. 

The other major benefit to microwaving foods is the fact that it preserves more of the natural vitamins, enzymes and minerals that are found in fresh foods. With regular ovens, these same minerals and vitamins are often cooked off or destroyed before the food is done. This means that microwave cooking is healthier and more nutritious for consumers. Additionally, microwaves are easier to clean than conventional ovens, meaning minimal cleanup time is required. 

The impact of the microwave has been undeniable. Now, households and restaurants all around the globe have access to a device that can heat up food faster and more healthily than ever before. Since the advent of the microwave, our lives have grown easier and quicker in the kitchen.
