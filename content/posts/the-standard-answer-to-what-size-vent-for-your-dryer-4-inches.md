## What Size Vent is Needed for Home Dryers?
When shopping for a new dryer, or replacing and old one, a common question is: “What size vent is needed?” The answer may surprise you: 4 Inches. This universal standard has been adopted by most dryer manufacturers, eliminating the need to guess which size is necessary.

A dryer’s vent is responsible for removing the damp, hot air created by drying clothes. Hot air and lint travel through the vent system, eventually letting it out of your home. The lint trap located at the bottom of the dryer is designed to collect the lint and keep it from traveling through the vent, but the amount of lint the trap can collect is dependent on the size of the vent. With a smaller vent, the lint build-up in the trap will be greater, and it can actually act as a fire hazard. For this reason, 4 Inches as become the accepted standard in the U.S.

The actual ducting used for a standard 4 Inch vent comes in rigid or flexible aluminum. Many people opt for the flexible aluminum ducting because it is easier to install and maneuver. The rigid aluminum option helps for a smoother, straighter vent line that can help reduce lint build-up and improve air flow. Some important things to remember when installing the dryer’s vent are that the length of the vent should not exceed 25 feet, and the vent should use a 90 degree elbow at both ends.

Regardless of which option you choose for the dryer’s vent, 4 Inches is the standard answer for what size is needed. It’s not just a suggestion – it’s recommended to follow this standard which helps keep your dryer in proper working condition and safe from fire hazards.
