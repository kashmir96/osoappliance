## Finding the Best Electric Range Hood for Your Home

Keeping your kitchen air clean and free from odors can be a challenge without the right electric range hood to help. With so many options on the market, it can be difficult to know which electric range hood will be best for your needs. In this blog, we will take a look at some of the important factors that come into play when choosing an electric range hood, so you can be sure to find the perfect fit. 

The first consideration to factor in when shopping for an electric range hood is the clearance. This will determine the efficiency of the appliance, as the more space that is between the cooking surface and the hood, the better the performance it can have. To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended that most electric range hoods should be positioned at least 18 inches to 30 inches above the cooking surface. This distance ensures that the air is being effectively drawn from the stove or cooktop, so it can be filtered and released back in the kitchen\

Another important factor to take into consideration when selecting an electric range hood is the fan size. The larger the fan, the more air it will be able to draw in, resulting in a cleaner indoor air environment. However, it is important to balance the size of the hood with the size of your cooking space; over-sized hoods can disrupt the aesthetic of your kitchen, so it is important to find a size that complements the area. 

In addition to factors such as placement and size, users should also look into the different styles of electric range hoods that are available. Under-cabinet styles are the most common, and can be integrated into kitchen cabinetry for a cleaner look. Wall-mounted styles are also an option and can come with a luxurious espresso finish, or other colored shades to fit the theme of the kitchen. Lastly, island-mounted styles provide an unobstructed view of the cooking surface. 

By understanding the necessary clearance, size, and design options associated with electric range hoods, you can be sure to find the perfect fit for your kitchen. With the right electric range hood, you can help create a healthier home environment by filtering odors and contaminants from the air.
