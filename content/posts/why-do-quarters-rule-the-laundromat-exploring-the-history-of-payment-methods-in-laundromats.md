## Quarters: The Dominant Payment Method in Laundromats
Though newer technologies are replacing coins in many places, quarters still dominate in one unlikely corner of the retail world: laundromats. Why do quarters rule here and how did it become the de facto payment method? Let's explore the fascinating history of payment methods in laundromats.

Originally, coin-operated laundry machines relied on tokens, which were metal discs with a punchmark in the middle. Customers would purchase tokens at the laundromat and then use them to power the machines. From the perspective of laundromat owners, tokens simplified accounting by allowing them to purchase the coins in bulk and just tally the tokens at the end of the day.

The token system ends up being short-lived, however, with the introduction of coin-operated laundry machines in the 1940s. Suddenly, customers could insert coins directly into the machines instead of relying on tokens. Quarters quickly became the coin of choice for laundromats, as they were the optimal size and weight that would not jam the machines. In addition, quarters have a convenient divisibility; users could easily pay for a wash and a dry—25 cents for the wash, 25 for the dry—with just one coin. 

From there, the quarter's reign only increased. By the latter part of the century, many laundromats began using coin sorters that accepted quarters and other coins. The coin sorters were very convenient, allowing customers to pour their loose change into the machine, which would pile the coins based on denomination. This allowed customers to insert larger amounts of change into the machine, simplifying the process of doing laundry. In addition, laundromat owners appreciated the convenience of coin sorters, since they simplified the process of collecting coins at the end of the day. 

Today, many laundromats still rely on coins, although some have started to offer alternative payment methods such as debit and credit cards. Despite the availability of these methods, however, quarters remain the dominant payment option in laundromats and show no signs of going away anytime soon.

When it comes to doing laundry, it's clear that quarters still rule the day.
