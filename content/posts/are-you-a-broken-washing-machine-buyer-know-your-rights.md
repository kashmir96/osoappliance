## Do You Know Your Rights When Buying a Broken Washing Machine?

If you’re planning on buying a broken washing machine, it’s essential to understand your rights as a consumer. With a lack of information and warranties, broken washing machine buyers should be aware of the risks they face when purchasing an appliance that might not even work. Here we outline the most important considerations to keep in mind when searching for a broken washing machine online. 

## Have All Repairs Been documented & Checked?

When purchasing a broken washing machine it’s important to inspect the appliance thoroughly. Ensure all repairs have been properly documented and check for any signs of further damage. A specialised technician should give you a detailed report on the machine’s condition, as well as any recommendations on further repair needed. Without these assurances, buyers risks spending more money on repairs than they paid for the original purchase. 

## Where to Find Reliable Technicians?

An important part of being a broken washing machine buyer is to partner with a reliable appliance repair technician. A qualified technician can provide further advice and assurance on the faulty appliance. With an adequate technician-buyer relationship, the buyer can have peace of mind knowing that the repair costs are accurate and the repairs are done by experienced professionals. 

## Know Your Rights as a Consumer

Most importantly, buyers should be aware of their legal rights when purchasing a broken washing machine from a private seller. In most cases, buyers cannot be held responsible for a malfunctioning appliance, but unfortunately, not all sellers will advise buyers of their rights. Ultimately, it’s important for broken washing machine buyers to be cautious and know their rights when making a purchase.
