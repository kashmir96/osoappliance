Cleaning appliances at home is an essential part of maintaining both their performance and the cleanliness of your home. To ensure that these appliances stay in top condition, it’s important to regularly clean them so they don’t accumulate dirt, dust, or grime. Here are some tips for cleaning common appliances at home.

Refrigerator: Start by removing all food items from the fridge and freezer and discard any expired items. Then, use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the interior walls and shelves of both compartments. Vacuum the coils located on the back or bottom of the fridge to remove dust buildup; this will help keep your refrigerator running efficiently. Finally, add a few drops of lemon essential oil to a spray bottle filled with water for an all-natural way to freshen up your refrigerator and neutralize odors.

Oven: Start by removing any crumbs or debris from inside with a vacuum cleaner nozzle attachment before wiping down surfaces with warm soapy water or an all-purpose cleaner. If you have stubborn stains or baked-on grease, use a paste made from baking soda and water — it should dissolve easily when scrubbed using an abrasive pad or brush such as steel wool. Finish off by wiping down surfaces again with warm water once you’re done cleaning for extra shine! Make sure you turn off power to the oven before taking off any parts or applying cleaners directly onto electrical components like heating elements to avoid potential shock hazard.

Dishwasher: Fill up detergent cups according to instructions on detergent package if needed; then run hot water in sink until it’s full enough that dishwasher can draw from it (this helps get rid of food particles). Empty out filter tray underneath dishwasher as well as trap under lower spray arm; scrub away any food particles stuck here using toothbrush if necessary then set aside for drying out overnight (or longer). Rinse interior walls and floor of dishwasher with hot soapy water then rinse thoroughly afterwards; finally polish stainless steel exterior dry with microfiber cloth for extra shine!
