## Clearing Samsung Dryers Error Codes

If you own a Samsung dryer, chances are your unit has a small error code displayed on the control panel that needs to be troubleshot and resolved. Don't worry! The process of clearing error codes on a Samsung dryer is straightforward - here's how I did it.

First, I read the error code displayed on the control panel. Most Samsung Dryers have LED indicators that can be matched up to an error code guide. This is found in the user manual or online service help guide. Once you've identified the error code and what it means, you can proceed to the next step. 

Next, I manually cleared the error code. You'll need to unplug the dryer or switch off the power at the breaker box before you do this. Then press and hold the Start/Pause button for at least 5 seconds and the error code should be cleared from the control panel. 

Finally, I tested the dryer to make sure that the error code was cleared. After plugging the dryer back in or turning the power back on, run a short test cycle and wait to see if the error code reappears. If not, the error code has successfully been cleared & your dryer is ready to use.

Clearing an error code on a Samsung Dryer is relatively easy. It's important to take the time to correctly identify the error code and move through the proper steps to clear it.
