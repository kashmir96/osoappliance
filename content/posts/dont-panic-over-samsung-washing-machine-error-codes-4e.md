## Finding Calm Amidst Error Code 4E on a Samsung Washing Machine

It’s understandable to feel concerned when you are using a household appliance and encounter an error code. Especially if the appliance is from a reputable and well-known brand such as Samsung, it can cause pause and feelings of distress. Don’t worry—error codes are not as big of a deal as they initially seem. With the right knowledge, a helpful troubleshooting guide, and a bit of patience, your Samsung washing machine error can be resolved.

Error code 4E is an indication that there’s a problem relating to the water supply. This can usually be solved by doing the following:

- Make sure the hot and cold water tap faucets are fully turned on.
- Make sure hoses are connected properly to the correct faucet handles, and there are no kinks or bends in the hoses.
- Make sure there are no foreign/loose objects inside both hot and cold water inlet valves on the washer.

If your washer has a hose filter, make sure it is not clogged up and replace it if it is. Remove any debris from the inlet hoses, and make sure the screens are not clogged with sediment. The water pressure in the two hoses should be the same. Generally, an adequate water pressure for washing machines is 20 to 80 pounds per square inch (PSI). If all of these steps fail to resolve the issue, you may need to contact a professional to check for a more severe problem.

Error codes can be quite tricky to diagnose, but you don’t need to panic if your Samsung washing machine is displaying an error code. You can usually troubleshoot many smaller problems yourself with the proper owner's manual and a bit of patience. If the problem persists, or if it is clearly something that requires professional assistance, seek help from one of your local appliance repair professionals.
