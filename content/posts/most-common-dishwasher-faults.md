When it comes to dishwashers, there are many common faults that can occur and cause problems. From a faulty pump to a broken door seal, these issues can be difficult to identify and fix. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the most common dishwasher faults and how you can diagnose them.

The first issue is a clogged filter or drain hose. This is one of the most common dishwasher faults and occurs when the filter becomes blocked with food particles or other debris. To diagnose this problem, check for blockages in the filter as well as any kinks or blockages in the drain hose leading from your dishwasher to your kitchen sink. If all seems clear, then it’s time to clean out the filter basket by removing any debris that has collected inside it.

Another issue is a faulty pump motor which will cause water not to circulate properly throughout your machine causing poor cleaning results or even flooding if left unattended for long periods of time. If you notice that your dishes aren’t coming out as clean as they should be, then chances are you have a faulty pump motor on your hands. To test this problem out, run some hot water through your machine while also running an empty cycle without any dishes in it and see if anything changes – if nothing changes then you likely have a bad motor on hand which will need replacing by an appliance technician before using again. 

The third most common fault is with door seals becoming loose over time due to wear and tear from regular use of opening/closing cycles – this can allow water leaks during operation resulting in wasted energy usage and possible damage to surrounding areas near the dishwasher itself depending on where it's located at home (e..g underneath cabinets). To identify whether or not this is an issue for you – simply inspect around where the seal meets with both sides of each door panel – if there appears to be gaps between them then its likely that they need replacing ASAP before further damage occurs! 

Finally, another frequent problem encountered involves detergent dispensers becoming clogged up over time due either too much build-up of soap residue inside them or incorrect amounts being used during each wash cycle (i..e too little/or too much). The best way around resolving such issues? Try running an empty cycle without any dishes first but adding vinegar into each compartment - letting sit overnight will help dissolve away stuck-on grime while also deodorizing at same time! Afterwards just make sure correct amount detergent being added next round when loading up machine again afterwards (usually 1 tablespoon per load). 

In conclusion, these are some of our top tips for diagnosing some of the most common dishwasher faults so hopefully now you feel more prepared when identifying problems within yours!
