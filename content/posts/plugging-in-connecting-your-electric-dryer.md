## Get Ready to Connect Your Electric Dryer
Plugging in your electric dryer is an important step in ensuring your laundry stays fresh and clean. Setting up your dryer correctly will make all the difference in keeping your clothes looking and feeling great. Here we will discuss everything you need to consider when plugging in your electric dryer.

When installing an electric dryer, you must make sure it is wired correctly to ensure it is safe to use with your home's electrical system. Before attempting to plug it in, check to make sure the dryer has the correct outlet. An electric dryer requires a 220-240 volt, 30-amp outlet, with four prongs – two hots, one neutral and one ground – to provide the proper power supply. A dryer with a three-prong plug needs a special adapter and should be replaced with a new dryer with the newer four-prong plug.

You should double check the voltage and mark on the dryer to make sure it matches the outlet. There should be a section inside the dryer's instruction manual that mentions the voltage. This is to prevent overloading your circuit. When plugging in your dryer, look to see what type of plug it uses. Some dryers are hardwired into your home and do not have a removable plug.

While all appliances must be plugged into a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupt) outlet, electric dryers require special attention. You must use a 30-amp two-pole breaker with the correct wire size. Your local home improvement store should have the necessary supplies.

Now that you know how to plug in your electric dryer correctly, you can be reassured knowing your dryer is safe and correctly installed. Doing the job yourself may sound intimidating but with a few simple steps, you can complete the installation with ease.
