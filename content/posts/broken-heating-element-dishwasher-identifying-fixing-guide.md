## Identifying & Fixing a Broken Heating Element in a Dishwasher

When your dishwasher stops heating your water, it's usually a sign of a broken heating element. Fortunately, this is a relatively simple repair job for any handy homeowner and can help get your dishwasher up and running in no time. In this article, we'll outline how you can identify the problem with your dishwasher's heating element and how to fix it. 

The first step in fixing a broken dishwasher heating element is to identify what might be causing the issue. Common causes of a broken heating element are an old element that's past its lifespan, a problem with the electrical connection to the element, or clogs in the water filter. The easiest way to find out what is causing the problem is by inspecting the element itself. Check the element for signs of wear and tear or other damage that could be causing it to malfunction. Furthermore, make sure all the electrical connections are in working order and that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped. 

If the problem is an old heating element or a broken connection, the most cost-effective solution is to replace the element. Luckily, the process of replacing the element is fairly simple, especially if you've identified the cause of the malfunction. Simply unplug the dishwasher and remove the access panel. Here you should be able to see the heating element, as well as the power wires that are connected to it. Unscrew the element and then remove the wires, checking to ensure they're still in good condition. Reattach the new element and its wires and then plug the dishwasher back in. 

If you suspect there is clogging in the water filter, you can flush it out by running a cycle with cleaning solution. Be sure to unplug the dishwasher first and then use a mixture of white vinegar and water to run a separate cycle. Once the cycle is complete, run a few empty cycles to rinse the dishwasher. The clogged filter should then be cleared and the element should start to work properly again.

If you're uncomfortable carrying out the repairs for a broken heating element on your own, it's recommended that you get in touch with a qualified appliance repair technician to help you.

Identifying and fixing a broken heating element in a dishwasher is a relatively straightforward repair job for anyone with basic handyman knowledge. You just need to inspect the element for any damage, replace it if necessary, and potentially clear out any blockages.
