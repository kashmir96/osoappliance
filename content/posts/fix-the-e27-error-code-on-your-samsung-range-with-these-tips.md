## Fixing the E27 Error Code on Your Samsung Range 
If you're having trouble with your Samsung range and you've noticed the error code E27, don't worry. This error code is not uncommon and can generally be fixed quickly with a few simple steps. Here we will discuss the basics of how to troubleshoot and fix this error code. 

The first thing to do is to figure out what the code E27 is telling you. This code indicates that a problem exists with the temperature in the range. Use a thermometer to check the temperature. If it is lower than set or greater than expected, then the E27 code could be indicating an issue with the temperature sensor.

Next, check the heating element in the range. If it is thermally overloaded or malfunctioning, it could be the problem. If the temperature issue is identified as originating from the heating elements, you might be able to get it back into working order by resetting it and waiting for it to cool down. If resetting does not fix the issue, the heating element most likely needs to be replaced.

In the case that the problem does not lie with the heating elements, the E27 code might be due to an issue with the range's burner switch, which controls the spark module. If it cannot detect the spark, it may display the E27 code. To troubleshoot this, try unplugging the switch, waiting 15-20 minutes, then plugging it back in and trying again. If this does not fix the issue, then the switch may need to be replaced. 

Finally, a software issue might be to blame. The range could be running an old version of software that is no longer supported. In this case, you will need to either upgrade the range's software or reset it completely.

With these tips, you should be able to effectively fix the E27 error code on your Samsung range. If you're still having trouble, or if you don't feel comfortable troubleshooting the issue on your own, you can find a professional appliance repair technician in your area using our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
