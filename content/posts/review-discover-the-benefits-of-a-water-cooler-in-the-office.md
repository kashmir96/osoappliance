## Enjoy the Benefits of a Water Cooler in the Office

Office water coolers provide a convenient, cost effective and eco-friendly way to quench the thirst of your team. In addition to providing a regular source of clean, cold drinking water, water coolers also offer many other benefits for the office.

Here, we explore why a water cooler might be the ideal addition to your office.

### Variety of Drinks

A water cooler offers more than just cold, pure water. Depending on the model, you can provide your staff with a variety of flavored water, hot chocolate, and even freshly brewed coffee. From herbal tea to sports drinks, you can choose beverage options that best suit your team’s preferences.

### Saves Money

Buying bottled water for staff can be expensive. A water cooler works out much more cost effective, as you’ll only have to pay for the cost of the cooler itself and whichever type of water canisters you need to fill it.

### Hygienic and Safe

When carrying heavy bottles of water or removing lids, there can be a risk of harmful bacteria or germs being transmitted. With a water cooler, people can simply press a button to dispense pure, filtered water without any need to touch the cooling system.

### Customizable Options

Most coolers have adjustable cooling temperatures, so you can choose the preferred temperature for staff to enjoy their beverages. You can also choose between tabletop and floor-standing dispensers and pick the style that best suits your office.

### Eco-Friendly

For many office staff, single-use plastic is a major cause of concern. Using a cooler cuts down on this waste, as staff can refill their own bottles as often as they like.

A water cooler is a great way to boost staff morale, enhance productivity and keep your team hydrated. It can even save you money in the long-term by cutting down on the need for excessive bottled water purchases. 

To get the most from your water cooler and manage any potential repairs or maintenance requirements, be sure to enlist the help of a qualified professional.
