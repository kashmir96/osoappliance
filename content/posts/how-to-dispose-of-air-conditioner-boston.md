As the summer months approach, many Boston residents are turning to their air conditioners to keep cool. But when it’s time to replace your air conditioner, how do you properly dispose of it? While it can be tempting to just throw the old unit away, there are important steps you should take in order to properly and safely get rid of your air conditioner.

The first step is determining whether or not your air conditioner contains hazardous materials. If so, the unit will need to be disposed of at a special waste disposal facility. These materials can include Freon and other refrigerants that are toxic and can harm the environment if released into the atmosphere. Many cities and towns in Massachusetts have hazardous waste collection sites where you can take these types of items for safe disposal. To find out if your area has one, contact your local Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

If your unit does not contain hazardous materials, you may be able to recycle it through a local recycling center or scrap metal yard. Check with them first as some centers may not accept air conditioners due to their size and weight. If they do accept them, make sure you bring all components including fans, motors, compressors etc., as they may also contain valuable metals that can be recycled or reused. 

Finally, if neither option is available in your area or if the unit is beyond repair or reuse, then you will need to hire a professional junk removal service in order to dispose of it properly. These services specialize in large item removal and will ensure that all components are disposed of safely and according to regulations set by environmental authorities. 

By following these steps when disposing of an old air conditioner in Boston area ,you can help protect our environment from dangerous pollutants while also ensuring that valuable resources get reused whenever possible!
