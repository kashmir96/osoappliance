A dishwasher is a great way to save time and energy when it comes to washing dishes. But how long does it take for a dishwasher to do its job? 

The answer depends on several factors, including the type of dishwasher you have, the type of dishes you're washing, and your selected cycle. Generally speaking, most standard cycles will take between one and two hours to complete. 

The pre-rinse cycle is typically the quickest option, taking around 10 minutes. This cycle removes most food particles from the dishes before the main wash cycle begins. 

The main wash cycle can range from 30 minutes up to 2 hours depending on which program you select (heavy-duty or light). Heavy-duty cycles are designed for heavily soiled dishes whereas light cycles are better suited for lightly soiled items. For instance, if you're dealing with greasy pans or casserole dishes that have been sitting in your sink overnight, choose the heavy-duty setting as this will provide more thorough cleaning results. 

If your dishwasher has an additional sanitizing cycle (usually available on some high-end models), it may add an extra 15–20 minutes onto your total washing time as this process requires hot water temperatures above 140°F (60°C). 

Finally, depending on what type of machine you have and its settings, a drying phase may be added at the end of each wash cycle which could take up to an hour or more if left running until all dishes are completely dry. So all in all it can take anywhere from around 1 hour up to 3 hours for a dishwasher to do its job properly!
