## No Challenge Too Big To Overcome Beko Washing Machine E13 Error 

Household appliances are a cornerstone of any well-run home, but even the best machines can run into problems occasionally. The Beko washing machine is no different, and an E13 error code can really throw you for a loop. Luckily, there are a few things you can try to get your Beko washing machine running smoothly once again! 

The E13 error code is a drain error code and is specifically related to the pump. It's most commonly caused by the washer not draining correctly, either because the filter is clogged, or because the drain hose is obstructed. Before attempting any troubleshooting, it's important to reset the washing machine by unplugging it.

Once the machine has been reset, the next step is to check the filter. It is usually located at the bottom-front or back of the washer and can be easily accessed by removing the kick plate or back cover. Check to see if the filter is clogged up with fibers or some other kind of debris. If it is, clear it out using a screwdriver and moving any stuck debris.

Next, inspect the drain hose and make sure it is not obstructed. If it is blocked, carefully remove whatâ€™s blocking it. If you are using an extension hose to connect the drain hose to the drainage system, make sure the hose isn't untwisted or otherwise not properly connected. Once the drain hose is unblocked, reset the washing machine and run a test cycle.

The E13 error code is a source of annoyance, but with a few simple steps, you can easily resolve the issue --no problem is too big to tackle! If you're still having trouble, be sure to consult the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for more information.
