## Filling Your Glass From the Biggest Jug of Water: Here's How
There's no denying that the struggle is real when it comes to ensuring that your glass is always full. Those who find themselves short on time are often short on water too, but don't worry – getting the biggest jug of water on the market and adding it to your home is the first step towards solving your problem.

For those of us who love having our glass full of water, there are plenty of ways you can increase the likelihood of our drinking water without having to top up each and every time. Here are some tips for fitting more water into your glass: 

* Switch to larger glasses: If you’re using a glass or cup that’s on the size of a wine glass, then you’ll be better off switching to a larger set of glasses. They’re able to hold more water than the smaller variety. 

* Find a big jug of water: This tip is not exactly rocket science; finding the biggest jug of water is an easy way to add more water to your glass each time. It's important to note that while bigger jugs typically contain more water, they can also be expensive.

* Use a filter: If you’re worried about the quality of tap water, then getting yourself a filter jug is a great way to ensure that your water is as pure as possible. They’re also great value for money.

* Add ice: Ice is a great way to make sure your water stays cold and not only that, it also adds volume. This is because the ice will take up space in the glass, leaving you with more room for water.

There’s no denying that the biggest jug of water is the ideal choice for those of us who want our glass to always be full. It might be a bit more expensive than other types of water but it will ensure that you never run out of water. Additionally, it also gives you peace of mind that the water you're drinking is safe and of the highest quality. 

By following these tips, you can ensure that your glass is always full and that the water you’re drinking is of the highest quality.
