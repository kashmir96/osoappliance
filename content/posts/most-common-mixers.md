Mixers are an important part of making drinks, and there are a variety of mixers available to choose from. Knowing which mixers work best in different drinks can be tricky, so it’s helpful to have a basic understanding of the most common types. Here’s a quick rundown of the most popular mixers:

Soda Water: Also known as carbonated water or club soda, this mixer is made from water that has been artificially charged with carbon dioxide gas. It adds bubbles and fizziness to cocktails and is often used as a substitute for tonic water. Popular brands include Schweppes or Fever Tree.

Cola: Cola is one of the oldest and most popular soft drinks in America and its classic flavor works well in many cocktails. It adds sweetness and depth to drinks, making it an ideal mixer for whiskey-based cocktails like the Whiskey Coke or classic Rum & Coke. Popular brands include Coca-Cola or Pepsi. 

Ginger Ale: Ginger ale is an ale-style beer that has been flavored with ginger extract, giving it its distinct flavor profile. Its spiciness pairs well with whiskey and other spirits, making it great for creating flavorful concoctions like the Moscow Mule or Whiskey Ginger Ale Cooler. Popular brands include Canada Dry or Schweppes Ginger Ale. 

Tonic Water: Tonic water is made from carbonated water combined with quinine (a bitter compound) which gives it its unique taste profile - tartness with slight bitterness - that pairs perfectly with gin in cocktails like the Gin & Tonic or Vodka Tonic. Popular brands include Fever Tree or Schweppes Tonic Water. 

Lemonade: Lemonade is another classic drink that makes a great mixer for vodka-based drinks like Vodka Lemonades or Margaritas as well as whiskey concoctions like Whiskey Sours and Jack & Cokes! Popular brands include Minute Maid Lemonade or Country Time Lemonade Mix (which comes both sweetened and unsweetened). 

Orange Juice: Orange juice is perhaps one of the most versatile mixers out there – while often enjoyed simply on its own over ice, orange juice also makes a great addition to many cocktails such as Screwdrivers (vodka + orange juice), Tequila Sunrises (tequila + orange juice + grenadine) ,and Mimosas (champagne + orange juice). Popular brands include Tropicana Orange Juice or Simply Orange Juice!

Appliances for making mixers can also be found online and in stores. Popular brands include SodaStream and Drinkmate, both of which allow you to make your own mixers with the press of a button.

Mixers are an essential part of any home bar, so it’s important to understand the different types available and how they work best in different drinks. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to create any cocktail you can dream up – cheers!
