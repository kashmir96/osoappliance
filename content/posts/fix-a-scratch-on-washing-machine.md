# Fix a scratch on washing machine

Has a scratch on your washing machine been bothering you? Not only does it look unsightly, but it can also weaken the integrity of the machine. Fortunately, fixing a scratch on a washing machine isn't too difficult. Here is a step-by-step guide that can help you get your washing machine back to looking good and functioning well.

1. Start by cleaning the surrounding area of the scratch. Use a soft cloth and some mild detergent to wipe away any dirt or debris that may have collected around the impaired area of the washer.

2. Examine the size and shape of the scratch carefully so you can determine what kind of material you need to fix it with. Depending on how deep and wide the scratch is, you may need to use something like epoxy putty or stainless steel patches. If there are any sharp edges present in or around the scratched area, use sandpaper to file them down before continuing with any repair work.

3. Apply an adhesive bonding compound along both sides of the scratch substrate (the material making up your washer). Make sure that it’s evenly spread out in order for it to provide sufficient bonding strength upon curing later on in this process. Let this adhesive dry for about 24 hours so that it becomes fully cured before moving onto any further steps with repair work for your washer’s scratched surface issue(s). Doing this will ensure that whatever material is used next will adhere properly when placed overtop later on down in our process below… 

4. Once everything has been dried thoroughly from our previous preparation steps above, apply whatever type of patching material (epoxy putty/stainless steel patches etc.) chosen earlier onto both sides of our washer surface's scratched substrate using an applicator tool or brush as needed depending upon what type/form these materials are being applied with here…  Let this patching material fully cure overnight before attempting to move onto any other working tasks/steps within our overall repair process here as well please!  This curing time frame is necessary for ensuring optimal strength & long-term durability for all applications involved throughout… 

5. Finally, the last step you'll need to take is to buff out any rough edges that were created during the repair job so that it looks and feels as seamless as possible. You can do this using a damp cloth and some fine-grit sandpaper. Once everything has been buffed out properly, wipe away any leftover dust or debris with a slightly damp rag before giving your washer one final look-over and call it good! 

By following these steps carefully, your washing machine should be looking like new in no time! With proper care and maintenance going forward, you can ensure that its structural integrity remains unaffected and enjoy many more years of reliable performance from your washing machine.
