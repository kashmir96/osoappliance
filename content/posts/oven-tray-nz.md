When it comes to baking, the oven tray you use is just as important as the ingredients you put into your dish. Whether you’re roasting vegetables or baking a cake, having the right oven tray can make all the difference. Here in New Zealand, we have a variety of oven trays available to suit all sorts of cooking needs. 

To get started, it’s important to think about what kind of food you plan on cooking and what size oven tray will work best for your needs. If you’re looking for something that can handle larger dishes such as casseroles or roasts, then an aluminium shallow roasting pan with a wire rack is an ideal choice. These are great for creating even heat distribution in the oven and allowing air flow around the food so it cooks evenly. 

For smaller dishes such as biscuits or cakes, non-stick baking trays are a great option and come in plenty of different shapes and sizes. Non-stick trays are perfect for baking because they help ensure that your baked goods don’t stick to the tray when they’re cooked. Plus, they’re easy to clean so there's no need to scrub them after use! 

If you plan on doing some grilling or broiling then an aluminium foil drip pan may be more suitable – these are designed to catch any grease or fat that drips off during cooking so it doesn't end up on your oven floor! You can also get multi-use trays which come with perforations that let fat drain away while still allowing heat circulation around your food – perfect if you plan on doing some combination cooking! 

Finally, something that many people overlook is using silicone mats instead of parchment paper when lining their trays before baking. Silicone mats are reusable which helps reduce paper waste and provides better insulation against high temperatures than parchment paper does – making them ideal for those who like their baked goodies extra crispy! 

So no matter what kind of dish you plan on making in your oven, there is definitely an oven tray available here in New Zealand that will help make your culinary creations shine!
