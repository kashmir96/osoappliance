## Is Running the Dishwasher Half Full Wasteful?
Running a dishwasher half full may seem a bit “wasteful”, but it can actually be quite economical when taking time and energy into consideration. Though there are a few factors to consider, proper usage of the dishwasher can help streamline the process and save both time and energy.

The cost of using the dishwasher and the cost of hand washing really depends on your water and electricity costs. Generally, hand washing uses more water than running a full dishwasher; however, running an empty or partially full dishwasher can waste a great deal of energy. The key to economical and environmentally friendly dishwasher usage is to pay attention to the load size and to ensure the dishwasher settings are efficient. 

Dishwasher usage should ensure both full and efficient loads. Full dishwashers use less water and more energy efficient settings can be adjusted depending on the types of dishes being washed. Heat sensors detect how dirty the water is during the cycle and adjust the number of rinsing and heating phases accordingly. This helps to maximize the energy efficiency of each cycle. 

Instead of washing just a few dishes by hand, it can be more efficient to gather them up and run a full load in the dishwasher. This helps to make sure that the most energy efficient settings are used, avoiding an unnecessary expense on energy and electricity. 

Overall, when running the dishwasher, make sure that the load is full and efficient. When already washing the dishes, consider the cost of running the empty dishwasher versus filling it up for a more economical cycle. By understanding how to maximize the usage of the dishwasher, it is possible to reduce the energy and water costs associated with running the dishwasher.
