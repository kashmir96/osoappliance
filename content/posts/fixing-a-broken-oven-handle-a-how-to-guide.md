## Fixing A Damaged Oven Handle

No one wants to have to deal with a broken oven handle. But, when something like this happens, it’s important to know how to fix it quickly. Not only will it save time, but it will also save you money that you’d otherwise have to spend on getting a new oven or getting a professional to fix it.

The first thing to consider when trying to fix a broken oven handle is to determine what type of material it is made of. Generally, most handles are made of metal, plastic or ceramic. Each material requires a different approach for patching up the body.

If the handle is made of plastic, the most effective way to fix the problem is to use super glue or a similar adhesive. The first step is to clean off the broken pieces using a cloth. Once the pieces have been cleaned, make sure to apply a generous amount of the glue to the inside of the handle. Allow time for the adhesive to dry before attempting to attach the pieces together.

If the handle is made of metal, it is best to use a pair of pliers and some screws. First, you should use the pliers to shape the broken sides of the handle in order to fit them together. Next, use the screws to hold the sides together and provide a secure seal.

If the handle is made of ceramic, it may be necessary to use epoxy glue. As with the other materials, make sure to clean off the broken pieces and apply the glue to both sides. Additionally, provide extra support by placing some pieces of cloth or paper between the halves or by wrapping a small band around the handle.

No matter what handle material you have, it is important to ensure the security of the handle before attempting to use the oven. Furthermore, if you’re not feeling confident in your ability to fix the handle, you may need to consult a professional. 

In conclusion, fixing a broken oven handle can be a tricky task. Even so, it’s important to know the steps to take in order to properly complete the job. Before attempting to fix the handle yourself, be sure to consider the type of material, and then the appropriate steps on how to patch up the body. Lastly, if you ever feel like you’re in over your head, don’t hesitate to consult a professional and get the job done right.
