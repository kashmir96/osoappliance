If you're looking for a way to make ironing easier, then look no further than your washing machine! Washing machines with easy iron settings can help reduce the time spent ironing clothes and save you energy too. So, what is easy iron and how does it work? 

Easy iron is a feature on some washing machines which helps reduce creases in your clothes. It works by adding extra water during the rinse cycle of a wash, which helps to relax the fibres in clothing. This reduces the amount of effort needed when it comes to ironing as fewer creases and wrinkles form during the drying cycle. The amount of water added during this rinse cycle will depend on your machine's setting but is usually around 10-20%. 

You can identify if your washing machine has an easy iron function by checking its settings or user manual. Many modern models come with this feature as standard but if your washer doesn't then you may want to consider investing in one that does. 

When using an easy iron setting it's important to pay attention to the type of fabric being washed as some fabrics don't respond well to additional water being added during the rinse cycle. For example, silk should not be washed on an easy iron setting as this could damage its texture and weaken its fibres over time. To get the best results with any fabric always check the care label before starting a wash cycle with an easy iron setting enabled. 

Overall, using an easyiron setting can save you time when it comes to laundry day chores such as washing and drying clothes â€“ leaving more time for other tasks!
