A range hood is one of the most important pieces of kitchen equipment you can buy. It is an essential part of keeping your kitchen clean and safe, as it removes smoke, steam and odors from cooking. When shopping for a range hood, one of the first things to consider is size. The size you need depends on your cooking style and the size of your stovetop or cooktop. Here’s a quick guide to help you understand what size range hood will work best in your kitchen: 

Small Kitchens – For smaller kitchens with limited space, such as studio apartments and condos, a wall-mounted range hood with a smaller width (20-30 inches) will be adequate for most everyday cooking needs. This type of range hood is ideal for kitchens with minimal counter space as it takes up very little room when installed properly against the wall above the stovetop or cooktop. 

Medium Kitchens – For medium-sized kitchens that feature larger stoves or cooktops (36 inches or more), it’s best to invest in a larger 30-inch island mount range hood that hangs from the ceiling over your stovetop or cooktop. Island mount hoods provide excellent coverage over large areas and are great at capturing smoke, steam and odors before they have time to spread throughout your home. 

Large Kitchens – For larger kitchens that feature professional grade stoves/cooktops (48 inches or more), investing in an even bigger 36-inch island mount model is recommended. These types of models offer superior coverage compared to their smaller counterparts so they are able to capture more smoke and steam than other models on the market today. 

 No matter what type of kitchen you have, investing in a quality range hood will ensure that your home stays free from dangerous fumes while also helping keep air circulating properly throughout all areas in your house!
