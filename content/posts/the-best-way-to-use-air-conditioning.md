Using your air conditioning system correctly is essential to keeping your home comfortable, reducing energy costs, and prolonging the life of the system. Here are some tips on how to use air conditioning in the most effective way:

1. Keep temperatures moderate: Setting the temperature too low can cause your air conditioner to work harder than necessary and increase energy costs. Try to keep temperatures at a moderate level of between 78°F and 80°F when you’re home and active, or 82°F when you’re away or sleeping.

2. Use fans for extra cooling: Fans can help circulate cool air throughout your home more efficiently than just running an air conditioner alone. Utilizing ceiling fans or portable units can help provide additional cooling without having to run the AC at full blast all day long. 

3. Keep windows closed during hot days: To keep cool air in and hot air out, be sure to close all windows while using your AC unit during peak hours (usually between 11am-4pm). This will also help reduce any outdoor noise levels that may interfere with comfort levels inside your home. 

4. Make sure filters are clean: Dirty or clogged filters will restrict airflow and cause the system to work harder than necessary which increases energy costs as well as wear-and-tear on the unit over time. Be sure to check filters regularly (at least once a month) and change them as needed for optimal performance levels from your AC unit. 

5. Schedule regular maintenance checks: Regular maintenance checks from a certified HVAC technician will ensure that all components of an AC system are functioning properly so that it runs efficiently throughout its lifespan with minimal repair needs down the road due to improper usage or lack of proper upkeep over time. 

Following these tips will help you use your air conditioning system more effectively, saving you money and energy in the long run. Be sure to contact a professional if you have any questions or concerns about your AC unit or need any additional help with using it correctly.
