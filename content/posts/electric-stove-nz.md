The electric stove has become a popular choice for many New Zealand households in recent years, due to its energy efficiency and convenience. An electric stove is powered by electricity, which means you don’t need to worry about running out of gas, or having to constantly fill up your tank. This also makes an electric stove much more cost effective than other options. 

Electric stoves are also incredibly easy to use and maintain, as they require no additional maintenance other than regular cleaning. They work by heating up the coils on top of the stove, which then radiates heat that is used to cook food. This makes it much faster and easier to cook meals compared with other methods such as using a gas stove or oven. 

Another great benefit of using an electric stove is that it is much safer than other options such as a gas stove. With an electric stove you don’t have to worry about any open flames or combustible gases being present in your kitchen. This also means that there is less of a risk of accidental fires occurring in your home due to a faulty appliance or improper installation. 

Lastly, electric stoves are very energy efficient compared with gas stoves and ovens, as they require less electricity per unit of cooking time than their counterparts do for the same cooked food items. This not only helps keep your electricity bills lower but also helps reduce the carbon footprint of your home's cooking activities significantly over time. 

Overall, electric stoves have become increasingly popular in New Zealand households due their convenience, affordability and safety benefits when compared with other options available on the market today
