## How Much is a Laundromat in NYC? 

Visiting New York City can often be an expensive venture, and one of the most common expenses that visitors may not account for is the cost of doing laundry. With hotels often charging exorbitant fees for simple services, it makes sense to look into other options like Laundromats. So what does it cost to do your own laundry in NYC? 

The actual cost of using a Laundmat varies from location to location and depends on the size of machines you use. Generally speaking, you can expect to pay $2-$4 per load for washers and $1-$2 per load for dryers. This means that washing a full load of laundry will likely run you anywhere from $4-$6, while drying a full load will likely run between $3-$5. Many locations also offer discounts when paying with cash or loyalty cards, so if you're planning on using the same spot multiple times throughout your stay it may be worth asking about this option. 

While using a Laundromat can work out cheaper than hotel services or having your clothes shipped home, there are some drawbacks - convenience being chief among them! It's not always easy to find a nearby Laundromat in an unfamiliar neighborhood, and carrying all those dirty clothes around can be quite inconvenient too! 

For travelers looking for an easier way to keep their wardrobe clean during their stay in NYC (without breaking the bank), appliance rentals could make all the difference!
