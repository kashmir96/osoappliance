## Troubleshooting Issues with Your Dishwasher
Having a broken dishwasher can be hassle and a strain on your regular household routine. Thankfully, many of the common problems with dishwashers can be solved by the homeowner without calling in a professional. 

### Symptom 1: Dishwasher Won't Start
If your dishwasher won’t start, it could be due to a blown fuse or tripped circuit. To check this, locate the circuit breaker and reset it. Then try and start the dishwasher again. 

It could also be that the control board is locked or stuck, in which case you’ll need to press and hold the start button for about a minute. This is a reset sequence for many brands and should unlock the board.

### Symptom 2: Dishwasher Not Cleaning Properly
If your dishes don’t seem to be getting clean, the issue could be clogged filters or nozzles. Check these and clean as necessary according to your dishwasher’s instructions. 

It’s also worth trying some dishwasher cleaner. This can help dissolve any built-up food particles and soap scum that might be clogging up your dishwasher or inhibiting its cleaning performance. 

### Symptom 3: Dishwasher Making Noises
If your dishwasher is making strange noises, it’s likely a result of broken or destroyed filters. Check your machine’s documentation to find out more about these parts, and read up on how to replace them if necessary. 

You could also have an issue with the pump, which is a more difficult but not impossible fix. Before replacing the pump, it’s important to make sure that any hoses and parts that could be making noise are tight and not worn out..

Ultimately, checking and cleaning your dishwasher regularly can help prevent these kinds of issues.

### Summary 
Many of the most common problems with dishwashers can be solved at home with a bit of troubleshooting. This can save time and worry compared to calling in a professional. Of course, if the issue persists or you don't feel comfortable tackling the problem yourself, it's always best to call an appliance repair technician.

## Solving Common Problems with your Dishwasher

1. **What should I do if my dishwasher isn't draining?** There are many reasons why your dishwasher may not be draining. Common causes include a clogged drain line, a malfunctioning pump, or a worn seal. To troubleshoot the issue, make sure the rinse cycle is selected and the unit is powered on. Check to make sure the drain line is free of debris and that the drain pump is operating correctly. Make sure the door gasket is properly seated, and consider replacing the seal if it is aged or worn.

2. **How do I prevent dishes from spotting or filming?** Filming or spotting on dishes is usually caused by hard water or improperly diluted detergent. To prevent these issues from occurring, use detergent specifically designed for hard water and softened water, avoid over-dosing the detergent, and make sure the water entering the dishwasher is hot.

3. **What is the best way to load the dishwasher?** Loading your dishwasher correctly can ensure dishes come out clean. When loading dishes, make sure larger and bulkier items are placed towards the sides and back of the dishwasher and not in the middle of the rack. Plates and heavier items should be placed on the bottom rack, and most glasses and cups should fit comfortably on the top rack. Heavily soiled dishes should be placed facing the center.

4. **What should I do if dishes are not getting clean?** If your dishes are not coming out clean, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue. Make sure there is no food blocking the spray arms and that the proper rinse cycle is selected. Ensure that detergent is being used and that it is not expired, and check to make sure the door gasket is seated properly. Consider running a short cycle with vinegar to dissolve and remove any built-up residues or lime deposits.

5. **How do I know when it is time to replace the dishwasher?** Generally, the average dishwasher has a lifespan of 10-12 years, depending on brand. If your dishwasher is getting older, look for signs that it needs to be replaced. This includes strange noises during the wash cycle, leaking, poor water pressure, or mechanical failures such as pumps, valves, and seals. If you are noticing any of these issues, it may be time to consider getting a new dishwasher.
