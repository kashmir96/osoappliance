When it comes to cleaning your stove, it’s important to know just when to do it. Not only will regular cleaning keep your stove looking its best, but it will also help ensure that you are cooking with a clean surface. Some of the common signs that you need to clean your stove include grease and food build-up on the burners, a greasy film on the control knobs and buttons, burned-on food in the oven cavity, and spills on the cooktop.

If you notice any of these signs of dirt and grime on your stove, it’s time for a good cleaning. Regular maintenance is key for keeping your stove looking great and functioning properly. Here are a few tips for when to clean your stove:

• After every use: Make sure to wipe up spills right away as they happen with a paper towel or damp cloth. This will help prevent them from hardening or staining over time.

• Every few weeks: You should give your entire stove top (including the knobs) a thorough scrubbing every few weeks with an all-purpose cleaner or degreaser such as Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner or Grease Relief All Purpose Degreaser & Cleaner. Make sure you read all labels before using any product on surfaces that come into contact with food. 

• Every month: For an even deeper clean, use an abrasive cleaner like Bon Ami Powder Cleanser once a month for tough stains or grease build-up in the oven cavity and around burners. 

• Once per season: It’s also important to take apart components like removable grates or drip pans so they can be washed separately in warm soapy water at least once per season (more often if needed). 
 
By following these tips, you can make sure that your stove is always clean and ready for use!
