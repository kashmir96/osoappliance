## 10 Kitchen Safety Rules to Keep You and Yours Safe

In a kitchen full of sharp utensils, hot surfaces and slippery floors, preparing meals and entertaining can fall by the wayside if safety isn’t taken seriously. Knowing and observing 10 kitchen safety rules will help make the kitchen an enjoyable place to cook and enjoy great food without worry or risk. 

1. Before cooking, always read the recipe. Knowing the ingredients and preparation steps helps prevent burning, boiling over or missing a crucial step.

2. Dress appropriately; no loose clothing, no jewellery and always wear shoes. Clothing such as long skirts and scarves may get caught in the kitchen appliances and jewellery can melt against a hot surface or catch on the cutting board.

3. Use the right utensil for the job. Don’t attempt to mix a cake with a standard kitchen knife, and don’t use a butter knife to slice vegetables.

4. Use non-slip mats in the kitchen to reduce the risk of slips and falls.

5. Make sure all utensils, such as knives and peelers, remain sharp and in good condition to avoid any inadvertent injuries.

6. Place hot pans and dishes away from the edges of countertops to prevent any hit and burn accidents.

7. Cook and store food safely to reduce the risk of food poisoning. Refrigerate Perishables immediately, and always check the temperature with a food thermometer.

8. Make sure all fire alarms installed in the kitchen are in proper working order.

9. Contact authorities if you detect a gas leak in your kitchen.

10. In the event of an emergency, know where the fire extinguisher and first aid kit are located.

These 10 kitchen safety rules ensure that the kitchen remains a safe and enjoyable place so everyone can relax and enjoy the experience of preparing meals and entertaining. Investing in modern kitchen appliances such as top-of-the-line refrigerators, electric pressure cookers and outdoor grills that are designed with safety aspects in mind is another easy way to keep the kitchen safe while still being able to enjoy delicious meals.
