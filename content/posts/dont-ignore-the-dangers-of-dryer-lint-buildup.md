## Don't Neglect the Risks of Dryer Lint Accrual

It's easy to put off cleaning out your dryer lint trap every week, but this seemingly small task can have some serious consequences. Dryer lint buildup can lead to wasted energy, increased fire risk, and unnecessary spending. Though not all damage is always apparent, it’s important to make sure you don’t neglect the dangers that come with neglecting to clean out the lint trap frequently.

First and foremost, it’s important to note that dryer lint build up increases your dryer’s energy usage. When lint accumulates quickly, air is not able to properly circulate through the dryer, causing it to work twice as hard – not only putting a strain on the dryer, but also your wallet. In addition, a clogged lint trap can lead to unnecessary repairs, which leads to an even higher energy bill and lost time.

Perhaps more important than wasted energy, a large amount of dryer lint buildup can create an increased risk of a fire. Because lint is highly combustible and can be a fuel source for fires, it’s important to stay vigilant with cleaning out the lint traps, especially if you leave your dryer running for an extended period of time. Neglecting to clean the lint trap can result in an accumulation of dust and oils that can be slowly ignited by the dryer’s heat, causing a fire.

It’s important to both clean out the lint trap after every cycle and other parts of the dryer on a semi-frequent basis in order to ensure your safety and that your dryer doesn’t suffer from energy waste and excessive repairs. If you want to ensure that your dryer stays in the best shape possible, then we recommend that you check out our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to find one that fits your budget and needs.
