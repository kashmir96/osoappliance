## Renting Appliances Offers Financial and Convenience Benefits

Major household appliances – refrigerators, washers and dryers, ovens and ranges - can have a significant impact on our finances. The cost of replacing malfunctioning appliances can be quite high, especially if the existing appliances are not covered by a warranty.

Renting appliances can offer a convenient solution, providing access to name-brand, quality products without the need to make a large purchase up front. This can help keep monthly finances under control while allowing access to the latest appliance options and a broad range of styles.

In addition, renting offers the potential for more flexible financing options. Renting gives more control and can be adjustable, changing the terms according to changing needs or budget constraints. Plus, some appliance rental companies may even offer lease-to-own options.

Not only does renting offer financial and convenience benefits, but it can also provide additional peace of mind. Renters benefit from warranty coverage, as well as extended hardware replacement policies, so renters are able to rely on the life of their appliances over the long-term, even if a breakdown ensues.

Another advantage to appliance rental is the fact that renters no longer need to worry about costly repairs due to unexpected breakdowns. If a rented appliance malfunctions, repair or replacement is taken care of by the rental company.

Renting appliances can be a great way to get access to all of the latest options without the financial burden of a major household appliance purchase. By offering more flexible payment plans and better protection against unexpected breakdowns, renting appliances can be a great option for renters looking for convenience and control over their monthly costs.
