If you're looking for a reliable oven that offers excellent cooking performance and features, look no further than Whirlpool. This popular brand has a great selection of ovens that offer many different features and styles to suit your needs. One of the features you'll find on many of their models is the broiler.

The broiler is an important part of any oven, as it allows you to cook food quickly and evenly. In short, it turns the top heating element into a powerful heat source, similar to a grill or open flame. When used properly, the broiler can cook food in minutes that would otherwise take much longer with traditional baking methods.

On Whirlpool ovens, the broiler is usually found at the top of the cavity under the control panel or above the main door on some models. To use it, simply turn on the broiler by pushing in and turning the knob located either on top of or below the control panel (depending on model). Once activated, adjust your desired temperature using either a dial or digital display (again depending on model). Place your food in an appropriate dish and place it directly under or close to where your heat source is coming from – usually near the center of your oven’s roof. Then let it do its work!

Whirlpool ovens offer great cooking performance with their versatile features like their built-in broilers. With this feature alone you can easily prepare delicious meals faster than ever before! Whether you’re roasting vegetables or grilling burgers, make sure to get familiar with this useful feature so you can make full use out of your Whirlpool oven.
