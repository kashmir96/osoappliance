## Caring for Electric Laundry Appliances for a Spotless Result 
Keeping laundry clean and hygienic requires consistent and proper care for your electric laundry appliances. Small steps and attention to detail can help extend the life of your electric laundry appliances as well as help keep your garments as clean as possible. 

Before use, be sure to carefully read the user’s manual of your electric laundry appliance. Some tips on proper care and maintenance may be included in the manual. It’s always a good idea to become familiar with your appliances’ bells and whistles. Knowing your electric laundry appliance may also help identify potential problems before they become serious.

Every time you switch on your electric laundry appliance, it’s important to give it a thorough cleaning. Wiping away any residue left over from the last usage or removing lint in between nooks or around the drum or heating coil is important for its efficiency and to extend its life. Doing this at least once a month prevents dust, dirt and lint build-up, which can cause damage to your appliance and its overall performance. 

If you own an electric dryer, the lint filter requires special attention. Lint and dust blocks the vents, dampers and filters, and should be cleaned before and after every usage for maximum efficiency and proper air circulation. All electric dryers require exterior vent cleaning too, so be sure to check instructions in the user’s manual that may require you to use a vacuum cleaner or order and combine specific cleaning supplies.

It may also be necessary to lubricate some parts of your electric laundry appliance, such as the spinning shafts, the trunnion washer, the drum and agitator, depending on the type and model of your electric laundry appliance. Refer to your user’s manual to identify which parts need lubrication and the recommended lubrication type or frequency.

For electric laundry appliances with damaged cords or plugs, it’s important to have them repaired or replaced by a professional appliance repair technician. We recommend you count on our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for expert repair and maintenance of your electric laundry appliances.
