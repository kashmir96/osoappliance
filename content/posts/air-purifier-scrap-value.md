When it comes to air purifier technology, one thing that is often overlooked is the scrap value of a used air purifier. Although air purifiers are not typically thought of as an item with any real monetary value, the truth is that there are a number of different ways to make money from an old or used air purifier.

The most common way to take advantage of the scrap value of a used air purifier is by selling it for parts. Air purifiers contain numerous components that can be removed and sold individually, such as fans, filters, motors, and other assorted parts. If you have access to the right tools and resources for dismantling the unit safely, then you can often make more money selling individual parts than selling the entire machine as one whole unit. This can be especially beneficial if you have multiple units to sell in order to maximize your profits. 

Another potential source of income from an old or used air purifier is recycling it for scrap metal. Air purifiers are built using various metals such as aluminum and steel which can be recycled at recycling centers for cash payments per pound. The exact amount paid depends on current market rates but typically ranges between $0.05 and $0.50 per pound depending on your location and what materials are present in your particular unit(s). 

Finally, some individuals choose to donate their old or used air purifiers for charitable causes or organizations in need. Many charities accept donations of goods like this which they then use either directly or sell them on behalf of their cause in order to generate funds or provide goods/services directly from their organization's coffers instead of relying solely upon donations from generous benefactors. Donating a unit such as an air purifier might not bring you any direct monetary gain but knowing that your donation has gone towards helping those less fortunate than yourself certainly does carry its own rewards! 

Overall, although an old or used air purifier may not seem like it has much value beyond its intended use at first glance - there are actually quite a few ways one could potentially benefit financially by taking advantage of its scrap value! Whether you decide to sell individual parts online via classifieds sites like Craigslist; recycle it for cash at local recycling centers; donate it toward worthy causes; or any other creative ideas you may come up with - understanding how valuable these units really can be will help ensure that they don’t just get discarded after they’ve been replaced with newer models!
