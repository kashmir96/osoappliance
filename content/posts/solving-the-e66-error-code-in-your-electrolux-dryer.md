## Fixing the E66 Error Code on an Electrolux Dryer
Have you encountered the E66error code when using your Electrolux Dryer? This error code can throw you into a panic, but can usually be resolved fairly easily. In this article, we'll break down what you need to do when you come across this code while using your dryer. 

The E66 error code indicates that there's an issue with the motor speed control. This means that internal components aren't working as they should, either because they've become too warm or require additional lubrication. The motor is responsible for turning tumbling drum, ensuring clothes are evenly heat circulated, and drying your items.

When this error code is displayed, the first step is to unplug the dryer from the wall and let it sit for roughly 30 minutes. This gives the internal components the opportunity to cool down and operate properly again. After 30 minutes has passed, plug the dryer back into the wall and press the “start” button. If the error code doesn't display, you're in good shape. 

If, however, you find that the E66 code is still showing, you should investigate further. Starting with a visual inspection, a few things can be checked to help save time: 
- Check the vents, lint reservoir and filter are clean and unobstructed
- Check that the motor is properly lubricated
- Check that all the wires and terminal blocks are securely connected

If all these components check out and the error code remains, next check the motor thermistor and motor speed control. If these components need to be replaced, it's recommended that you call a technician.

An Electrolux dryer displaying an E66 error code can be alarms, but that doesn't mean it's the end of the world. A few simple steps can get everything back on track and drying your clothes again. If these steps don't do the trick, it's time to call in the professionals for additional help.
