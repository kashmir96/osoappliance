## Get Your Hair Dryer Working Quickly with These Troubleshooting Solutions

Having a bad hair day due to your hair dryer not working? Don’t worry, you don’t have to call an expensive technician just yet. There are a few simple ways to troubleshoot and repair your hair dryer, so you can get back to styling and feeling your best.

Before you throw out your old dryer, start by checking the plug, cord, and switch. Look for signs of damage like frayed cord wires. If the plug is not properly connected to the outlet, then this is an easy fix that may get your dryer running again. Also, check the switch and make sure it is set to the correct setting.

If the plug and switch are functioning properly, double check the fuse box or reset the circuit breaker (if you're experiencing a trip to the fuse). If the fuse has been tripped, then this could be the reason your dryer isn’t working. Resetting the circuit breaker or replacing the fuse will help you get your hair dryer running again. 

If you’ve gone through all of these steps, yet your dryer still isn’t working, it’s possible that it may need more extensive repairs that should be handled by a professional. Our directory of appliance repair technicians is the perfect place to start when looking for an experienced specialist to get your hair dryer working properly again.
