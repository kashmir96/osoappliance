## Keep On Going Despite Navien E12 Error
Navien products are some of the most reliable and efficient energy-saving systems you can buy. Despite their impressive engineering, there's one issue you might face as a Navien user: the dreaded E12 error code. Don't panic - keep reading to find out what it is and how to troubleshoot it.

Navien E12 error occurs in the control board when it's unable to recognize the necessary internal components. It's important to note that this error is only found in mini-heater units, not in full-size heaters or boilers. It's very common in Navien systems that use a 118mm inducer. 

Regardless, once you encounter the Navien E12 error, the first thing you should do is reset the unit by turning off the power and waiting a few minutes to turn it back on. If that doesn't do the trick, then it's time to dig deeper and investigate what's causing the problem. Here are some of the possible solutions:

1. Check the wiring connections of the inducer motor, making sure they’re securely fastened and the power cord is connected. 
2. Inspect the inducer motor for any signs of wear, such as holes in the housing or in the internal components. 
3. Remove and reinstall the inducer motor to make sure it’s properly seated. 
4. Clean out any dust or debris from the inducer motor. 
5. If the inducer motor isn’t functioning properly, you might need to replace it.

In some cases, you may need to hire a certified Navien technician to diagnose and repair the issue. It’s important to do this as soon as possible so that you don’t risk damaging your system further.
