## Get The Most Out of Scrapping Your Washing Machine in NZ

Often when you replace a household appliance like a washing machine, it may seem like you have no use for the old one. However, in many cases you can receive scrap value for it, allowing you to recover some of the cost of your new purchase. Scrapping a washing machine in New Zealand is easy and rewarding, and often will take up a lot less time and effort than other methods of disposal.

When scrapping a washing machine in New Zealand, the main thing to do is to separate the parts that have recyclable value and can be sold. Typically these components are made of metal and can be sold to electronics recyclers who specialize in recovering these materials. Depending on the condition of the machine, you may be able to receive more or less money. Additionally, if you know the model of the washing machine, you may be able to target recyclers who specialize in specific makes and models which could help you maximize the amount of scrap value you get.

When disposing of an old washing machine, it's also important to ensure that any hazardous materials are disposed of safely and responsibly. This includes any oil, gas, or chemicals that may be present in the machine. If you don't feel comfortable or competent enough to handle this safely, you should consider a professional service to do the job.

Scrapping a washing machine in New Zealand is a great way to maximize the return on your old machine and help the environment at the same time. Knowing the model of the machine, separating the recyclable components, and taking care to responsibly dispose of any hazardous materials are all key steps in the process.

If you're looking to replace your washing machine, don't miss out on this opportunity to get the most out of your old one. To learn more about getting the most out of your appliances in general, take a look at our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
