Are you in the market for a new hair dryer? If so, you may have heard of Consumer NZ, an independent consumer research organization dedicated to helping New Zealanders make informed buying decisions. In this blog, we’ll be taking a look at some of the reviews from Consumer NZ on popular hair dryers.

The first model we’ll discuss is the Vidal Sassoon VS500A Hair Dryer. This model is one of the most popular models on Consumer NZ, with users giving it 4 out of 5 stars overall. Customers praised the lightweight design and powerful motor which provides quick drying times and even heat distribution throughout their hair. Many also noted that this model has an easy-to-use control panel which makes it simple to adjust settings as needed. The only downside noted by some customers was that this dryer tends to get quite hot after prolonged use. 

Next up is the Philips HP8233/00 Hair Dryer which also received 4 out of 5 stars overall from customers on Consumer NZ. Customers praised this model for its powerful motor and even heat distribution as well as its range of attachments which make styling easier than ever before. Some customers did note that they experienced some difficulty when using certain attachments but overall they were pleased with their purchase decision. 

Finally, there is the Remington D5000 Hair Dryer which was given 3 out of 5 stars by consumers on Consumer NZ. Customers found this model to be relatively lightweight and easy to use but many complained about its lack of power compared to other models in its price range as well as its tendency to overheat after prolonged use or when used on higher settings for extended periods of time. 

Overall, all three models have their own unique benefits and drawbacks so it’s important for shoppers to read through customer reviews before making a final decision about their purchase choice!
