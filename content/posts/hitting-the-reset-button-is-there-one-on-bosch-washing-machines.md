## Resetting Bosch Washing Machines

Are you having trouble with your Bosch washing machine? Have you considered if you need to hit the reset button? Resetting a Bosch washer can help to get it working properly again if it has been unplugged or if the power has gone out and you want to start it again. The process of resetting a Bosch washing machine varies depending on the model and type of appliance.

To reset some Bosch washing machines, you may need to press and hold the power button for five seconds, or press and hold both the Start/Pause and Power buttons together for five seconds. However, some of the newer models may have a Reset button on them instead. This will be a small button that you can press to reset the machine. On some of the newer models, you may see a small button marked Reset or just a circular button with a line across it.

If you cannot find the Reset button or if it fails to fix the problem, you can also try unplugging and then plugging the washing machine back in. This will usually reset the machine and if your power is still working, the machine should start running again. If the machine continues to fail, you should contact Bosch customer service for more help.

Resetting a Bosch washing machine can help resolve many issues that the machine may have. While the process can vary depending on the model, there are usually reset buttons located on newer machines, or you can unplug it and plug it back in to get the appliance working again. If none of these options work, you should contact a Bosch specialist for help.
