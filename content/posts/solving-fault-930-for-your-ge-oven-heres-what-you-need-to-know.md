## Unravelling Fault Code 930 for A GE Oven
Struggling to understand Fault Code 930 for your GE oven? With the right know-how it doesn't need to be a code you can't crack. Read on to find out what Fault 930 really means, and get your oven back up and running.

Fault 930 occurs when the oven temperature has gone too high. You'll need to reset the oven control to fix the issue. Depending on which model you have, the control could be an electronic touchpad, digital temperature control, or a dial knob.

To reset an electronic touchpad, first switch off the oven and unplug it. Next, press and hold down the 'Off' and 'Clear' buttons at the same time for several seconds until the fault code disappears. When the touchpad has been reset, it will return to its original factory settings. To adjust the oven settings simply switch it back on and enter the required settings.

For digital temperature controls, unplug the appliance and administer a 'residual heat' reset. To do this, press and hold 'Cancel' and 'Stop' for several seconds. Again the fault code will be erased and default settings will be returned. Re-enter the preferred settings before switching the oven on.

If you have a dial knob, switch off at the wall and leave it for 10 minutes, then switch it back on. Rewind the number to the lowest setting and reset the desired temperature. 

Fault 930 can be an annoyance for users of some GE ovens. But it can usually be solved quickly and easily. Following the above advice should get the oven temperature back in your control.
