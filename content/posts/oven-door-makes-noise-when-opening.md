Opening an oven door can be a noisy task. Many people might think that the noise is just part of the process, but it could actually be a sign of something more serious. This blog will discuss why your oven door may be making noise when you open it and what you can do to fix the issue.

The most common reason for an oven door making a loud noise when opened is due to worn out hinges or faulty springs. Over time, these components can become weak and cause the door to make a loud banging sound when pulled open or shut. In some cases, simply lubricating the hinges or replacing worn-out parts can help reduce this noise significantly. If lubrication doesn’t work, then it may be time to replace the hinges entirely or have them adjusted by a professional technician.

Another reason why your oven door might be making noises when opened is because of poor insulation in the walls around it. If there isn’t enough insulation between your kitchen walls and your oven, then heat from within your appliance could cause metal components inside to expand and contract rapidly as they heat up and cool down, thus creating loud banging noises during use. Adding extra insulation between these two surfaces should help reduce this problem significantly over time if not eliminate it altogether.

Finally, if all else fails, you may need to consider replacing some parts inside of your oven itself such as its heating elements or fan motor assembly in order to stop any further rattling from occurring when opening its door. As with any appliance repair job though, we highly recommend seeking assistance from a certified technician before attempting any DIY fixes on an electric stove as improper repairs could lead to serious injury or even death if not done properly!
