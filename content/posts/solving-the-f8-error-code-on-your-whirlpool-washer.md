## Diagnosing and Resolving the 'F8' Error Code in Your Whirlpool Washer

While it may be easy to assume the worst, an F8 error code on your Whirlpool washer usually has an easy-to-find solution. In fact, you may be able to troubleshoot and resolve the problem yourself in just a few minutes. This error code can be associated with a few different issues, but all with similar solutions. 

The F8 error code indicates a system suspension, meaning the washer may not be able to finish its cycle or complete the cleaning or draining process. This means the washer will stop running and will require troubleshooting. The F8 code can be caused by a power surge, a power outage, or incorrect settings being overloaded. 

It is important to unplug your washer for about 20 minutes before restarting it. This will allow the system to reset and completely reset the washer’s system. Restarting the washer will often resolve the issue, indicating an issue with a minor power surge or outage. 

You may also need to adjust the settings of your washer’s cycle to help the cycle finish. Reduce the size of the load, reduce the amount of detergent used, select a different cycle setting, or reduce the temperature of the water being used. Ensure all settings including soil level, temperature, and cycles are properly adjusted. 

If the error code is still present, consider checking your washer’s power cords, water hoses, and other possible obstructions. Make sure the power and water connections remain secure and free of kinks or blockages.

If you’ve completed all of these steps and are still unable to rectify the F8 error code on your Whirlpool washer, it may be time to call in a licensed technician.
