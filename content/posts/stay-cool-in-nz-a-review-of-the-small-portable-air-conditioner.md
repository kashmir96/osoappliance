## Keeping Cool in NZ with Portable Air Conditioners 
Are you living in NZ and experiencing the hot, summer months? Are you looking for an efficient way to keep your home cool without having to rely on a conventional air conditioning unit? A small portable air conditioner may be the perfect solution for you! In this blog we will review the features of this device and give our opinion on why it’s a great way to manage your home’s temperature in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. 

A small portable air conditioner is a compact and affordable way to cool your home. It is perfect for smaller areas or those who don’t have room for a large and bulky window unit or split system air conditioning. The device works by rapidly cooling down a room, while also being able to operate in fan mode to provide relief during humid days. It is also extremely quiet and won’t disrupt your peace at night. One of the main advantages of this device is that it is much more cost effective to run than a traditional AC unit. The compact size ensures that they are easy to move between rooms, and they can be safely used on wooden or tiled floors.

The portable air conditioners on the NZ market come in a range of sizes suitable for most people’s needs. From small, 4.5kw units to larger, 8kw models, there is an option available for every budget. They are loaded with features such as a timer and dehumidifier setting, so you can manage the temperature of your home without having to constantly adjust it manually. The most energy-efficient models include a “smart mode”, which senses the temperature and adjusts the fan and cooling settings accordingly.

When it comes to the overall value for money, a small portable air conditioner presents an attractive solution. It is an affordable option for those who aren’t ready to commit to a long-term purchase or installation of a central AC unit, and it still keeps your home cool when the mercury starts rising. The latest models also come with a range of useful features, such as a timer and dehumidifier, to make them even more convenient and efficient. 

In conclusion, small portable air conditioners are a great way to keep your home cool during the hot summer months in NZ. They are an affordable option that can be quickly and easily installed, and they are much more cost effective to run than conventional air conditioning units. For those looking for a budget-friendly temperature control solution, a small portable air conditioner is definitely worth considering!
