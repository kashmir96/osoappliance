## Understanding the Roles of Copper in Heatpumps and Air Conditioners

When it comes to warm-summer climates and the energy efficiency of cooling appliances, copper is an important component to consider. Copper is used in heat pumps and air conditioners to transfer heat from inside the home to the outside atmosphere - but how? 

In both systems, copper tubing is the part of the appliance the heat can travel through and is often the conductor of heat transfer. Heat pumps use the tubing to transfer the heat outside of your unit. The heat is then pushed through the copper tubing by an outdoor fan and releases it into the outdoor environment. 

When it comes to air conditioners, copper tubing acts as the link between the evaporator and the condenser. This transfer of heat is what allows the air conditioner to cool the air inside your home. By forcing the hot air outside and cooling the air inside, your air conditioner is able to efficiently regulate the indoor climate.

Ultimately, copper is a key factor to consider when purchasing your next energy efficient cooling appliance. Its energy efficient conductivity makes it a major component of keeping cool during those hot summer months. 

Beyond that, other features to consider are appliance certifications, energy efficiency ratings, filter maintenance and brand reputation. To find the perfect appliance for your home, take a look at our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to learn more.
