## F51 Error Code: What to Know

If you ever find yourself encountering an F51 Error Code, odds are good that something isn't working right with your appliance. Knowing the signs and implications of an F51 Error Code can help get you quickly on the path to a fix.

First and foremost, it's important to note that the F51 Error Code is related to laundry machines—specifically, it's an indication that your washer is having difficulty rotating. Lower-level error codes provide additional details; if list as "F51 Motor Fail," for example, you know that you've been dealing with a motor problem.

Signs that you may have an F51 Error Code vary based on the specific machine model, manufacturer, and the nature of the issue; if your F51 Error Code comes from a failed motor, for example, you may notice a grinding or tapping noise even when your washer is idle. Additionally, some dryers which feature dual motors may become unbalanced and vibrate if one motor stops working properly.

When you encounter an F51 Error Code, you'll have three options: replace the motor yourself, replace the entire machine, or contact a qualified appliance repair technician. If you're experienced and have the right tools—and are able to source the right motor—you may be able to replace it yourself by removing a few components, disconnecting the power and water, and then swapping out the motor; this is generally recommended only for experienced DIY-ers with the proper tools, however, as improper installation may create additional damage and void any product warranty.

The other two options are much simpler: You can either replace the entire machine, or contact a qualified technician who can diagnose and resolve the issue for you. Our directory of appliance repair technicians can help to connect you with a qualified, trusted technician who can diagnose and resolve your appliance issue. 

In conclusion, an F51 Error Code can be a difficult issue to overcome. By understanding the nature of the error and implications, however, you can be sure to select the best option for resolving the problem in a timely and cost-effective manner. If you're looking for professional assistance, our directory of appliance repair technicians can help connect you with an experienced and qualified professional who can help you get your washer (and your laundry schedule) back on track.
