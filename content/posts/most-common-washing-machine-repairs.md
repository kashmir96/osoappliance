If you are a homeowner, you know how important it is to keep your appliances in working order. Washing machines are no exception. Unfortunately, like any appliance, washing machines can suffer from a variety of issues that require repairs or maintenance. To help you get familiar with some of the most common issues and their solutions, here is a blog about the most common washing machine repairs.

1) Won't Drain - If your washer won't drain properly it could be caused by a clogged drain line or a faulty pump motor. First check for any blockages in the drain line and if none are found then replace the pump motor as this is usually the cause when nothing else works.

2) Not Spinning - If your washer isn't spinning properly it could be due to several things such as an unbalanced load, worn out drive belt or worn out agitator bearings. To fix this issue first check for an unbalanced load and redistribute clothes more evenly if needed. Then check for any damage to the drive belt and replace if necessary and finally inspect the agitator bearings for signs of wear or damage and replace as needed. 

3) Leaking Water - Leaking water from your washer could be caused by several things such as broken seals around door gaskets, loose hoses or pipes coming from inlet valves, clogged water lines or loose connections on supply hoses. First inspect all seals around door gaskets for any cracks or tears that may allow water to escape then check all hoses connected to inlet valves for tightness and make sure there are no clogs present in water lines finally make sure all connections on supply hoses are secure and not leaking at fittings 

4) Not Filling Up With Water - If your washer isn't filling up with water then it could be caused by worn out float switch assembly, faulty timer control switch or faulty pressure switches which require replacing once identified as being defective 

Lastly check all hose connections leading into washer to ensure they're securely fastened so no leaks occur while machine is operating
