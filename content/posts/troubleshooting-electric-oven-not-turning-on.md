## Troubleshooting an Electric Oven That Won't Turn On

Baking your favorite meal is just not the same if your oven won’t turn on. If you’re having an issue getting your electric oven to turn on, don’t worry. It’s often an easy fix. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot your interesting situation.

Begin by inspecting the power cord to ensure it is connected firmly and that it is not frayed or damaged in any way. If it’s in good condition, check your circuit breakers to see if your oven is receiving electricity. As an extra precaution, try a different appliance in the same outlet to make sure electricity is running through the circulation. 

If the circuit breaker and power cord are in working order, the issue could be with the internal temperature controls. If your temperature control thermostat is set correctly, it is likely defective and needs to be replaced. 

Finally, check your manual and model number of your oven to see if any recalls have been issued. If a recall was issued, have it serviced immediately by a professional. 

Having trouble with your electric oven? Tried all of the above troubleshooting steps and still not working?
