## Repairing a Broken Dryer Knob

Dryer knobs often become loosened, cracked, or worn over the lifetime of the machine. Repairing a broken dryer knob is both simple and inexpensive and can restore your dryerâ€™s normal operation.

When examining a broken dryer knob, determine whether it can be repaired or needs to be replaced. If the knob is made of plastic, it is likely to be a candidate for repair. If the knob is made of metal, however, it may be too costly to repair or the circuit board may have been damaged, in which case the dryer has to be replaced.

Assuming your dryer knob is eligible for repair, it can be done in a few quick steps. Firstly, unscrew the knob, being careful not to damage any other buttons or wires connected to it. In some cases, the knob may be held in place with a hidden screw, so make sure to look for that. Then, take the remaining knob and unscrew it to reveal the inner workings. Be sure to identify any loose screws, gears, and connecting parts that may have been displaced over time. 

Next, carefully press all the relevant parts back into the mechanism, ensuring they fit firmly in place. Once that is done, reassemble the knob and reattach it to the dryer. If it appears to be working, test the knob by setting the correct temperature for the next cycle. If it works properly, then you have successfully repaired the broken dryer knob.
