Are you looking for the best ways to take care of your washing machine? If so, you’ve come to the right place. Taking good care of your washing machine is essential if you want it to last—as well as keep your clothes clean and fresh. Here are some of the best practices for keeping your washing machine in tip-top shape:

1. Clean out the lint filter after each use. Lint can build up in the filter over time and cause poor performance or even damage to interior components. To prevent this, make sure to regularly clean out the lint filter after each use.

2. Wash with cold water whenever possible. Washing with hot water may be more effective at removing dirt and grime from clothes, but it also puts a lot of strain on your washing machine's components—which can lead to premature wear and tear over time. To help preserve its lifespan, opt for cold water instead whenever possible!

3. Don't overload the washer drum with too many items of clothing at once. Not only will this make it more difficult for clothes to get properly cleaned, but it could also cause permanent damage to your washing machine's internal parts due to excessive strain being placed on them during a single cycle! So make sure not to overload it with too many items at once! 

4. Avoid using harsh chemicals when cleaning your washer drum or exterior surfaces of your washer—stick with mild detergents instead! Using harsh chemicals could damage both interior and exterior components of your washer over time if used regularly, so always opt for mild detergents instead whenever cleaning out either its drum or its external surfaces! 
 
5. Regularly check hoses and pipes for any signs of corrosion or wear & tear before going ahead with any wash cycles—you don't want these parts coming apart while in use as this could result in major problems down the line! Additionally, this is also a good opportunity for you to check if there are any leaks present which need addressing ASAP before continuing usage of your washer as well!. 

 following these best practices will ensure that you get maximum life span from your washing machine while also protecting it from incurring unnecessary damage due to improper usage techniques - so make sure not forget about them next time that you're giving thought about how best look after yours today!
