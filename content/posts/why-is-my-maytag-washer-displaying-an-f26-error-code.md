## Troubleshooting Maytag Washer F26 Error Code
If youâ€™re a Maytag washer owner, you may have come across an error code F26 during a wash cycle. This code can be confusing and one of the most commonly seen fault codes for Maytag washers. Fortunately, getting to the bottom of the problem is not difficult. Knowing the root cause of this code can help you troubleshoot your Maytag washer error F26 yourself.

When your Maytag washer displays an F26 error code, it means that there is a communication issue with the serial communication line between the main control board and the motor control board. The F26 error code alerts you that communication between the two boards is unsuccessful, but it does not necessarily mean that either one is defective. Generally, this error can be caused by a few different components; a broken wiring harness, water inlet valve, pressure switch, or the motor control board itself.

Follow these steps to troubleshoot the F26 Maytag washer error code:

1. Check the wiring between the two boards for shorts, cuts, or breaks.
2. Test the inlet valve for proper water flow and solenoid operation.
3. Check the pressure switch for proper operation.
4. Test the motor control board for any damage or defects.

If the wiring, valves, and motor control board appear to be in good condition, it is likely that the error code is due to the main control board. The main control board could be defective, not communicating properly, or the connection could have loosened. In this case, it is best to contact a professional appliance technician to make sure the issue is properly diagnosed and fixed. 

If you're experiencing an F26 error code while running your Maytag washer, there are troubleshooting steps you can follow to help you get to the bottom of the issue.
