## Don't Let F08 Error Code Stop Your Laundry - Whirlpool Washer Guide

Once in a while, your Whirlpool washer might hit a snag; such as an F08 error code. F08 error codes usually mean your Whirlpool washing machine has a problem with the water pressure switch and that is causing a stall in the circuit. Fortunately, with the right troubleshooting guide, you can figure out what is wrong and get your machine back to working order.

If you get an F08 error code on your Whirlpool washer, first unplug the machine and plug it back in 5 minutes later. This will reset the error code and you can try to run the machine again. If the F08 code is still present, try checking the pressure switch connection at the control board of the washing machine. If the connection looks properly secure, you might need to replace the pressure switch. Be sure to unplug the machine before beginning any sort of repair work in order to prevent any potential electrical shock.

The two main causes of an F08 error code are either a faulty water pressure switch, or the pressure hose is blocked up and the water is not able to fill the machine. If the latter is the case, you should inspect the pressure hose connection for any clogging from sediment, lint, and other dirt. You should also check other connections to the machine, such as at the inlet valve, hose connection, faucet, and inlet hose for any potential clogging.

Pressure switches can be a little tricky to replace and itâ€™s always best to consult with a professional when it comes to installing new parts. A qualified repair professional can help you source the right replacement part and will ensure it is installed correctly the first time.

You should always take the time to troubleshoot F08 error codes on your Whirlpool washer and make sure the machine is running properly. Finding the underlying cause of the error code will prevent other potential issues from occurring down the road and help keep your appliance working optimally for the longest time.
