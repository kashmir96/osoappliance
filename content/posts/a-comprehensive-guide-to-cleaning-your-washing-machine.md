## An Easy Way to Keep Your Washing Machine Clean

A clean and well-maintained washing machine is an essential part of the modern household. While it may seem like a daunting task to undertake, regularly cleaning your washing machine is an important maintenance practice that improves your machineâ€™s performance and lifespan. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you keep your washing machine clean, so you can better take care of your laundry needs. 

The first step in cleaning your washing machine is to remove any visible debris inside the drum or filters. This can be done using a damp cloth, a pair of tweezers, and a vacuum cleaner, if necessary. Cleaning the lint and fuzz accumulation from the drum and filters helps to prevent the buildup of bacteria and other particles. Additionally, it is important to remove and discard any items that get stuck in the machine, such as coins, buttons, or lint from clothes.

Once the excess debris is removed, it is important to disinfect your washing machine. Bleach is one of the most effective cleaners for removing dirt, odor, and bacteria from a washing machine. Start by filling the machine with hot water, then add one cup of bleach and let it soak for several hours before running a cycle. It is important to use caution when working with bleach, as it can be very damaging to surfaces or fabrics that come in contact with it.

Finally, if you want to optimize the cleaning of your washing machine, use a special washing machine cleaner to dissolve detergent deposits, remove odor, and deep clean the drum and hose. These cleaners are often sold in liquid form, or they come as sachets with a precise dosage. Follow the instructions provided by the cleaner manufacturer carefully in order to achieve the desired results.

Cleaning your washing machine on a regular basis helps to keep your machine working properly and prevents dirt and bacteria from accumulating inside it. While the process may seem daunting, it is worth the effort, as it will help extend the lifespan of your machine.
