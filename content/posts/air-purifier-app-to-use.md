An air purifier app is an application that allows users to monitor and control the quality of their indoor air. This app can be used to track the levels of airborne pollutants, including allergens such as dust mites, pet dander, mold spores and pollen. It can even provide real-time information about the air around you.

The air purifier apps usually come part in parcel with air purifier hardware, like a smart air purifier. Many air purifier apps allow you to monitor the quality of your indoor air, set up alerts for when the air is contaminated, and control the fan speed of your unit. With this app, you can easily keep track of your home’s air quality and make sure that it’s always clean and safe for everyone in the family.

The app will first detect airborne pollutants in your home by analyzing their size, shape and concentration. Then it will analyze the data from sensors to determine if there is a need to adjust the settings on your smart air purifier. The app can also alert you to potential health risks so that you can take appropriate action before the air becomes too contaminated.

Additionally, an air purifier app may also be able to provide detailed information about different types of pollutants present in your home environment. Some apps are even capable of providing recommendations on how to reduce or eliminate certain contaminants in order to improve overall indoor air quality.

Overall, an air purifier app makes it easy to stay on top of indoor air quality while giving users real-time feedback about their home environment. With this kind of technology, you can have peace-of-mind knowing that your family is breathing clean and safe indoor air at all times!

Examples of these air purifier apps are: AirVisual, Blueair Friend and Dyson Link. Some heatpumps, air con systems and house fans also have air purifier functionality and apps included. For example, the Dyson heat and cool air purifier has an app specifically for controlling the air purifying features of their heat pumps.
