If you’re a pet owner, you know how much of a hassle it can be to keep your home clean. Pet hair is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to messes and clutter, but luckily, there are some great robot vacuums on the market that can help you tackle the job. Robot vacuums are becoming increasingly popular for pet owners, as they offer convenience and efficiency when it comes to cleaning up pet hair.

When shopping for a robot vacuum specifically designed with pets in mind, there are a few key features to look for. First and foremost, you should consider suction power: the stronger the suction power of your vacuum cleaner, the better it will be able to pick up pet hair and other debris without leaving behind any residue or missed areas. You should also look for brushes designed specifically for picking up pet hair; these brushes usually feature stiff bristles or rubber material that can grab onto fur without getting tangled or clogged up easily. Lastly, if allergies are an issue in your home (especially with pets), make sure that your chosen robot vacuum has a good filtering system so that allergens won’t get kicked back into the air while cleaning. 

So what are some of the most popular robotic vacuums for pet owners? The iRobot Roomba 960 Vacuum Cleaner is one of the top contenders on this list; its 3-stage cleaning system offers increased suction power (up to 10x more than previous models), tangle-free brushes perfect for picking up fur and debris from carpets and hard floors alike, and even Carpet Boost technology which increases its performance on carpeted surfaces. Additionally, this model includes a HEPA filter which traps 99% of dust mites, pollen particles out of your home’s air while vacuuming—perfect if anyone in your household suffers from allergies! 

The Neato Botvac D7 Connected is another great option if you’re looking for an effective robot vacuum specifically designed with pets in mind; its patented spiral combo brush is specially designed to pick up both large particles like food crumbs as well as small particles like dust mites or dander—perfect if anyone in your family experiences allergies due to animals! The Botvac D7 also features high-efficiency filters with Ultra Performance Pro filter technology which captures nearly all allergens from passing through its filter upon release back into your home's air post-vacuuming session. Additionally this model includes advanced laser mapping technology which allows it to create detailed maps detailing each room’s layout so that it knows exactly where to clean next—no more missed spots! 

Whether you have dogs or cats (or both!), finding an effective yet affordable robotic vacuum cleaner specifically tailored towards picking up pesky pet hair doesn't have be difficult anymore—these two models offer convenience combined with powerful performance at an affordable price point making them perfect additions into any household where furry friends roam around freely!
