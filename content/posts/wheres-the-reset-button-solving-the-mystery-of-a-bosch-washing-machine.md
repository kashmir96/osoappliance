## Locating the Reset Button on a Bosch Washing Machine

Resetting a Bosch washing machine can be intimidating if you don't know where to look. For those who are unfamiliar with the appliance, locating the reset button could prove to be a challenge. That's why we have put together this guide to help you solve the mystery of the reset button. 

If you are searching for the reset button in your Bosch washing machine, the first step is to unplug the machine and wait for a few minutes. Typical reset buttons are placed close to the power cord and will require a flat head screwdriver to push. The location of the reset buttons may vary and could be located near the top of the machine on the side, or under the machine near the back. 

If you are unable to locate the reset button, consult the user manual for further details. To make matters simpler, modern washing machines have a diagnostic circuit that helps pinpoint the location of the reset button, if the circuit is activated. This action will usually involve activating the Start/Pause button three times. 

Once you have located and succeeded in pushing the reset button, wait for a few seconds before plugging the machine back into the wall outlet. Your Bosch washing machine should now be reset, and you can now use it as normal.
