A refrigerator is an essential household appliance that serves to keep food cold and fresh. But did you know that a fridge can also make ice? In fact, most modern refrigerators come with an icemaker built-in, making it easy to produce a steady stream of ice cubes at the touch of a button.

Using this feature is incredibly simple – you just need to press the on/off switch and fill up the reservoir with water. Then, depending on your model, set the size of ice cubes you would like to produce. Your fridge will then begin producing them automatically!

The process relies on two key components: an icemaker mechanism and a refrigerant system. First, the icemaker contains a cube tray which holds water until it freezes solid into cubes. The tray is connected to a heating element which cycles water between liquid and frozen states in order to create new cubes when needed. Next, coolant flows through the fridge’s internal coils in order to keep all surfaces inside at optimal temperatures for food storage; this same coolant helps freeze the water in the cube tray as well until they become solid cubes of ice ready for use! 
 
So that's how your fridge makes those delicious – and convenient – ice cubes for you! Now all that's left is enjoying them however you'd like!
