## Understanding and Resolving the f28 Error Code on Your Whirlpool Washer 
Is your Whirlpool washer displaying an “f28” error code? This is a common code that can be resolved without the help of a professional. Animportant thing to remember is that the “f28” error code signifies that your washer has reached a certain level of water temperature but is not able to reach an even higher one. Read on to learn more about this code and how to fix it.

This error indicates difficulty in the mechanical attempt to increase the water temperature. To resolve this, the first thing to do is unplug the washer and wait at least five minutes before plugging it back in. This allows the system to reset and may resolve the issue. If the error persists, there may be a short or blockage in the electrical connections that need attention. 

If resetting the machine did not work, the next step is to check the thermal fuse. This is a small white device that helps protect the washer by acting as a failsafe when the temperature reaches a certain level. Inspect the fuse and see if it has been damaged or blown. If it has seen any physical damage, it will need to be replaced. If it was not damaged, it will need to be tested for accuracy. 

The last step is to inspect the thermal protector device, which is connected to the heating element of the washer. This device will also need to be tested for over-heating and replaced if needed, as it is possible that this was the culprit.

The “f28″ error code can be resolved in most cases without calling in a professional, but there are times when a trained technician is required.
