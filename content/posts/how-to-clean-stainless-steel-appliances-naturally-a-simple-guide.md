## Cleaning Stainless Steel Appliances Naturally

Stainless steel appliances add a sleek, sophisticated touch to any home. However, these shiny appliances are prone to fingerprints and smudges. Thankfully, stainless steel can be cleaned with items from your pantry and a few simple steps. Follow this simple guide to learn how to clean stainless steel appliances naturally, quickly, and effectively. 

One of the easiest and most versatile ways to clean stainless steel is with a combination of white vinegar and olive oil. Vinegar naturally disinfects surfaces and breaks down dirt, soap scum, and other grime on contact. Mix ½ cup of white vinegar and ¼ cup of water in a spray bottle. For added shine and protection, add a few drops of olive oil to the mixture. Shake the bottle to mix the ingredients together. Spray the solution onto the surface of your stainless steel appliance and wipe away using a clean cloth.

Another great way to clean stainless steel appliances is with a paste of baking soda and water. Create a paste by mixing together 3 parts baking soda and 1 part water in a small bowl. Rub the paste onto the surface of the stainless steel appliance using a clean cloth. After a few minutes, remove the paste with a damp cloth and buff away with a dry and soft cloth.

To remove decal from stainless steel and to clean the crevices of your stainless steel appliance, use a toothbrush to scrub away dirt, grime, and buildup. For tough stains, consider using a paste of cream of tartar and lemon juice instead of baking soda and water.

To keep stainless steel appliances clean, use a microfiber cloth to dust and wipe away surface dirt regularly. Avoid using harsh chemicals or harsh scrubbing materials that can scratch stainless steel.

Learning how to clean stainless steel appliances naturally makes it easy to keep your home looking stylish without harsh chemicals. For additional tips and information, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
