## Troubleshooting Bosch Dishwasher Error E61-03

One of the unfortunate realities of household appliances is that they can malfunction from time-to-time, and require troubleshooting to resolve the issue. Bosch dishwashers are no exception, and when E61-03 appears on the display, it indicates that there is a water heating fault. Luckily, this problem can usually be solved using a few simple troubleshooting steps.

First, it is important to begin by unplugging the dishwasher to ensure that it is not in use while the repairs are conducted. Next, it is necessary to run a thermal cycle while checking to ensure that the dishwasher is filling up with water. If the water is not filling in, it may be a sign of a blockage in the water intake hose, and it should be inspected at this time. Additionally, the heating element should be inspected to ensure that it is working properly, as a malfunctioning element can cause the error code to be displayed.

If all of the parts of the dishwasher appear to be functioning correctly, it is important to reset the dishwasher. This can be done by pressing and holding two buttons simultaneously on the dishwasher control panel for 10 seconds, or until the machine resets itself. The exact buttons will depend on the model of Bosch dishwasher that you have, and should be listed in the user guide for your appliance.

Troubleshooting Bosch dishwasher error E61-03 is often a straightforward process that can be resolved in just a few simple steps. However, if the problem is not immediately resolved, it is best to consult a qualified service technician to further inspect the dishwasher and ensure that it is working correctly.
