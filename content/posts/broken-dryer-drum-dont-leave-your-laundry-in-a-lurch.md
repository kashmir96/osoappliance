## Don't Let a Damaged Dryer Drum Leave your Laundry in a Bind
We all know the feeling of dread when a household appliance isn’t functioning as it should. and the thought of dealing with a broken down dryer and a pile of washing is enough to make any homeowner panic. Dryers play a vital role in our day to day lives, so it’s important to know the signs and symptoms of damanged dryer drums.

A damaged dryer drum can happen for many reasons, such as weakened or worn-out drum bearings, or an incompatible motor. It’s best to get these types of issues taken care of as soon as possible, as the longer you leave them, the higher the risk of bigger and far more expensive problems further down the line.

It’s important to know the signs and symptoms of a broken dryer drum from the outset. As well as strange noises, uneven drum rotation and clothes that aren’t dried properly, you may also experience other warning signs such as excessive heat coming from the dryer drum and a marked increase in your energy bills. 

If you’ve noticed any of the signs or symptoms mentioned above, it’s best to get your dryer checked and repaired by an experienced technician as soon as possible.
