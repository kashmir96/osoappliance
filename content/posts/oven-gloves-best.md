As a kitchen essential, oven gloves are an invaluable tool for protecting your hands from hot surfaces. But if not used correctly, they can be a hazard. Here are some best practices for using oven gloves in the kitchen:

1. Make sure your oven gloves are heat-resistant. Oven gloves should be made of materials like silicone or fabric that can withstand high temperatures. This will ensure that your hands stay safe when handling hot items in the kitchen.

2. Wear the oven gloves correctly. Before using your oven gloves, make sure they’re on correctly and securely. The cuff of the glove should fit snugly around your wrist to prevent any steam or heat from escaping and burning your skin. 

3. Don’t use wet or damp oven gloves. Wet or damp oven gloves are more likely to conduct heat and cause burns than dry ones, so make sure to keep them dry at all times when handling hot items in the kitchen. 

4. Don’t leave hot items unattended with oven gloves on. Oven gloves can protect your hands from hot surfaces, but they won’t protect you from leaving hot items unattended in the kitchen or on the stovetop for too long! 

5. Store your oven gloves properly when not in use. When you’re done using them, hang them up in a dry place to ensure that they stay in good condition for future use! 

Following these simple best practices for using oven gloves will help keep you safe while cooking in the kitchen and ensure that you get the most out of your essential kitchen tool!

Examples of good quality oven gloves include the Salter Silicone Oven Gloves, which are heat-resistant up to 500°F and have a secure fit around your wrists, and the Utopia Kitchen Heat Resistant Oven Mitts, which are made of a durable cotton and polyester blend and feature a quilted design for extra heat protection.
