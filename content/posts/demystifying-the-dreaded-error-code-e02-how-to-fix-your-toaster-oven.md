## Taking the Fear out of Error Code E02 on your Toaster Oven
No one likes to see error codes when they go to use their appliances. Whether it’s an issue with your refrigerator, washer/dryer, or even your toaster oven, when you see an error code, it’s only natural to feel anxious and a little bit intimidated. This can be especially true when the error code is E02.

In this post, we’ll take a look at the common causes and solutions to Error Code E02 on your toaster oven so you can get your appliance back up and running in no time.

Error Code E02 may be caused by a few different components malfunctioning in your toaster oven such as the heater, temperature sensor, or thermal fuse. To determine which component is malfunctioning, you can do a few troubleshooting steps such as resetting the appliance, checking the heating element, and cleaning the temperature sensors. 

If resetting the appliance does not fix the problem, you’ll need to check out the heating element. This component can become damaged due to overheating so it’s important not to leave your toaster oven on for too long. To check if the heating element is causing the Error Code E02, simply unscrew the component from the back of the oven and inspect it thoroughly. 

Inspecting the temperature sensors is another troubleshooting step you can take to determine if they are the source of the error. To do this, you’ll need to use an ohmmeter to see if there is an electrical current running through the component. If there is no current detected, it’s time to replace the sensors. 

Finally, the thermal fuse is an additional component you can inspect. Again, use an ohmmeter to check if there is an electrical current running through the thermal fuse. If the fuse is the source of the error, the electrical current will be blocked and it’s time to replace the component. 

With these troubleshooting tips, we hope you feel ready to tackle Error Code E02 and get your toaster oven back up and running in no time. If you’re still having issues, however, feel free to check out our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians for more help.
