They are made from natural materials such as wool, rubber, or plastic, and are designed to reduce static and fluff up fabrics in the dryer. They can also help reduce wrinkles and reduce the amount of time it takes to dry a load of laundry.

Dryer balls work by bouncing around in the dryer, separating the clothes and allowing hot air to circulate more evenly. This helps to reduce drying time and energy consumption. The balls also help to reduce static, as the natural fibers create a barrier between the clothes and the heat. This helps to reduce static cling and keep clothes looking fresh.

Dryer balls are also a great way to soften clothes without using harsh chemicals. The natural fibers in the balls help to absorb moisture and soften fabrics. This can help to reduce wrinkles and make clothes feel softer.
