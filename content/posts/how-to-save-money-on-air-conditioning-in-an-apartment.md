In the summer months, your air conditioning bill can become quite expensive if you live in an apartment. Fortunately, there are a few simple tips that can help you save money on air conditioning in your apartment.

1. Make use of fans and open windows: Utilizing fans and opening windows (if allowed) can help keep the temperature inside your apartment relatively cool without having to run the air conditioner all day long. This is especially important during the night when temperatures tend to drop significantly. If you do need to use your AC unit, consider using it only during the hottest parts of each day and turning it off at night or when it’s cooler outside.

2. Close curtains and blinds: Keep curtains closed throughout the day as this will help keep direct sunlight from entering your home, allowing for less heat buildup inside. Additionally, closing blinds will prevent hot air from rising up into your living space. Make sure that both curtains and blinds are made of light-colored fabrics in order to maximize their effectiveness in keeping out sunlight and heat.

3. Get a smart thermostat: Smart thermostats allow you to set schedules for heating/cooling based on when you are likely to be home or away from home (e.g., during work hours). This way, you won’t have to run your AC unit all day long just because no one is home but it will still be turned on before you get back so that you have a comfortable environment waiting for you after a long day at work!

4. Programmable thermostat settings: Along with getting a smart thermostat, make sure that its settings are properly programmed according to usage needs so that energy isn’t wasted while trying to maintain an ideal comfort level inside the home (e.g., setting it higher than necessary). Doing this could save hundreds of dollars each year! 

 5 . Unplug Unused Appliances: Unplugging any unused appliances such as TVs, game consoles etc helps reduce energy consumption which leads to lower bills too! Also make sure lights don't stay on unnecessarily either by switching off lights before leaving a room or using timer switches for lamps/lighting fixtures throughout the house 

 6 . Use Insulation : Adequate insulation throughout an apartment helps reduce energy loss through walls/ceilings which would otherwise require more cooling power from AC units - leading directly towards higher bills . A professional contractor may be able to provide additional advice about this depending on specific insulation requirements for each individual property . 

Following these simple tips can help save significant amounts of money over time on air conditioning costs in apartments - allowing everyone enjoy their summer without worrying too much about sky high electricity bills !
