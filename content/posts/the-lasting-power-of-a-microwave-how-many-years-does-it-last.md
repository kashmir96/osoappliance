## Discovering the Durability of a Microwave
We all want our household appliances to last us for a long time, so we can keep using them without interruption. One of the most important and commonly used products in many households today is the microwave. But just how long can you depend on your microwave?

The average home appliance will last 10-15 years, depending on how it's made and how it's cared for. Microwaves, however, have a much shorter average lifespan of 8-10 years. While this may seem short compared to other appliances, there are certain circumstances that can contribute to a longer lifespan.

The quality of product, the frequency at which it's used, and how well it's taken care of all play a role in determining its durability. Microwaves with higher wattage, used for more complex tasks, tend to have a reduced lifespan due to the extra strain on their components. But, with proper maintenance and use, many microwaves are able to last beyond the 8-10 year average.

It's important to note that when a microwave starts to break down, it's usually due to one of two problems: a faulty electronic control board or a defective door latch. Both of these problems can be easily fixed by either replacing the faulty components or getting expert repairs. Professional repairs can be expensive, but it may be worth it in the long run if it extends the life of your microwave.

When it comes to owning a microwave, it is best to know what to expect when it comes to its lifespan. A good rule of thumb is to plan on 8-10 years from the date of purchase, and then extend it as needed depending on usage and upkeep.
