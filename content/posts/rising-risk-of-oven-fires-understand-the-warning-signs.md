## Understand the Rising Risk of Oven Fires 

Fires due to ovens are becoming increasingly common throughout the world and the risk is continuing to increase. It is important for households to understand the warning signs of the potential for an oven fire. Knowing these warning signs can help households and users of ovens protect against having a fire or even save lives. 

One of the most common warning signs of a potential oven fire is when it begins to smoke or emit a burning smell. This is usually due to too much fat or oil building up inside of the oven after regular use. This can also happen from food debris getting stuck in the heating elements. It is important to clean the oven periodically and keep it free of any food debris or fat buildup. If these signs are noticed, it is best to switch off the power to the oven and contact a local appliance repair technician immediately. 

The user should also take precautions to ensure that their oven is safe and checked when it begins to show signs of wear and tear such as rust, broken glass doors, loose knobs, dirty filters, etc. Replacing these worn parts can help prevent oven fires due to faulty wiring. Ovens should also be inspected periodically by an appliance repair technician to ensure they are working properly and safely. 

Finally, to help prevent oven fires, it is important to never leave it unattended while in use. Unattended ovens can become overheated, leading to a fire. Therefore, it is advised to keep an eye on the oven when it is in use and switch it off if there is any suspected issue.

Understanding the warning signs of potential oven fires and taking proper safety precautions can help households prevent these fires and keep their family safe. If an oven fire does begin, it is important to never attempt to put the fire out yourself and to call the fire department immediately. It is also essential to have a reliable and qualified local appliance repair technician that can help diagnose and repair any potential issues before they become a danger. 

Be aware of the rising risk of oven fires and take the necessary precautions and inspections to help keep your family safe. If you experience any issues with your oven, don't hesitate to contact a [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for assistance.
