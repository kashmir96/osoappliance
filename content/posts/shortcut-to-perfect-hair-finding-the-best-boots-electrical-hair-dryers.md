When purchasing an electrical hair dryer, it is important to consider features such as attachments--ones that diffuser, curl, or smooth hair will allow you to have an even more versatile styling experience; wattage, which is what determines the speed and temperature of your hair dryer; weight and body shape, which allows for a more comfortable experience when using the product for a longer time; and noise level, which helps minimize the hair drying experience to a quieter one.
