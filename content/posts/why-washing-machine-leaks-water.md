If your washing machine is leaking water, it can be a cause for concern. But don’t panic! In most cases, it can be fixed relatively easily. Before you call an Appliance Repair Serviceman from our directory for help, take a few moments to check the following potential causes of your washing machine leak.

1. Faulty Door Seal: The most common cause of a washing machine leak is a faulty door seal. Over time, the door seal may become worn or cracked and start to allow water to escape when the washing machine is in use. Check the seal for any signs of damage and replace if necessary.

2. Faulty Hoses: Washing machines also have hoses that supply water to them during use; these hoses can often become damaged or worn over time and start leaking as a result. Make sure that all of your hoses are firmly connected and not cracked or split anywhere before using the machine again.

3. Clogged Pump Filter: If there’s too much lint or detergent residue in your pump filter, it can create blockages which stop the drain hose from working properly and cause water to leak out onto your floor instead of being drained away down the plughole as intended! Make sure you clean out your pump filter every now and then to ensure this isn’t causing any issues with leakage in your machine! 

4 Leaking Drain Hose: Your drain hose may have become loosened from its connection at some point - this could lead to leaks if not secured correctly again! Make sure that all connections on both ends of the drain hose are securely fastened so no leakage occurs when running washes through your appliance once more! 

If none of these problems appear to be causing any leakage from your washing machine, then it could be worth calling an Appliance Repair Serviceman from our directory who will be able to investigate further into what else might be wrong with it – they should also be able to advise you on how best to fix whatever issue they identify!
