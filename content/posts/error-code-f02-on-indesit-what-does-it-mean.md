## An Explanation of Indesit Error Code F02
Error codes are often frustrating to individuals when they don’t understand what’s wrong with their household appliances. Indesit brand washing machines, for example, can stop working with a code F02 flashing across the screen. But what does this mean for the average user?

This code, specifically, is related to a draining issue. The machine will usually attempt to drain any water from the system automatically, however, due to a fault, or obstruction, the system may fail to do so. In this instance, the error code F02 will appear on the screen to alert the user that a fault exists and that service or repair may be necessary. This fault can usually be fixed quickly with some simple adjustments. 

Common reasons as to why this code may appear on the screen include when the filter, located inside the washing machine, is blocked. It may also be due to a faulty pump or drain hose. It can even be related to the timing of when the draining takes place. A few simple steps could potentially repair the issue.

The first step is to check if the filter is blocked. To locate the filter, you need to open the door of the machine and locate the filter area. There should be a small filter, which when removed, should have no signs of blockage. If any noticeable blockage is visible, then this needs to be cleared and the filter checked for any further debris.

The drain hose can sometimes become blocked, causing error code F02 to appear. Locate the small hose, usually found at the back of the machine, and check for any kinks or blockages. If necessary, pull the hose off and check for any further debris. If the blockage is severe, it’s advised to call a serviceman or repair technician to provide advice and make the necessary alterations.

It may also be related to the timing of draining, meaning the hose or filter may not have the necessary time needed to do so. In this instance, adjusting the cycle may help, making sure that the attempt to drain is given a longer duration.

By taking the time to go through each of these steps and understanding what error code F02 indicates, users of Indesit washing machines will soon be able to identify and rectify the issue quickly. It could even save the user from incurring the cost of a professional serviceman. 

Error codes are often intimidating and difficult to decipher, but with a little understanding and effort, the problem could be resolved quickly and the user can return to using their machine as normal. 

If error code F02 is still present or further fault codes become an issue, it’s always advisable to refer to an error codes glossary. At [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/), you can find the necessary information to help identify and rectify any potential faults.
