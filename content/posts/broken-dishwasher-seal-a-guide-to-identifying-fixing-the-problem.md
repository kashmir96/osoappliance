## Identifying and Repairing a Broken Dishwasher Seal 
A broken dishwasher seal can be an annoying problem that can pose a challenge to the average homeowner. While it is possible to repair a broken dishwasher seal yourself, it is often best to call an experienced appliance repair technician to fix it for you. 

In order to identify a broken dishwasher seal, you should look for signs of water leaking around the edges of the dishwasher door or other indications of water damage. You may also see condensation around the door or rusting on the seals. If your dishwasher door is difficult to open or close, or if the seal seems to be loose or broken, then the seal needs to be replaced.

If you are able to determine that the dishwasher seal is the cause of the problem, then it is important to choose the correct seal to replace it with. The seal should be the same size, shape and material as the one that is already in place, to ensure a tight fit. 

Once the new seal is in place, it is important to properly install it. This involves making sure that the gasket is aligned properly and that the screws are tightened properly. Additionally, it is important to take the time to clean the seal and gasket area before reinstalling, to prevent further damage.

Finally, it is important to check your dishwasher regularly to help prevent further damage to the seal. Regularly inspect the seals around the door and clean off any debris that may accumulate around the edges. Additionally, it is a good idea to periodically lubricate the door seals to help keep them in good condition. 

Fixing a broken dishwasher seal can be a challenging task and it is important to take the necessary steps to ensure that the job is done correctly.
