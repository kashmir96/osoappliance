## Understanding and Troubleshooting Panasonic Washing Machine Error Code H01

Most of us rely on our washing machines to clean our clothes and keep them looking in tip-top condition. At times, though, due to a variety of issues or simply normal wear and tear, errors can occur with our appliances. Understanding the errors and how to fix them can make all the difference. Panasonic washing machine error code H01 means that the appliance is not able to drain the water away, a common issue with most washing machines. This blog will discuss what this code means and how to troubleshoot the error. 

The H01 error code is an indication that the pump or the drain filter may be blocked on the Panasonic washing machine. To check if this is the case, follow the steps below:

- Use a flashlight to look for the filter at the lower left side of the washing machine 
- Open the filter cap and check if there is any lint or dirt blocking the filter 
- If the filter is blocked, make sure you clean it with a soft cloth or brush 
- After cleaning, turn the power off and then back on again
- Test the machine by running a drain and spin cycle

If the machine is still producing the H01 error code, then it is likely that the pump is blocked or faulty. To test this, do the following:

- Turn the power off and unplug the washing machine
- Take off the rear bottom panel and inspect the impeller (the rotating part of the pump) 
- Check if any foreign objects such as a sock or a piece of clothing are caught in the impeller
- Once you have identified and removed the obstruction, reassemble the machine 
- Now turn the power back on and run the machine on a drain and spin cycle to test

If you are still getting the H01 error code, then you may need to contact an authorized technician for further assistance.
