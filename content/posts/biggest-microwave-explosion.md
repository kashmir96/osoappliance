In recent years, there has been an increasing number of reports about microwave explosions, ranging from minor sparks to full-blown explosions. The biggest and most dangerous of these is known as a "microwave fireball," which occurs when the microwaves inside the appliance cause an extreme build-up of heat that cannot escape through the vents. This can lead to a massive release of energy and pressure, resulting in a powerful explosion.

Microwave fireballs are especially dangerous because they can occur without warning and have the potential to cause severe injuries or death. In one particularly shocking incident in 2017, a man in England died after his microwave exploded while he was using it. The explosion caused severe burns all over his body and sent shrapnel flying into other rooms in his house. 

While it's impossible to predict when or if a microwave might explode, there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk: 
- Check for any signs of damage before using your microwave (e.g., cracks or discoloration). 
- Make sure that you follow safety instructions carefully when using your microwave (such as not overloading it with food). 
- If possible, avoid heating up items that could potentially explode in a microwave (such as eggs). 
- Consider taking regular breaks while using your appliance so that its interior doesn't get too hot. 

Overall, while it's impossible to eliminate all risks associated with microwaves, following these tips will help ensure that you stay safe when using them!
