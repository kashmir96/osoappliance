Oven racks are an essential component of any oven, providing support for baking dishes and pans. They are typically made of metal or wire and come in a variety of sizes and shapes to fit different oven models. Oven racks allow heat to circulate evenly throughout the oven, ensuring that food cooks properly and consistently. They also provide a safe place to store items while they're baking, eliminating the need to reach into a hot oven.

Oven racks are designed with slots that hold baking dishes and pans in place, so they don't move around while you're cooking. This is especially important when using delicate items such as cakes or pastries, as they can easily be damaged if not properly supported. Oven racks also keep dishes from touching the sides of the oven, which can lead to uneven heating and poor cooking results.

In addition to providing support for baking dishes, oven racks can also be used for cooling baked goods after they come out of the oven. Placing items on an oven rack allows air to circulate around them, which helps them cool quickly and evenly. This is especially important for delicate items such as cakes or pastries that need to cool slowly in order to maintain their shape and texture.

Oven racks are also useful for broiling food close to the heating element in order to achieve a crispier texture on the outside while keeping the inside moist and tender. In this case, it's important to use an oven rack that is placed far enough away from the heating element so that it doesn't burn your food.

Finally, oven racks are great for keeping your kitchen organized by providing additional storage space for pots, pans, and other cooking utensils. This eliminates clutter in your kitchen cabinets and drawers while still keeping everything within easy reach when you need it.

Overall, oven racks are an essential part of any kitchen setup as they provide support for baking dishes while ensuring even heat distribution throughout the oven. They also provide a safe place for cooling baked goods after they come out of the oven and can be used for broiling food close to the heating element. Finally, they help keep your kitchen organized by providing additional storage space for pots, pans, and other utensils.
