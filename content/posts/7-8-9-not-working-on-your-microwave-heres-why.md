## Why Are Your 7 8 9 Keypad Not Working On Your Microwave?

Microwaves are one of the most beloved and most used household appliances. They are great for preparing quick meals, heating food for the entire family, and even defrosting food. 

However, with so much frequent use, microwaves can sometimes experience technical issues. One of the most common issues may be that the 7, 8, and 9 buttons on the number pad are not working. This could be due to an electrical fault with the number pad itself, or it could be due to something else entirely. 

If your 7, 8, and 9 buttons are not working on your microwave, the problem may be due to a faulty number pad. If this is the case, the number pad will need to be replaced. It's easiest to do this with a professional, but if you're feeling brave, you may be able to do it yourself. However, if the problem persists after replacing the number pad, you should consider taking your microwave to a professional technician.

The other possible cause of your 7, 8 and 9 buttons not working could be a circuit board issue. If this is the case, the circuit board will need to be repaired or replaced. As this involves a more technical repair, it's best to leave this to a professional technician.
