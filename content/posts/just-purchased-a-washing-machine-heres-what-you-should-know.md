## Congratulations on Your New Washing Machine!

Now that you have your new washing machine, it's time to prepare. Appliances are a big investment and should be treated with respect and proper maintenance to keep them running in optimal condition. Here are some tips to help you start off right with your new washing machine and prepare you for a long and happy life together.

First, take a look at the user's manual. This is an essential part of using any new appliance correctly and safely. Your manual will include information about proper installation and use of your washing machine, and it should be followed to the letter. You may also find helpful information about features, cycles, and how to clean and maintain your machine.

Second, make sure to pay attention to the details of where your washing machine is installed. Make sure that you have correctly installed all of the necessary hoses and cords and keep them free of any obstructing objects. Also, be sure that your washing machine is level with the ground, since this will help keep it running efficiently.

Third, some basic maintenance of your washing machine can go a long way in making sure it lasts for many years to come. Inspect the water and drain hoses for any signs of wear or damage and replace them if needed. Clean the rubber gaskets and filters on a regular basis and always empty the lint tray after a washing cycle. Additionally, make sure to keep records of all repairs and maintenance on your machine over time.

Finally, to get the best results from your washing machine, use the right amount of detergent, fabric softener, and bleach for each load. Using too much or too little of these products can cause damage to your machine or clothes, so make sure you read the instructions carefully.

We hope these tips have given you the information and peace of mind you need to make the most of your new washing machine. If you're ready to explore more with your appliances, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
