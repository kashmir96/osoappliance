## Ensure Safe Operation of Your Fume Hood
Fume hoods are important tools in laboratories, as they are designed to protect lab workers from hazardous fumes, gases, and vapors. Proper use of a fume hood is essential to ensure the safety of everyone working in the lab.

The first step to operate your fume hood safely is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure to check the user manual for your specific fume hood to understand how it works and how to use it correctly.

It is important to regularly inspect your fume hood to make sure the protection it provides is not compromised. After each use, check the seals, grills, panels, and fans for any signs of wear or damage. Also be sure to check for any leaks that may allow hazardous substances to escape.

The amount of air flow through the hood should be maintained at a specific level. The best way to ensure this is to keep the fume hood clean and free from debris. Any build-up of material can block or restrict the airflow, diminishing the protection offered. Be sure to properly clean your fume hood after each use, and perform regular maintenance checks to make sure any blockages are resolved.

When using the fume hood, make sure that any hazardous substances are placed as far back as possible within the hood, ensuring maximum protection. All containers should be firmly closed, and secure containers should always be used when storing hazardous substances. Warning signs should be visibly posted when necessary to alert other lab workers to potential risks.

By regularly inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining your fume hood and following safety protocols, you can ensure the safety of everyone working in the lab. Refresh your understanding of proper procedures and refer to the user manual of your specific fume hood if you need. If you encounter any problems with the fume hood, or find any signs of damage, you should contact a qualified appliance repair technician found in our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to help ensure your laboratory is always safe.

## What is a Fume Hood?

A fume hood is a ventilation of device that is designed to limit exposure to hazardous or toxic fumes, vapors, and dusts. Fume hoods are commonly used in laboratories, medical facilities, and industrial settings to provide personnel protection. 

## What Are the Benefits of Using a Fume Hood?

Fume hoods provide personnel protection by containing toxic substances and reducing the amount of hazardous substances being released into the air. By reducing exposure to hazardous substances, fume hoods help improve laboratory safety, reduce the risk of contaminating equipment, and can reduce the cost of labor, materials, and training. 

## What are the Best Practices for Fume Hood Use?

1. Regularly inspect your fume hood for damages or signs of wear to ensure proper operation.
2. Perform regular maintenance checks, such as replacing filters and cleaning any dust collectors.
3. Adjust the fume hood to the proper height and position for working correctly.
4. Keep combustible materials and heat sources away from the fume hood.
5. Ensure the fume hood is properly vented and that the sash completely closes when not in use.

## What Should I Do if There Is an Emergency?

If an emergency arises while working with a fume hood, be sure to evacuate the room and immediately turn off the power to the fume hood. Once the emergency is cleared, inspect the fume hood for any damage and make the necessary repairs. 

## What Type of Training Should I Receive When Using a Fume Hood?

In order to safely use a fume hood, personnel must be familiar with the fume hood itself and the type of gases or chemicals being used. It is recommended to consistently review safety policies and procedures and receive periodic refresher training in order to remain up to date on the best practices for fume hood use.
