## Troubleshooting Tips for E1 Error in Freezers

If you’re having trouble with your standalone freezer and the error code “E1” appears on its display panel, this can be concerning and frustrating. However, it’s important to understand that these codes don’t necessarily require a repairman – they’re generally just letting you know that there’s a temporary problem within the appliance that needs to be addressed. 

The first step in fixing the issue is to identify the problem’s source. Generally the ‘E1’ code indicates a loss of power or an overheating of the freezer’s internal system. If the freezer seems to be unexpectedly shut off, check its power cord, power outlet and circuit breaker. In most cases this is typically the issue and the problem can be solved with a simple re-plug and reset. 

If the problem is not related to power, then the wall socket should still be checked for voltage and proper grounding. To check the freezer’s internal system for overheating, use a thermometer to test its internal temperature and ensure that it is at 0°F. If the temperature readings are higher, then other components within the freezer should be tested such as the compressor and collection unit. 

It’s important to note that certain heavier models of stand-alone freezers will have a different error codes to indicate trouble. Certain models are equipped with temperature sensors that display a blinking ‘E’ when the interior temperature is too high. In this case the freezer should be switched off and left on pause until the temperature cools down sufficiently.
