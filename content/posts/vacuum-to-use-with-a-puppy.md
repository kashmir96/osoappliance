If you’re a new puppy parent, you may be wondering how to clean up the inevitable messes that come with having a furry friend in your home. Vacuuming is a great way to keep your home clean, but it can be a bit intimidating when it comes to vacuuming with a puppy in the house.

The first step to successful vacuuming with a puppy is to make sure your puppy is comfortable with the vacuum. Start by introducing your puppy to the vacuum when it is turned off. Allow your puppy to sniff and explore the vacuum. Once your puppy is comfortable with the vacuum, you can start to turn it on and off while your puppy is in the room. It’s important to stay in the room with your puppy while the vacuum is on so that your puppy doesn’t become scared.

Once your puppy is comfortable with the vacuum, you can start to vacuum around them. Make sure to move slowly and give your puppy plenty of time to adjust to the noise and movement of the vacuum. If your puppy gets scared, take a break and try again later.

When vacuuming with a puppy, it’s important to pay attention to where you are vacuuming. Puppies can be easily startled by the noise of the vacuum and may try to run away. Make sure to keep the vacuum away from your puppy’s face and body. Also, be aware of cords and other items that your puppy may try to chew on.

Finally, make sure to reward your puppy for being brave and staying calm while you vacuum. This will help your puppy associate the vacuum with positive experiences and make it easier for them to stay calm while you vacuum in the future.

Vacuuming with a puppy doesn’t have to be a stressful experience. With patience and practice, you and your puppy can learn to coexist peacefully while you keep your home clean.
