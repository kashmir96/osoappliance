When it comes to dishwashers, many people overlook the importance of using salt. Salt helps to reduce the hardness of water, which can cause a build-up of limescale on your dishes and in your dishwasher. It also helps to soften the water, which can help to prevent soap scum from forming on your dishes.

Using salt in your dishwasher is a simple process. All you need to do is add a few tablespoons of salt to the dishwasher's detergent compartment. This will help to ensure that the salt is evenly distributed throughout the dishwasher cycle.

It's important to note that not all dishwashers require salt. Some dishwashers have a built-in water softener, which eliminates the need for salt. However, if your dishwasher does not have a built-in water softener, then it's important to add salt to the detergent compartment.

It's also important to use the correct type of salt for your dishwasher. Table salt or rock salt is not recommended, as it can clog the dishwasher's filter. Instead, you should use a dishwasher salt that is specifically designed for dishwashers. This type of salt is usually available at most grocery stores.

Finally, it's important to check the salt levels in your dishwasher regularly. If the salt levels become too low, then it can cause limescale and soap scum to build up on your dishes. To check the salt levels, simply remove the detergent compartment and look for a salt indicator. If the indicator is red, then it's time to add more salt.

In conclusion, dishwashers always need salt. Salt helps to reduce the hardness of water, which can cause a build-up of limescale on your dishes and in your dishwasher. It also helps to soften the water, which can help to prevent soap scum from forming on your dishes. Be sure to use the correct type of salt and to check the salt levels regularly.
