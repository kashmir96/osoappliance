When it comes to servicing a dryer, one of the most common components that needs to be checked is the belt. The belt is an important part of the dryer that helps it run efficiently and effectively. But where exactly is this belt located? 

The belt on a dryer can be found at the back of the machine, underneath the drum. To access it, you’ll need to remove the back panel of your dryer. Depending on your model, this could involve removing several screws or other fasteners in order to get access. 

Once you have removed the back panel, you should be able to see the belt running from one side of your dryer’s motor to its drum. This belt should be free from any signs of wear or damage and should turn freely when you spin it with your hand. If there are any signs of wear or damage, then it’s likely time for a replacement belt. 

It’s also important to check for any buildup around the area where the belt runs as this can cause friction and reduce efficiency. If you find any debris or buildup, then make sure to clean it away before replacing or adjusting your dryer’s belt as necessary. 

By locating and inspecting your dryer’s belt regularly, you can help ensure that your machine runs like new for years to come!
