## Troubleshooting a Faulty Washing Machine Motor
The washing machine is a workhorse of any modern household, but when the motor breaks down, attempting to fix it can be overwhelming. How do you even begin to troubleshoot a broken motor? 

To get started, the first step is to understand the individual components of the washing machine and how they are connected. In most cases, the motor is connected to the wiring harness which powers the various components of the washing machine, including the spinning drum and agitator. Depending on the model, the motor could be mounted in the bottom of the machine or attached to the side. 

The next step is to check for any obvious signs of damage such as exposed wiring or a broken belt. If any of these signs are present, the motor should be replaced rather than repaired. Alternatively, if the motor appears undamaged, it is time to test the power supply. To do this, use a multimeter to determine if there is an electrical current flowing from the wiring harness to the motor. If there is, it indicates that the motor is receiving power and you should move on to the next step.

If all else fails, it may be necessary to disassemble the motor and attempt to diagnose the issue further. This requires expertise and caution, and so it is recommended to seek help from a qualified appliance repair technician.
