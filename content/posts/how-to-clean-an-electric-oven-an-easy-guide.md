###### Follow these Steps for Sparkling Clean Results
Cleaning your oven can be a labor-intensive chore, but thankfully with the right steps it can be made easier. Whether your oven is needing a light refresh or a deep cleaning, this guide will take you through the process of getting it back to sparkling clean.

The first step is to remove any shelves and grids, as well as the oven lightbulb cover. You can then scrub these with a scouring powder and hot water. For stubborn areas, use a heavy-duty scouring pad. Cheap baking soda can also be used to help penetrate the grease and The heat helps to create a vaporizing effect with the scouring powder or baking soda, making it very effective. Baking soda is great because it is easy to remove and it wonâ€™t scratch interior surfaces unlike scouring pads.

One cleaning solution often used for electric ovens is a special oven cleaner. This has a volatile compound that breaks down the grease and dirt, so you don't need to rely on vigorous scrubbing. Spray the clean solution in the oven and let it sit for the recommended amount of time before wiping it off with a damp cloth.

For a really deep clean, you can use a steam cleaner, which is designed for interior and exterior oven cleaning. Fill the steam cleaner with a mixture of white vinegar and water, as this scent is less obtrusive then using other cleaners. Then fill the steam cleaner with water, turn it on and leave it for about half an hour before turning it off and running a cloth over the inside of the oven. 

Taking the few minutes to regularly clean your oven's interior can help keep your cooking temperatures consistent, and also keep the oven looking like new. If you find that your electric oven is not heating or cooking evenly, it is likely time to check the heating elements. A qualified appliance repair technician should be consulted - our directory of appliance repair technicians can help you locate one in your area.
