In the past, laundromats were a bare-bones, utilitarian experience. But today, modern laundromats offer much more than just washing and drying machines. With an increasing focus on customer experience, many have added amenities that make laundry day easier, faster, and more enjoyable. 

The most basic of these additions are things like free Wi-Fi, TVs with streaming services like Netflix or Hulu to watch while waiting for laundry to finish. Many also offer comfortable seating so customers can relax while they wait (or even take a snooze). A growing number are adding vending machines with snacks and drinks to help customers pass the time in comfort too. 

More sophisticated laundromats now offer additional services such as folding stations equipped with advanced automated folding machines that sort clothes by type and fold them quickly and neatly into neat piles ready for pickup or drop off at home later. Some even have garment steamers available so customers can touch up clothing before packing it away. In addition to these convenience features there are often instructional videos displayed on screens throughout the store which demonstrate proper laundering techniques or tips on how to keep clothes looking their best for longer periods of time. 

Some modern laundromats have taken things one step further by introducing systems that allow customers to pay for their wash cycles using their smartphones or payment cards eliminating the need for coins altogether! Others have installed app-controlled self-service washers which allow users to start wash cycles from anywhere at any time making it possible for people who don’t have access to conventional washing machines at home due to space constraints easily do laundry when they want without having to leave their house if they don’t want too! 

Overall modern innovations in laundry amenities are making it easier than ever before for people of all kinds--from busy professionals who need quick results during lunch breaks; young adults living in small apartments; college students living off campus; and elderly individuals who still live independently but may not be able manage larger appliances--to take care of their own personal hygiene needs without having sacrifice comfort convenience or efficiency.
