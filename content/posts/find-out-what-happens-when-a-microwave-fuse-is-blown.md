## What Happens When a Microwave Fuse Blows?

If your microwave is on the fritz, you may be wondering why and may have heard the words "fuse blown" thrown around. Whether this is your diagnosis or not, it's important to know what happens when a microwave fuse blows and how to tackle the issue.

A microwave fuse is a device that serves as a safety measure, helping to prevent damage to the appliance and to protect you from potentially dangerous short circuits. The microwave's thermal fuse operates as a part of the internal electrical system to monitor the temperature inside the unit. Whenever the temperature reaches dangerous levels, the fuse cuts the power to the microwave and effectively shuts it down.

What can you do if you find out your microwave fuse is blown? You will need to purchase and install a new fuse to get the appliance back up and running. If the fuse has blown repeatedly, the underlying cause could be a problem with the appliance itself or a fault in the home's wiring. It's wise to have the appliance and wiring checked by a qualified electrician before replacing the fuse just in case.

If your microwave is giving you trouble and you suspect your fuse might be blown, don't panic â€“ you have options! Take a look at our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to help you determine if this is the issue and, if it is, how to go about replacing the fuse and get your microwave back up and running!
