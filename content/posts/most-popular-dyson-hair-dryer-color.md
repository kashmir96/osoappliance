If you’re shopping for a Dyson hair dryer, you may be surprised to learn that there isn’t just one color option. In fact, the popular hair dryer comes in a variety of colors and finishes, from classic white to metallic silver and even fuchsia pink. But which color is the most popular? 

The answer may surprise you: The most popular Dyson hair dryer color is actually black. Black is a timeless classic that looks great with any outfit or hairstyle and never goes out of style. It also blends in easily with other appliances and won't look dated in years to come. Plus, it's an easy color to match with other styling tools like flat irons or curling wands if you want to build up your styling arsenal. 

But black isn't the only popular choice when it comes to Dyson hair dryers—silver is also quite popular. This sleek metallic finish adds a touch of modern sophistication to any bathroom countertop and looks great when paired with other stainless steel appliances as well as more colorful accessories like fun brushes or blowout diffusers. 

Finally, pink is another top pick for those who want something a bit more eye-catching than basic black or silver. A bright pink hue adds instant personality and fun flair to any bathroom vanity—just make sure it matches your towels! 

Whether you go for classic black, modern silver or bold pink, there’s no wrong choice when it comes to picking out the perfect Dyson hair dryer for your needs!
