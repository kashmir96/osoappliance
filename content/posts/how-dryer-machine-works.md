We all rely on dryers to make our laundry day a little easier and faster. But how does a dryer work?

A dryer uses heated air and a spinning drum to dry clothes. Inside the machine, there is an electric motor that powers the drum as it rotates. The motor can be powered by either gas or electricity, depending on what type of machine you have. A fan inside the machine then blows hot air through the drum, which helps speed up the drying process. As your clothes tumble in the spinning drum, they are exposed to this hot air which evaporates any moisture from them.

The temperature of the air can be adjusted with a thermostat located on the front or side of your machine. This thermostat allows you to customize how hot or cold you would like your clothes to be dried at so you can choose between warm and cool temperatures according to what kind of item is being dried (e.g., towels versus delicates). Additionally, some machines also come with additional timed settings for more precise control over how long it takes for each load of laundry to finish drying. 

Finally, when your load has finished drying in its entirety, most machines will automatically shut off – saving energy and money! If you have an older model however that doesn’t have this feature built-in, simply remember to switch off your machine manually when done using it – especially if you’re not planning on doing another load right away! So now that we know a bit about how these handy appliances work – happy laundering!
