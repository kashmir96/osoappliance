## Electric Range Hood Clearance Essential Info 
As a homeowner, it's important to understand all the necessary requirements for efficiently operating an electric range. One very crucial factor to consider is the electric range hood clearance. If a range hood is not properly mounted or the clearance is not the right size, this can lead to major problems. This blog will briefly explain the necessary electric range hood clearance and the importance of getting it right.

When an electric range is being installed, the range hood needs to be installed above it. The hood's clearance to the surface of the cooktop should be at least 18 inches. When the hood is installed too close or too far away, it can make proper ventilation much more difficult, leading to the malfunctioning of the electric range. These ranges require the right amount of air flow to operate properly, and so when their clearance is not adequate, their performance will suffer. 

In addition to having enough space between the hood and the cooktop, it's also important to factor in enough space for the combustible material in the kitchen. Wall cabinets that are too close can restrict air flow and create temperature flames. Proper ventilation is needed for an electric range to work effectively, so ensuring proper clearance around your range hood is critical. 

Overall, it's essential to understand the importance of proper electric range hood clearance for your electric range to work properly. Not only does it need to be the right distance from the cooktop, but it also has to provide enough room for combustible material around it. Without this crucial element in place, the performance of an electric range may suffer or it may not even work at all.
