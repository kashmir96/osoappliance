Stovetop cooking is a great way to quickly and easily prepare delicious meals. But to get the best results, it's important to understand how to use the different heat settings on your stove. Medium heat is one of the most commonly used settings and it can be used for a variety of cooking tasks.

Medium heat is generally considered to be between medium-low and medium-high on the stovetop. It is essentially half way between off and max heat. This setting is great for gently cooking foods that require a moderate amount of time, such as simmering sauces or sautéing vegetables. It’s also ideal for browning meats or frying eggs without burning them.

When using medium heat, you should use a medium-sized pan that’s not too hot or cold. This will ensure that the food cooks evenly and doesn’t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. It’s also important to stir your food often so that it doesn’t overcook on one side.

If you’re new to stovetop cooking, it can take some practice to get a feel for which heat setting is best for each recipe. But once you get the hang of it, you’ll find that medium heat is an incredibly versatile setting that can be used for many different dishes.
