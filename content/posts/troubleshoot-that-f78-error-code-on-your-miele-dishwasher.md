## Troubleshooting f78 Error Code on a Miele Dishwasher

If you have a Miele dishwasher and it’s recently begun displaying an error code of “F78”, you’ll need to take a few steps to troubleshoot the issue and get it running properly again. This article will provide further detail into troubleshooting this error code and instructions on how to fix it.

The first step in identifying the cause of the F78 error code is to open the dishwasher door and look for any water or residual fluid that has been left behind from a previous cycle. If pooling liquid is present, it’s likely the filter needs to be cleaned. The filter, which can be found in the bottom of the dishwasher, can easily be unscrewed and checked for buildup. If necessary, the filter should be removed and cleaned with a towel.

Once the filter is cleaned, the flow sensor located in the dishwasher should also be inspected and thoroughly cleaned. This sensor can often also be the cause of the F78 code, which is triggered when the flow sensor cannot detect water, or when it cannot detect the flow of water.

In some cases, the sensor may be faulty and need to be replaced. If the filter and flow sensor do not seem to be the culprits, the next step is to check the dishwasher’s drain pump for any blockage or damage. The pump should be checked for obstructions, and should spin if it is not damaged or otherwise malfunctioning. If the pump is not spinning, or there is some other issue, it should be serviced or replaced as soon as possible.

If the pump and filter both look normal, and the F78 error has not been resolved, then the next step is to check the dishwasher’s water intake valve. This valve should be inspected to ensure that it’s not blocked or damaged and that it’s providing adequate water pressure.

Overall, troubleshooting an F78 error code does not necessarily require a professional appliance repair technician. The steps outlined in this article, when followed correctly and thoroughly, can help to identify and fix the issue. That said, if you’ve taken all of these steps and the error persists, it’s advisable to contact a professional appliance repair technician.
