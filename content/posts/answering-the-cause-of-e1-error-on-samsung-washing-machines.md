## Solving the Cause of E1 Error on Samsung Washing Machines

If you own a Samsung washing machine, it may display a “E1 Error”. This is a common error that needs to be addressed. Fortunately, the causes of this problem can be identified and the solution can be found in no time.

The cause of the E1 error code on Samsung washing machines is a malfunctioning sensor. This could be caused by a buildup of lint, faulty wiring, or corrosion along the electrical path. It’s important to identify where the problem is located in order to be able to fix it. To do this, the first step is to unplug the washing machine and remove the back panel.

Now that you have the back panel removed, locate the sensor or the wiring connected to it. Clean off any lint or contaminants that might be present. After the area is cleaned, check the wiring which can be done by using a voltage detector or a multimeter. If any wiring is damaged, this will need to be replaced.

If the wiring connections are secure and no damage is found, the next thing to check is whether there is corrosion inside the machine. Check each individual wire connection for any signs of corrosion or rust. If so, use a wire brush to clean off the rust particles.

Once all of these steps are taken, plug the washing machine back in and see if the E1 error code is still present. If the error code is still present, it’s likely that the sensor needs to be replaced. Seek out a professional if this is the case.

In conclusion, the cause of the E1 error code on Samsung washing machines is a malfunctioning sensor. Identifying where the problem is located is the first step. After this, it’s a matter of troubleshooting and making the necessary repairs.
