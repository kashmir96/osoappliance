## Understanding the Error Messages of Your Shark Robot Vacuum

It's no secret that robot vacuums make our lives easier, but sometimes unexplained error codes on the display can cause frustration or confusion. Understanding what the error codes mean on your Shark vacuum can help you troubleshoot the issue without having to call for assistance. 

When a critical issue arises with your Shark robot vacuum, it will send an error alert to the display. The error code may spell out a word or have a combination of letters and numbers. Knowing what the code means can make all the difference in solving the issue.

The most common error codes associated with Shark vacuums are the "EH1" or "HE1" code. This error typically occurs when the dust bin is full, blocking airflow and preventing the vacuum from continuing to clean. To fix this issue, empty out the dust bin, replace the filter, and check to make sure the airways on the bin and the base of the vacuum are free of debris.

Other common problem codes to be aware of are the "8 VIB" and "4 VIB" codes. These codes indicate that a side brush is stuck or not connecting properly. This can be fixed by cleaning and inspecting the side brushes and making sure everything is attached properly. Additionally, be sure to check for any obstructions that may be preventing the brushes from spinning.

If you've exhausted these troubleshooting methods and are still getting error messages, there may be an issue with the vacuum's battery. This can be checked by inspecting the battery port, ensuring that it is clean and free of debris. Additionally, check that the battery is properly connecting with the port.
