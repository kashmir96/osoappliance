Are you in the market for a dryer? Does the thought of shelling out for a new one feel daunting? Stop wasting time and check out refurbished dryers in your area. Refurbished dryers offer great savings potential and the convenience of quick access to a wide variety of styles and models. 

Refurbished dryers are pre-owned machines that have been inspected, serviced and oftentimes upgraded. They are in great condition and may include functionalities that are out of date on new machines. By purchasing a refurbished dryer you can save up to 60% off the cost of a new machine. Another benefit is access to more diverse models that may not be available in store, including models from previous years.

Another upside is that a refurbished dryer may already come with replacement parts installed. This way, you don’t have to wait in line for long periods of time or spend money on costly repairs. Refurbished dryers can be acquired quickly as you won’t have to wait for shipping. You may also be eligible for additional deals or discounts when you purchase a used dryer. 

Not sure about what model to buy? Here are some good tips to shop for dryers:
- Consider the features
- Check the manufacturer rating 
- Consider energy efficiency
- Read consumer reviews
- Check for warranty options
