## Identifying and Troubleshooting Sole F65 Error Codes

The Sole F65 code is an example of a troubleshooting code that can provide insight into the issue at hand. Knowing the common troubleshooting steps associated with the Sole F65 code can save both time and resources in identifying and addressing the problem.

The majority of Sole F65 codes are caused by a problem with the motor unit. This could manifest in a lack of power or a suction issue caused by either a damaged connection or a dirty filter.

Additionally, it is important to verify the filter is clean and the unit is not low on power. If the Sole F65 code persists, it is likely that the motor must be replaced.
