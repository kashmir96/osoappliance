An oven not lighting can be a frustrating problem to have. It can be caused by a variety of different factors, from a faulty igniter to a broken thermostat. In order to determine the cause of the issue and find a solution, there are a few steps you can take. 

The first step is to check the power source. Make sure that the oven is properly plugged into an outlet and that the circuit breaker hasn't been tripped. If the oven is connected properly, then you should move on to checking the igniter. The igniter is what actually lights the gas in your oven, so if it's not working properly then your oven won't light. You can test the igniter by turning on the gas and listening for a clicking sound coming from inside the oven. If you don't hear anything, then it's likely that your igniter needs to be replaced. 

If your igniter is working properly, then you should check for any blockages in your gas line that might be preventing proper flow of gas into your oven. If there are any blockages, they should be cleared before attempting to light your oven again. 

Finally, if all else fails, it's possible that your thermostat has gone bad and needs to be replaced. The thermostat is responsible for regulating the temperature inside your oven and if it's not working correctly then it won't light up no matter what you do. Replacing a thermostat is typically an easy process but it's best left to professionals if you're not comfortable doing it yourself. 

These are just some of the possible reasons why your oven isn't lighting up and how you can go about fixing it. Remember that always take extra caution when dealing with gas appliances as they can be dangerous if handled improperly!
