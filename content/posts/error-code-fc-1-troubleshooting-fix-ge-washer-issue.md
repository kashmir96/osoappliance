## Troubleshooting GE Washer Error Code FC 1
Did your GE Washer start flashing an FC 1 error code? You're not alone. Many GE Washers will display an FC 1 error code when the machine stops spinning or won't spin. Audio loud humming or other strange noises may also be heard coming from the washer when the code is displayed. In this guide, we'll explain why your washer is displaying this code and the best way to fix the problem.

The FC 1 error code could be caused by a number of problems. It could be due to a faulty lid switch, a jammed pump, a bad timer, a faulty wiring connection, an incorrect water level setting, or a clogged drain hose. To determine the cause of the code, you'll need to open up the washer to inspect it for any of these problems (or others). You should also make sure that the wiring is all connected properly and that the water drain hose is not clogged.

Once you've identified the cause of the FC 1 error code, you'll need to determine the best way to fix the problem. If the cause is a faulty lid switch, you'll need to replace it. If the cause is a jammed pump, you should unplug the washer and examine it for any blockages that may be preventing the impeller from spinning. If the cause of the problem is a bad timer, you'll need to have it replaced.

In some cases, the FC 1 error code can be caused by a clogged drain hose. To clean the hose, you should disconnect it from the washer and inspect it for any blockages or debris. Use a damp cloth to remove any build-up from the hose before reconnecting it.

Error code FC 1 can be a pesky problem. However, if you take the time to inspect the washer and diagnose the issue, you should be able to fix it yourself.
