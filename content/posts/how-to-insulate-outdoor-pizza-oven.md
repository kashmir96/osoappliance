If you're a pizza lover and you're looking to up your cooking game, consider adding an outdoor pizza oven to your backyard! Most outdoor pizza ovens are made of either brick or stone, which can be great for retaining heat but also require a bit of extra insulation to make sure that the heat stays in the oven and doesn't escape. Here's how to insulate an outdoor pizza oven so you can enjoy delicious homemade pizzas all year long!

First, start by covering the exterior of your oven with ceramic fiber blanket insulation. This will help keep the heat inside the oven and protect it against weathering. Make sure to cut it several inches larger than the size of your oven for adequate coverage. Secure this insulation with high-temperature adhesive tape or screws.

Next, use refractory mortar to seal any seams or cracks between bricks or stones on your pizza oven. This will further insulate and protect your oven from weather damage while still allowing air flow for proper ventilation. You can apply this mortar using either a trowel or putty knife depending on how big the gaps are. Make sure to allow plenty of time for drying before using your pizza oven!

Finally, attach kettles around the outside walls of your outdoor pizza oven as another layer of insulation. This is especially important if you live in colder climates where temperatures drop significantly during winter months! Kettles act as small radiators that absorb heat from within the brickwork and release it back into the surrounding environment when needed, creating an extra barrier against cold drafts while still allowing air flow through grates at both ends of each kettle. Just make sure they’re securely fastened so they don’t come loose with changes in temperature! 

With just these few steps, you can easily insulate an outdoor pizza oven so you can enjoy delicious homemade pizzas all year round! Whether you’re baking up classic Neapolitan-style pies or experimenting with unique new recipes – there's nothing like fresh-baked pizzas right out of a wood-fired brick stove!
