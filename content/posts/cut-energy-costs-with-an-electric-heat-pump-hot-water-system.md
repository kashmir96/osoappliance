## Cut Costs on Hot Water with an Electric Heat Pump System

Are you looking to lower your monthly energy costs, while still having hot water for all of your daily needs? An electric heat pump hot water system may be the answer you are looking for. By using a combination of air and heat to warm water, the electric heat pump system is efficient and saves energy when compared to traditional hot water systems. 

In traditional electric hot water systems, a storage tank is heated by heating elements, which are incredibly wasteful of electricity. With an electric heat pump system, the electricity is used to drive a compressor, which cools and heats refrigerants in the heat pump before these are used to heat water. This system has the dual benefit of being far more efficient – meaning you save money – while also helping to reduce your carbon footprint. 

The initial cost of installation of an electric heat pump system is greater than a traditional hot water system, but the cost benefits should be realized within a short period of time. Depending on the geographical position, type of system, and size of the area you need to heat, savings of up to 75% on power bills can be achievable with this system. 

Electric heat pump hot water systems are a great choice for those who care not only about costs and efficiency, but also the environment. If you are considering a new hot water system for your home or business, the electric heat pump system is definitely worth looking into. 

So if you're looking for ways to reduce your energy bill and do your part for the environment, be sure to check out an electric heat pump hot water system.
