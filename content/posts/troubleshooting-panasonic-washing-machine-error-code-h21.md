## Troubleshooting Panasonic Washing Machine Error Code H21

Having trouble with your Panasonic washer displaying an error code? Error code H21 in particular? Look no further! This blog post breaks down the code, what it means and how to fix it.

The Error Code H21 is displayed when an unusually high amount of water has been detected inside the washer. This can be caused by water coming in through the intake hoses faster than it is drained by the washer pump. This can happen if the washer is connected to a defective pressure switch, a loose or kinked drain hose, or the pump running too slow or too fast.

To fix this, check that the pressure switch is functioning correctly and that the drain hose and pump are in working order. Make sure the drain hose is not kinked or clogged and that the water running through it is not restricted in any way. The pump should also be checked for proper operation and that it is running at the correct speed.

If the pressure switch, drain hose and pump functions properly, but the H21 error code is still being displayed, the cause of the problem may be due to a faulty water inlet valve. If this is the case, the water inlet valve needs to be replaced.

To prevent this error code from happening again, make sure that the pressure switch, drain hose, pump and water inlet valve are all functioning properly.
