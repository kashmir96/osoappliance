## Give Your Refrigerator a Natural Clean For a Sparkling Shine
Taking the time to give your refrigerator a deep clean can be a chore, but it’s important for the longevity of your appliance. Refrigerators are essential these days, and it's important to take care of them to extend their life and make them look their best. Natural cleaning techniques are safe for your family and delicate finishes, and often achieve better results than harsh synthetic cleaners. Here's how to keep your refrigerator looking its best with natural ingredients. 

### Wash the Exterior

Clean the outside of your fridge with a mixture of mild soap and warm water. This will remove fingerprints, stuck-on food, and other grime. You can add a few drops of baking soda or tea tree oil to the water for added disinfecting power. Dry with a soft cloth afterwards to ensure no moisture is left behind.

### Dispose of Expired Foods

Food can accumulate over time, so now is a great time to open up your refrigerator and inspect the contents. Remove any expired or spoiled items and dispose of them properly. This will create more space and make it easier to clean. You may also want to consider donating or repurposing any unopened items that you don't plan on using. 


### Remove All Contents

Take out all food, drink and condiments from the fridge. Place everything on a clean towel or on a counter until you finish the cleaning process. This will allow you to give each shelf and drawer a thorough scrubbing.

### Clean Interior Shelves and Drawers

Mix a solution of mild soap and warm water, or combine an equal parts of white vinegar and water. Wipe down each shelf and drawer with a warm damp cloth, using the cleaning solution. You can also add a few drops of tea tree oil or lemon juice to the mixture for extra disinfecting power. Rinse and dry thoroughly before placing everything back into the fridge.

### Put it Back Together

Once you’re finished, replace all of the food items and condiments, double-checking the expiration dates on unused items. Clean out the drip tray and any additional surfaces, such as the door.

When it comes to keeping your refrigerator in top shape, natural cleaning techniques are the way to go. Taking the time to deep clean your refrigerator will help keep your appliance in good condition, extending its life and keeping it looking its best.
