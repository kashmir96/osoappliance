## Troubleshoot Your LG Oven's F19 Error Code and Get Back in the Kitchen
Our ovens are used every day as we prepare meals for our families, so it can be a real cause of worry when an unexpected error code frozen the appliance.

If your LG oven is displaying a F19 error code, it usually means that the oven's temperature sensor is not working the way it should. Fortunately, the F19 error code doesn't usually require repair parts or expert service.

One of the simplest solutions to the F19 error code is to reset the oven's internal temperature system. Try unplugging it from the wall outlet, then plugging it back in and restarting the oven depending on your oven type. It's important to wait about a minute between unplugging and then plugging the oven back in. 

Try running the oven once more. If the F19 error comes up again, you may need to invest in a new temperature sensor. 

If the error is still present, you should also review the oven's user manual to check the temperature sensor connection to the control board. The connection should be snug and securely fastened. You can also check the wiring from the temperature sensor to the oven's main control board for signs of wear and tear or damage. 

If the issue persists and can't be resolved, you should reach out for the help of an experienced appliance repair technician. A technician can easily diagnose the cause and get your oven functioning properly again.

Regardless of whether you decide to repair the oven yourself or get help from a professional, getting your oven running again is key to ensuring you're able to enjoy cooking delicious meals for your family in your own kitchen.
