## A Guide to Resolving Air Conditioning Problems 

We all depend on our air conditioning to keep us comfortable in the summer, but it can be frustrating when it stops working. If this happens, rest assured that a malfunctioning air conditioner can usually be repaired quite easily. Here’s a guide to helping you get your air conditioner running again.

### Performing an Inspection 

The first step is to do a visual inspection to identify what may be causing the issue. Look for dust, debris, or damage to the coils, fins or other parts of the system. If there is debris, try to gently remove it. If you notice any damaged components, note where it is and whether it could be repaired by replacing just that one part or if a total replacement is needed. 

### Testing and Diagnosing

The next step is to test the unit and diagnose the problem. This can be tricky, since some repairs such as replacing a loose hose clamp require specific tools. If you don’t feel confident in your ability to diagnose and repair the problem, it may be best to call a professional technician. 

### Repairing

If the problem is minor and can easily be repaired at home, you’ll need to identify the necessary parts and buy them. Installing those parts yourself can save you money, but only attempt it if you’re confident of your repair skills.
