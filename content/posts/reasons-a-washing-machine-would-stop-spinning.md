# reasons a washing machine would stop spinning

If your washing machine has suddenly stopped spinning, it can be a sign of a few different problems. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to diagnose and potentially fix the issue.

1. Check the Lid Switch: The lid switch is responsible for telling the washing machine when the lid is closed. If the lid switch is faulty or broken, the washer won’t spin. To check this, open the lid and press the switch. If it doesn’t click, it’s likely the culprit.

Check your Door Lock: If you've got a front loader, you may have a door lock issue. This can prevent the washer from spinning. To check it, open the door and press down on the door lock. If it doesn’t click, it’s likely the culprit.

2. Check the Drive Belt: The drive belt is responsible for transferring power from the motor to the tub. If it’s worn out or damaged, it can cause the washer to stop spinning. To check it, remove the back panel and inspect the belt. If it’s cracked, worn out, or broken, it needs to be replaced.

3. Check the Motor: The motor is responsible for powering the spin cycle. If it’s faulty or has burnt out, it can cause the washer to stop spinning. To check it, remove the back panel and inspect the motor. If it’s damaged or worn out, it needs to be replaced.

4. Check the Timer: The timer is responsible for controlling the spin cycle. If it’s faulty or worn out, it can cause the washer to stop spinning. To check it, remove the back panel and inspect the timer. If it’s damaged or worn out, it needs to be replaced.

5. Check the Motor Brushes: The motor brushes are responsible for transferring power to the motor so it spins. If they’re worn out or damaged, it can cause the washer to stop spinning. To check them, remove the back panel and inspect the motor brushes. If they’re cracked, worn out, or broken, they need to be replaced.

6. Inspect your Pump: The pump is responsible for draining the water from the tub. If it’s faulty or worn out, it can cause the washer to stop spinning. To check it, remove the back panel and inspect the pump. If it’s damaged or worn out, it needs to be replaced.

7. Check the Hoses: The hoses are responsible for supplying water to the washer. If they’re blocked or kinked, it can cause the washer to stop spinning. To check them, open the back panel and inspect the hoses. If they’re blocked or kinked, they need to be replaced.

If none of these fixes work, it’s best to call a professional. They’ll be able to diagnose and fix the problem quickly and efficiently.
