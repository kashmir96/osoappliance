If you have a washing machine, chances are you’ve experienced some problems with it at one time or another. Washing machines can be quite finicky and troubleshooting the problem can be daunting. To help, here are some of the most common washing machine problems and how to fix them.

1. Not draining properly: If your washer is not draining properly, it may be caused by a clogged drain hose or pump filter. Start by unplugging the machine and checking for any blockages in the drain hose. If none are found, then check the filter for any lint or debris that could be blocking it. It’s also possible that your drain pump has failed and needs to be replaced.

2. Leaking water: Leaks from washing machines usually occur when hoses become loose or worn out over time. To fix this issue, start by checking all hoses for signs of wear such as cracks or holes and replace them if necessary. Also make sure to tighten any loose connections as these can cause leaks too. 

3. Shaking violently: If your washer is shaking excessively during its cycle, it may indicate an unbalanced load or a worn-out suspension spring in need of replacement. Try redistributing clothes within the drum so they are evenly distributed before starting a new cycle; if that doesn’t work then you will likely need to replace your suspension spring with a new one from an appliance parts store near you. 

4 .Not spinning properly: This could mean that there is something blocking the drum from spinning freely like a large item caught between two pieces of clothing or an excessive amount of foam in the tub due to over-sudsing detergent use . To fix this issue remove any obstructions from inside your washer’s drum and avoid using too much detergent per load if possible . 

5 . Not agitating properly : If your washer isn't agitating correctly , it's likely due to either something being caught under the agitator , a broken drive belt , or motor issues . Start by removing any items stuck under the agitator before replacing both belts with new ones if needed - then check your motor for further inspection . 

Hopefully these tips will help you diagnose and repair common washing machine problems quickly!
