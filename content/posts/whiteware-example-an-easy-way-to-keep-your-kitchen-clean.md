## An Effective Way to Maintain a Spotless Kitchen
 Keeping your kitchen clean and organized can be a difficult, and tedious task. Instead of spending hours scrubbing the surfaces, what if you could maintain the cleanliness and order of your kitchen with a few simple steps? White-ware is your answer!

White-ware refers to the white appliances in your kitchen, such as the refrigerator, oven, dishwasher, and microwave. With regular cleaning and upkeep, you can keep all of these appliances shining and looking new. These simple steps will explain how to achieve this goal. 

The first step is to get the necessary cleaning supplies. Choose a good degreaser and all-purpose cleaner, such as dish soap and baking soda. Make sure you search for cleaning supplies specifically designed for white appliances, since other cleaners could damage the material. 

Start by adding a cup of baking soda to the warm water. Let it sit for one to two minutes before you begin wiping the refrigerator, oven and dishwasher with a soft sponge. Allow the cleaning mixture to work its magic for a few minutes before you rise with warm water and dry. Do this regularly to prevent any buildup of dirt.

You can use the same cleaning solution to wipe down the microwave with a soft towel. Inside and outside you should wipe gently to avoid scratching the material. Additionally, to keep your kitchen smelling fresh and to kill germs, you can use a combination of water, vinegar, and lemon juice in a spray bottle, then wiping with a paper towel. 

Following these steps requires minimal effort and time, and will leave your white-ware appliances looking clean and spotless for a long time. With little to no scrubbing being needed, white-ware cleaning is an easy task that will take only a few minutes of your time every week. 

White-ware appliances are crucial elements of a fully functioning kitchen and are important to keep clean and in good condition. To make sure your appliances stay in top shape, these simple and straightforward steps will help you maintain the beauty and order of your kitchen.
