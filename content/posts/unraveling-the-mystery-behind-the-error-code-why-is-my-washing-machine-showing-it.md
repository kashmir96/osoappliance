## Unlocking the Secret Behind Washing Machine Error Codes 

Have you ever seen an error code on your washing machine and had no idea what it meant? Unraveling the mystery behind the error code and why your washing machine is displaying it can be puzzling. In this blog, we will discuss some common household appliance error codes, what they mean and how to resolve them. 

One of the most common washing machine error codes is the E10 code, which suggests that your water supply is not properly connected. To fix this, make sure that the supply hoses are securely connected to the water valves. The F11 code might be displayed if the water supply times out, which is usually caused by a defective inlet valve. If this is the case, you will likely need to replace the inlet valve to fix the issue. 

Another error code you might encounter is the E20 code. This code means that the drain hose is clogged and needs to be cleared. If the drain hose is clogged, it can cause water to back up in the washing machine, leading to an error code. The best way to fix this is to disconnect the drain hose and inspect it for any blockages or kinks that might be preventing water from flowing properly.
