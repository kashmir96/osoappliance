When it comes to finding a commercial washing machine for your business, it's important to consider all of your options before making a purchase. In New Zealand, the price of commercial washing machines can vary drastically depending on the type and size of machine you need. But in general, you can expect to pay around $3,000 - $7,000 for a top-of-the-line model.

The size and capacity of the commercial washing machine will also have an impact on its price. If you need a large capacity machine for a high volume laundry operation, you'll likely pay more than if you were just looking for something smaller and simpler. It's important to consider how much laundry your business needs to do each day in order to determine which size and capacity is best suited for your needs.

Another factor that affects the cost of a commercial washing machine is its energy efficiency rating (EER). The higher the EER rating, the more energy-efficient the washer will be - meaning lower electricity costs for your business over time. When comparing prices between different models, make sure that you look at their EER ratings as well as their initial cost so that you're getting the most bang for your buck!

Finally, different brands may also offer different prices on their commercial washers which can make deciding even more difficult! Do some research online or talk with local suppliers in order to get an idea of what kinds of deals are available before committing to any particular model or brand.

Overall, when shopping around for a new commercial washing machine in New Zealand there are many factors that come into play when considering cost - such as size and capacity requirements as well as energy efficiency ratings - so be sure to carefully evaluate all available options before settling on one model. With some research and comparison shopping though, you should be able to find an affordable yet reliable option perfect for your business' laundry needs!
