## What Time Do Laundromats Open: A Guide to Laundry Hours 
Do you need to know when your local laundromat opens? Or what hours it stays open? You may have noticed that laundromat hours are not always standard, so it's important to know the specific times of day that your local facility opens and closes. 

Most laundromats open their doors between 7am and 9am in the morning and close between 8pm and 11pm at night. However, some laundromats may have extended or different hours, so it’s important to check with your local facility. It’s also important to note that many laundry machines require a minimum amount of time for a load of laundry - usually 45 minutes or more - so make sure you plan accordingly if you want to get all your laundry done in one visit! 

In addition, some facilities offer special services such as free wifi while you wait for your clothes or even televisions with cable access. Always check with the staff before utilizing any added amenities as they usually require extra fees.
