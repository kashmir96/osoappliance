Having a range hood is an important part of any kitchen. It helps to keep the air clean and free of cooking odors, smoke, and grease. However, is it really necessary?

The short answer is that it depends. If you have a gas stove or cook with high-temperature oils often, then having a range hood is essential for ventilation purposes. Without one, you run the risk of smoke and grease building up in your kitchen over time which can be hazardous to your health. On the other hand, if you're typically only boiling water or reheating food on low settings, then the chances are slim that you'd need a range hood for ventilation purposes.

In terms of aesthetics and style though, having a range hood can be beneficial in making your kitchen look modern and up-to-date. Some people also like the extra counter space gained from not having one installed since they can use that space as extra storage or workspace instead. Additionally, some newer homes may already have built-in exhaust systems that make it unnecessary to install a separate range hood altogether. 

At the end of the day though, whether or not it's okay to not have a range hood really comes down to personal preference and how much cooking you do in your homeâ€™s kitchen area. If you're planning on doing more frequent high heat cooking then definitely consider installing one as soon as possible - both for safety reasons as well as aesthetically pleasing reasons!
