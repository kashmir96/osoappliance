A blocked drain could be the reason why your washing machine is not draining. No matter what type of washing machine you have – whether it’s a front-loading washer or a top-loader, drainage issues can be very frustrating. Before you contact an appliance repair serviceman from our directory, there are a few steps you should take to troubleshoot the issue and make sure it’s properly fixed.

First and foremost, check for any blockages in the drain hose or filter. This is especially important for front-loading washers since the hoses and filters get clogged more easily due to their design. If you find any kind of blockage in either one, simply remove it by hand or with tweezers if necessary. 

Next, check to make sure the hose leading from your washer to the drain pipe isn't clogged with lint or other debris that has accumulated over time. If so, then clean out as much of this debris as possible using a wet/dry vacuum or even just a cloth rag if need be. 

If neither of these solutions works, then it’s time to call in an appliance repair expert from our directory who can take care of the problem for you quickly and efficiently. They will first inspect your washing machine for any further signs of blockage before attempting any further repairs that may be necessary. 

In addition to checking for blockages in your drain hose and filter before calling an appliance repair serviceman from our directory, also make sure all connections are secure (especially between hoses). This will help ensure that no air leaks occur during draining which could lead to further problems down the line!
