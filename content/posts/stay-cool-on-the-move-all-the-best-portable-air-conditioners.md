## Beat The Heat With Portable Air Conditioners
Staying cool in the summer can be a real challenge — and often requires a little extra help beyond relying on a fan or open window. Portable air conditioners allow you to cool your home or office no matter where you are. Whether you are looking for a unit for a small room or larger space, there’s plenty of options available to help keep your environment feeling comfortable and cool.

The first thing to consider when looking for a portable air conditioner is size. Smaller models can be found to accommodate a single room, while larger units can provide chilling relief to multiple spaces. Additionally, how efficient the cooling is and how much energy it uses can be important factors to consider. Some units are even as convenient as movable trolleys for easy relocation. 

Other benefits of portable air conditioners can include a built-in dehumidifier to remove unwanted moisture and air purifier to reduce allergens such as dust, odours and smoke. Being able to adjust fan speed and temperature on a controller, as well as allowing cooling without having to open windows, are just some of the other benefits. 

Overall, portable air conditioners are a great choice when permanent air-conditioning is not a possibility. Once you’ve made the decision to invest in a unit, you’ll be grateful that you’re not suffering through the summer heat.
