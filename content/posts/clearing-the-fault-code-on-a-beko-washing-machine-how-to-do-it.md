## Clearing Fault Codes on a Beko Washing Machine

When a Beko washing machine enters an error code state, it tends to pause and won't be able to proceed with the task. If you encounter such an error, don't worry! Clearing the fault code on a Beko washing machine is easy enough and can be done quickly.

Before we jump in, one important point should be remembered - make sure you have accurately identified the error code. Every code has a different meaning, and attempting to clear the fault code without first identifying it will not resolve the issue. Once the issue has been pinpointed, the next step is to clear the fault code - and this is something which can be done in several different ways.

One of the easiest ways to clear the fault code is to simply turn off the machine for a few minutes. This will reset the error code - however, if the same fault code appears again soon afterwards, it is likely that something else is wrong with the machine and it would be best to seek external assistance. 

A second option which can be used if the error code persists after switching the machine off is to access the diagnostics mode. This can be done by pressing the "Delay" and "Quick Wash" keys simultaneously - or the "Delay" and "Spin" keys simultaneously, depending on the specific machine model - for five seconds or longer. 

In the diagnostics mode, the fault code can be eradicated. After this is done, the machine should be restarted and the cycle resumed.

If the problem persists after trying both of the above solutions, it could be due to various reasons. It may be that a part of the machine needs to be replaced, or that there is a bigger issue at play. In such a case, it is best to contact Bekoâ€™s customer service line or seek advice from a professional technician.

In summary, clearing the fault code on a Beko washing machine is relatively straightforward. However, if problems remain after attempted solutions the assistance of an appliance repair specialist would be recommended.
