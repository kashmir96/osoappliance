Dryer lint is more than just a nuisance you have to clean out of the filter. It can actually be used for a variety of creative and useful purposes, making it an ideal material for the average consumer.

From fire starters to homemade paper, there are many practical uses for dryer lint. Here are some examples:

1. Fire Starter – Dryer lint is highly flammable, making it perfect for starting fires in grills or campfires. Simply roll a handful into a ball and light it up! The bonus? This method is much safer than using lighter fluid or other chemicals and leaves no harsh odors behind. 

2. Packing Material – Dryer lint works great as an eco-friendly packing material and cushioning agent when shipping delicate items such as glassware or electronics. It’s lightweight, absorbent, and can easily be shaped around items to provide extra protection during transit. 
 
3. Homemade Paper – If you’re looking to get crafty, try making your own paper out of dryer lint! All you need is some water, flour (or cornstarch), and of course the dried up fabric pieces from your machine’s filter that make up the bulk of this DIY project. You can also add food coloring to give your paper some color if desired! 

Anyone who wants to be more sustainable or frugal with their materials can benefit from using dryer lint in these ways - from busy moms who need extra packing material when shipping packages off to grandparents during the holidays, all the way down to campers looking for alternative methods of starting fire without having to run back into town for lighter fluid! Plus, since dryer lint is free (aside from any costs associated with its collection), there’s no cost involved which makes it even more appealing!
