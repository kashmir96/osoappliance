A commercial fridge freezer is a type of refrigeration unit designed for the storage and preservation of food items in a commercial setting, such as restaurants, grocery stores and other food service establishments. Commercial fridges and freezers are generally larger than their residential counterparts and have more features to meet the demands of a professional kitchen.

The most common type of commercial fridge freezer is the reach-in style, which features two doors that open from opposite sides. This design allows for easy access to stored items without having to move them around or open multiple doors at once. Most models also come with adjustable shelves, drawers and racks so you can customize your storage space according to your needs. Reach-in fridges are available in single or double door models depending on how much space you need. 

Another popular option is the walk-in style commercial fridge freezer which has two walls with an aisle between them allowing staff members to walk into the cooler area without having to move any items around first. These units come in a variety of sizes ranging from small walk-ins suitable for smaller establishments up to large rooms sized ones made for large industrial kitchens. They often include shelving along both sides, making it easy to store different types of food products while still maintaining good visibility into each item stored inside. 

Finally, there are also undercounter refrigerator freezers which provide convenient storage solutions when space is limited but still require quick access to cold food items like meats or dairy products. These units usually fit underneath countertops or can be mounted onto walls if needed and can be used in combination with other equipment like ice makers or sandwich prep tables for added convenience and efficiency in any kitchen environment
