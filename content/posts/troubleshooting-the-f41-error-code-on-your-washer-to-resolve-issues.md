## Troubleshooting the F41 Error on Your Washer
Experiencing an error code on your washer can be daunting and confusing, especially when most of the time it just works! Taking the time to understand what an F41 error code on your washer means and how to address it can save you a lot of time and money.

The F41 error code on your washer indicates a motor rotor position sensing system malfunction. In general, this means that the grommet that reads the speed of the motor has a problem. This could be caused by a faulty motor rotor sensor, a disconnected motor rotor wire, or an out-of-spec rotor.

To troubleshoot this issue, the first step should be to check the sensor and its connections. Make sure the connections are secure and that the connector hasn't come loose. If the connection looks fine and the wire hasn't been damaged, then the next step should be to inspect the motor rotor. If the rotor is out of spec, it will need to be replaced. If the motor rotor appears to be in-spec, then the main control board will need to be replaced.

In any case, it is recommended that you contact a qualified appliance repair technician if you are experiencing any issues with your washer.
