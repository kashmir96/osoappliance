## Solving a GE Washer Code 18 Error
When the washer displays an error code, such as the GE Washer Code 18, it means that the machine needs help to continue its cycle. Understanding what the code stands for and what it means for your washer is key to knowing how to fix the problem.

When a GE Washer displays a Code 18, it means the water is not draining from the unit properly. The washer should sense the water level and then drain before it reaches a certain amount. If the washer fails to drain, the drain pump continues to run to avoid overflowing, resulting in the Error Code 18.

So how can you fix this issue? The first step is to check where the drain hose is connected to the drainpipe. The hose should be no more than 8 feet long and held in an upright position with no kinks. If this checks out, check the drainpipe itself - is it clogged and preventing the water from draining out? If it is, you’ll need to clear the obstruction and reset the washer cycle. Clearing a clog is often a straightforward process, but if you’re uncertain about plumbing, you could call in a professional. 

If the drainpipe and the hose are in good order, then the issue could be with the washer itself. This could mean there is a blockage somewhere in the drain pump or it’s seized up. You would need to call a technician or repairperson to rectify this problem.

If you’re experiencing GE Washer Error Code 18, it’s important to take the necessary steps to fix it. This could mean cleaning the drainpipe, removing any blockages, or even calling in a repairperson.
