A microwave kiln is a specialized type of high-temperature kiln designed to fire ceramics and glass. It’s a relatively new technology, but it has revolutionized the way artisans and hobbyists work with these materials. Compared to traditional firing methods, microwave kilns are much faster and more affordable. They also offer greater control over the firing process, allowing you to achieve specific results that would be impossible with other methods. 

The largest microwave kiln on the market is the Paragon SC2 Digital Fire Kiln. This powerful unit can fire pieces up to 8” in diameter and 3 ½” tall – nearly twice as large as many other models on the market. It also features two digital controllers for precise temperature adjustment during each cycle, as well as an automatic shut-off feature for safety. The digital controller allows you to set up a profile for your pieces, so you can customize each firing cycle according to your needs. 

The Paragon SC2 also boasts several advanced features that make it ideal for professional use or classroom instruction. These include adjustable heat-up times, programmable ramping speeds (for gradual temperature increases), and delay start functions (so you can begin firings at any time of day). The chamber size makes it great for large batches of small items or a few larger pieces at once – perfect if you need quick turnaround times on orders or projects! 

Overall, the Paragon SC2 is an incredibly powerful tool – one that gives professionals and hobbyists alike access to high-quality results without breaking their budget or sacrificing quality control over their firings! Whether you’re making jewelry, pottery, stained glass windows or another type of artwork – this model offers unprecedented power at an unbeatable price point!
