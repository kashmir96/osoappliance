If you’ve ever experienced the annoyance of your oven making a clicking noise, you know how disruptive it can be. This sound usually indicates a problem with the oven’s internal components, but thankfully there are some steps you can take before calling an appliance repair service person from our directory list.

First, check to make sure the igniter is functioning properly. The igniter is responsible for producing heat inside your oven and if it isn’t working correctly, this could be causing the clicking noise. To check if it is working properly, open the oven door and observe whether or not it glows when you turn on your oven. If it does not glow or only glows weakly, then that likely indicates a problem with the igniter and should be replaced as soon as possible.

If the igniter seems to be working properly, then another potential cause of clicking noises in your oven could be an issue with its fan motor. The fan motor helps circulate air throughout your oven so that food cooks evenly; if this component fails to work correctly then you may hear a loud clicking noise coming from inside your appliance when heaters are activated or when running self-cleaning cycles in some models of electric range ovens. You can test whether or not this is causing the issue by turning off power to your appliance and manually spinning its fan blades; if they move smoothly without any issue then there's no need for further investigation into this particular component being at fault for making sounds in one's stovetop.

In some cases though, clicking noises may also indicate an issue with one’s electronic control board – which controls all functions within one’s electric range including heating elements and fans – so make sure to inspect those components closely too! If these do not appear to be functioning properly either then unfortunately it might be best to call up an experienced technician who specializes in appliance repairs from our directory list!
