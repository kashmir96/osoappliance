The rice cooker is one of the most versatile and convenient kitchen appliances. It can be used to cook a variety of different types of foods, from plain white rice to complex dishes like biryani. However, there are some potential side effects associated with using a rice cooker that should be taken into consideration.

One of the most common side effects of using a rice cooker is overcooked or burnt food. If you don’t monitor your cooking time closely, it’s easy to end up with burned or mushy food that’s not appetizing at all. To avoid this, make sure you check on your food periodically and adjust the cooking time as necessary.

Another potential issue with using a rice cooker is potential contamination from bacteria and other microorganisms. If you don’t wash the pot properly and often enough, it can become contaminated with these organisms which could cause illness if consumed in large amounts. Always make sure to thoroughly clean your pot after every use and sanitize it regularly to prevent any contamination issues. 

Lastly, another potential problem with using a rice cooker is that they can be quite noisy while in operation. The sound level emitted by some models can reach up to 90dB, which is enough to cause hearing damage over time if exposed for an extended period of time without proper protection such as ear plugs or noise-canceling headphones. If possible, try to keep your kitchen well ventilated when using the appliance or opt for lower power models that aren’t as loud during operation. 

Overall, while there are some possible side effects associated with using a rice cooker, these issues are easily preventable if proper precautions are taken when operating the appliance such as monitoring cooking times closely and keeping it clean at all times. As long as you take these steps then you should have no trouble enjoying delicious meals cooked up in your trusty old rice cooker each night!
