When it comes to replacing a range hood, the amount of time required for the job depends on a number of factors. These include the size and type of range hood, any additional work that may be required to fit the new unit, and any existing ventilation or electrical work that will need to be addressed in order to complete the project. 

The installation process typically begins with removing your existing range hood. Depending on its size and complexity, this can take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or more. After it's removed, the next step is ensuring that all wiring is disconnected properly before proceeding with any further work. This should also take anywhere from minutes up to an hour depending on how complicated your current setup may be. 

Once you have successfully removed your existing hood and disconnected all necessary wiring, you can begin installing your new range hood. This process will vary depending on what type of unit you purchased, but generally speaking it should take about 30 minutes up to two hours for an average installation job. 

If there are additional components needed for your particular installation such as extra ductwork or venting systems then this may add another few hours onto the total timeline for completing this project. Additionally, if there are any plumbing or electrical issues that arise during installation then these too could add some extra time onto the overall timeframe of replacing your range hood. 
Overall though, most people should expect their replacement range hoods to take somewhere between 1-3 hours depending on what type of unit theyâ€™ve purchased and what sort of existing setup they have in place before starting their project.
