If you own a Whirlpool dryer and need to find the heating element, it can be a bit of a challenge. Fortunately, this guide will help you locate the heating element on your dryer so that you can properly maintain it.

The heating element on a Whirlpool dryer is located in the back of the drum. To access it, you will need to first remove the back panel of the dryer. This can usually be done by removing two or three screws from the rear panel. Once these screws are removed, you should be able to lift up and off the back panel with ease. 

Once you have exposed the inside of your dryer, look for a large cylindrical part that is connected to two wires. This is your heating element and should be easy enough to spot since it is usually one of the largest components inside your dryer. It is important to note that there may also be other wiring connected to this component as well as other components like thermostats and fuses which are used for controlling temperature and other aspects of your dryers operation. 

Once you have located the heating element, inspect it for any signs of damage or wear such as cracks or discoloration which can indicate that it needs replacing. If all looks good then simply replace any screws removed from earlier and reattach the back panel before plugging in your appliance again for use. 

By following these steps, locating and inspecting your Whirlpool dryers heating element should now be much easier than before! Remember that if any damage or wear is found then replacing this component should always take priority over other maintenance tasks in order to keep your appliance running safely and efficiently at all times!
