## Understanding and Resolving LG Washing Machine Error Code OE 
When your LG washing machine experiences an issue, it displays an error code. Understanding and diagnosing these codes is the first step to finding a fix. This blog post covers how to read LG's error code OE, how to troubleshoot the error, and how to fix it. 

Error code OE typically appears when there is an issue with the draining system. It may indicate that the washing machine is not draining water completely, or that the pump is unable to move water out of the washer. There can be several causes of this issue, and these possible causes will vary depending on the type of LG machine you have. 

The first step to resolving this issue is to troubleshoot the washing machine. First, make sure the wash cycle dial is moved to the Drain/Spin position, that your washing machine is level, and that the drain hose is placed higher than the level of water in the washer. If your washing machine is stacked, make sure the weight of the dryer on top is evenly distributed across the bottom. If the machine is not level, try adjusting the legs to level it out. 

If the issue persists, you may need to replace the drain pump. Even if your machine also displays other error codes such as LE or mE, unplug the washer and try replacing the drain pump. To do this, you will need to detach the front panel and the top of the washer. Then, unplug the hoses, disconnect the drain pump and wires, and reinstall the new part. Make sure to properly secure the wiring and hoses as you re-assemble the machine. 

Finally, if you're uncomfortable with making any repairs yourself, you can always contact a professional service technician.
