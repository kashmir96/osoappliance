An air fryer oven is a type of kitchen appliance that uses hot air to cook food. It is an alternative to traditional deep-frying and can help create healthier dishes. Air fryers work by circulating hot air around food, which cooks it quickly and evenly. The result is crispy, delicious fare without the added fat or calories from oil-based cooking methods.

Air fryer ovens come in a variety of sizes and shapes, ranging from small countertop models to larger units with multiple shelves for more cooking space. The biggest air fryer ovens are typically bulky and take up a lot of counter space, but they are also capable of accommodating large batches of food or several dishes at once—making them ideal for large families or entertaining groups. Some larger models even have additional features such as steam functions, convection bake capabilities, rotisserie racks and removable baskets for easy storage and cleaning. 

When choosing an air fryer oven, consider the size you need based on what you plan to cook in it most often—for instance if you’ll be making meals for a family of four or more versus single-serving snacks like French fries or chicken wings. Also consider how much counter space you have available; big models will require more room than smaller ones do. 

In addition to their convenience factor, another great thing about bigger air fryers is that they can save money over time compared to constantly buying oil needed for deep frying foods like french fries or chicken wings in traditional methods . Plus they offer healthier alternatives with fewer calories since no extra oil needs to be added into the mix during cooking—a win/win situation! 

Overall if you’re looking for an efficient way to make meals quickly while still keeping them healthy then investing in one of the bigger air fryer ovens may be right choice for your kitchen needs!
