## Is 55 Decibels Loud for a Dishwasher?

Noise levels are an important factor when considering which dishwasher to purchase. A dishwasher that is too quiet may not be powerful enough to handle the workload, while one that is too loud may become a nuisance after installation. So, is 55 decibels loud for a dishwasher?

The average decibel level of a dishwasher is between 45 and 65 decibels. At 55 decibels, most dishwashers would be considered average in terms of noise. A dishwasher operating at this level will be quieter than a conversation between two people, but louder than the humming of a refrigerator.

It is important to consider the sound of your dishwasher in the context of your kitchen or laundry room. A dishwasher running at 55 decibels can still be noticeable in small and closed off areas, such as a kitchen or a laundry room. If you plan on installing your dishwasher in a room that is not well ventilated, you may want to opt for a quieter model.

When shopping for a dishwasher, be sure to take note of the noise ratings. It is not uncommon to find dishwashers listed in decibels, but some manufacturers may refer to the noise rating in sones. As a general rule of thumb, one sone is equivalent to 40 decibels.

When all is said and done, a dishwasher operating at 55 decibels is a bit louder than the average noise level, but not by much. If you would rather purchase a quieter dishwasher, there are a few models available that are capable of running at 50 decibels or less.
