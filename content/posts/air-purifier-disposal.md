Are you looking to get rid of your old air purifier? If so, you are not alone! Air purifiers can be great for improving indoor air quality and reducing allergens but they do eventually need to be replaced. With that in mind, it’s important to dispose of them properly. 

The first step is to make sure the device is no longer in use. If you have a new air purifier or just don’t need this one anymore, unplug it from the wall and remove any filters. Now is also a good time to wipe down the outside of the unit with a damp cloth and remove any dust or dirt that has accumulated on it over time. 

Once you have finished prepping your air purifier for disposal, there are a few different options available: 
• You can recycle your air purifier through an electronics recycling program. Many municipalities have programs where you can drop off old electronics for free – simply search online for electronic recycling near me or contact your local waste management office for more information. 
• You can also donate your old air purifier to someone else who may benefit from it. Consider donating it to a local charity organization or thrift store that accepts used electronics donations – this way, someone else will still get some use out of your old device! 
• Finally, if none of those options are available in your area, then you may need to just throw away the unit in regular trash collection. Make sure all removable parts such as filters and cords are removed before doing so – this will help prevent any potential environmental hazards caused by improper disposal of these items. 

No matter how you choose to dispose of your old air purifier, following these simple steps will ensure that it is done safely and responsibly!
