Air cleaners are becoming increasingly popular in homes and businesses as people look for ways to improve air quality and reduce health risks associated with airborne pollutants. These devices use different technologies to remove airborne contaminants from the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, mold spores, bacteria, and other particles. The most popular types of air cleaners are HEPA filters, activated carbon filters, ozone generators, ionizers and ultraviolet (UV) light systems. 

HEPA filters are the most common type of air cleaner found in homes and businesses. HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air filter. They work by trapping small particles such as dust mites, mold spores and pet dander in their fibers. The best HEPA filters can remove up to 99% of particles down to 0.3 microns in size from the air passing through them. 

Activated carbon filters also work to reduce airborne particulates by using a porous carbon material that traps particles on its surface as they pass through it. This type of filter is often used alongside a HEPA filter for additional protection against smoke or chemical odors like those from solvents or paint fumes. 

Ozone generators are devices that produce ozone (O3) molecules which react with organic compounds like those found in smoke or paint fumes to neutralize their odor or toxicity levels when they come into contact with each other. Ozone generators can be used alone or with an activated carbon filter depending on what kind of contaminants you want to eliminate from your home’s air supply. 

Ionizers use electrically charged ions to attract airborne particulates so that they stick together instead of floating freely around your home’s interior space where they can be inhaled into your lungs or cause irritation if breathed directly into your nose and throat area. The best ionizers have adjustable settings so you can adjust their intensity according to how much pollution there is present in your home environment at any given time without having it overpower everything else going on inside the room at that moment too much either way! 

 Finally there are UV light systems which use ultraviolet light rays emitted from a bulb placed inside an enclosed chamber within an air purifier housing unit itself; these rays break down any harmful microorganisms like bacteria floating around in the surrounding atmosphere before returning clean filtered oxygen back out into the living space again! This process is especially beneficial for anyone suffering from asthma allergies who may find relief by having one installed near their bedside!
