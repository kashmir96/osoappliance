Health effects of a dirty air conditioner filter can be serious, especially for those with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory issues. Dirty air conditioner filters can cause a range of health problems, including:

1. Poor air quality: When an A/C filter becomes clogged with dust and dirt particles, it begins to restrict airflow through the system. This means that not only is the air less clean and fresh but it’s also more difficult for your lungs to take in oxygen. Over time, this can lead to coughing and wheezing as well as eye irritation and headaches due to poor indoor air quality. 

2. Respiratory Illness: Air conditioners are designed to filter out allergens like pollen, dust mites and pet dander from your home’s air supply. However, when the filter becomes dirty these allergens are no longer being kept at bay which can lead to an increased risk of developing a respiratory illness such as bronchitis or pneumonia. 

3. Mold Growth: Dirty A/C filters can also lead to condensation build-up in the system which provides a perfect breeding ground for mold growth in your ducts or vents—and that means even more allergens in your home’s air supply! Not only does mold pose serious health risks but it damages the efficiency of your system too so replacing dirty filters on time is essential! 

Overall, it’s clear that having a dirty A/C filter is bad news for both our homes and our health – so make sure you remember to keep up with regular maintenance by changing out your filters every 3 months or so!
