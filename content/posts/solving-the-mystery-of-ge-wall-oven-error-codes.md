## Unlocking the Solutions to GE Wall Oven Error Codes

It’s never fun when your GE wall oven gives you an error code -- it can mean powering off the oven and having to endure your food taking extra time to cook. But by understanding what the codes mean, you can assess the situation and determine whether you can tackle the fix on your own or if it’s time to call a technician.

An error code tells you exactly where the problem lies -- in the oven’s control board, power system, relay board, etc. If the code relates to an issue with either the electrical wiring, heating elements, thermostat, latch, etc, you may be able to resolve the issue yourself with a few simple steps. 

To help decipher and solve GE wall oven error codes, we’ve created an appliance error codes glossary. This guide provides a description of the code, the likely cause, and a method to resolve the issue. Depending on the code, the fix ranges from pressing a reset button to cleaning the oven’s vent tube.

The guide also identifies errors related to the electrical power system, such as a blown fuse or circuit breaker. These codes will require the services of a certified technician as rerouting or replacing the wiring and power system is not something you can safely do yourself.

When your oven display shows an error code, take the time to investigate the error code before you assume something is wrong. Our error codes guide can help you decipher the code and provide a potential solution to get your oven up and running again quickly and safely.
