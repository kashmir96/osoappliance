Red is an important color to pay attention to when it comes to your stove. If the light on your stove is red, it means that it is still hot and you should use caution when touching it. Red lights on stoves are usually accompanied by a warning label or sign that reminds you not to touch the hot surface.

The red light indicates that the stove is still in its heating phase and has not yet cooled down. This is because stoves take a while to cool down after they have been used; this is why you should be careful when touching them after they have been used.

When the red light on your stove turns off, it means that the stove has cooled down and is safe to touch. It’s important to wait until the red light turns off before you attempt to clean or move any of the components of your stove, as these could still be hot and cause burns if touched too soon.

In addition to being a warning sign, red can also indicate that something needs to be done with your stove. For example, if your oven’s temperature is set too high, a red light may appear as a warning sign that it needs to be adjusted. 

Overall, red lights on stoves are important indicators of safety and should not be ignored. Pay attention to the red lights so that you can avoid getting burned or damaging your appliance.
