Most of us have experienced a mysterious rumbling or thumping sound coming from our washing machines at one time or another. It can be annoying and even cause concern if you’re not sure why it’s happening. It turns out, the most common reason why your Samsung washing machine makes noise when spinning is due to an unbalanced load. 

When your washer is overloaded with clothes, the weight of the items can throw off the balance of the machine and cause it to make a loud noise. The remedy is simple: redistribute your clothing items around inside the drum so that they are evenly distributed.

If you’ve already tried this and the sound persists, there are some other things you should try before calling an appliance repair service. 

1. Check for any blockages in your washer’s hose or drain pipe that may be causing a disruption in its spin cycle. 

2. Make sure all hoses are connected correctly and securely to ensure proper drainage as well as ensure that no air bubbles can disrupt your machine’s performance. 

3. If possible, check for any loose screws or parts in your washing machine by tilting it slightly on its side and checking underneath it for any pieces that may have come loose over time due to wear-and-tear or vibration during cycles. 

4. Inspect the outer tub of your washer to see if it has become damaged somehow, which could be causing vibration while spinning if left unchecked. 

5. Finally, take a look at the suspension springs on both sides of the washer; these components help keep your washing machine stable during operation but can sometimes become worn down over time leading to excessive noise when spinning due to poor stability control from within the washing machine itself! 

If none of these steps resolve your issue, then you should consider enlisting an appliance repair professional from our directory list who can diagnose and fix any underlying problems with ease!
