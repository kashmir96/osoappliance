## Keeping Dehydrator Trays Clean

Many people don't realize the importance of regularly cleaning their dehydrator trays. However, not properly caring for them can cause mold, drop in food's overall quality, and even cause a difference in taste. But don't worry, it's still easy to ensure the state and functionality of your trays to last for years to come.

To begin, you should make it a habit to clean the trays of your dehydrator after each use. Food particles do tend to stick to melted ingredients and meat juices, easily creating a perfect environment for bacteria to grow. A simple wash in warm water with mild detergent should do the trick.

It's important to regularly replace the parchment paper linings of your dehydrator as well. Doing this will not only keep food particles from sticking to the trays but also save you time trying to clean off tough residue. You might also rotate the trays if necessary to even out the energy distribution inside the unit.

Using a calcium-free descaler such as white vinegar is recommended for wiping down the outside of the dehydrator. Place a few drops on a damp cloth and wipe hard-to-reach areas like fans, crevices, and seams.

Additional tips for maintaining the trays of your dehydrator include ensuring trays are completely dry before assembling them back in the unit. It's also beneficial to remove stubborn spots by lightly scrubbing with either a soft cloth or your choice of cleaning material.

Keeping the trays of your dehydrator clean is the key to ensuring that the unit functions appropriately and produces the best possible food quality. Regularly cleaning and replacing the parchment paper linings along with regular descaling should be part of your everyday dehydrating routine!
