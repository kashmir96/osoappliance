## My Dryer is Screeching - What Can I Do?

If you’re like most of us, the sound of a screeching dryer can be extremely distressing. Not only is the sound loud and annoying, but it can be a sign that something is wrong with your appliance. Knowing what steps to take can help you identify the cause and determine if you need to call a repair technician. 

The first step is to identify what kind of sound is coming from the dryer. If it is a screeching sound, then it is most likely a belt issue, as the belt can become cracked and worn out over time. To check the belt, unplug your dryer, and then turn it around so that you can access the back. You should be able to see the belt that runs around the drum and this is the source of the screeching sound. If the belt has frayed or cracked, then it likely needs to be replaced.

In some cases, a screeching sound may also be an indication of a broken roller or roller bearing. Rollers help keep the drum in place and allow it to rotate smoothly, so if it is broken or worn out, it can cause a loud screeching sound. If this is the case, then the roller or roller bearing will need to be replaced in order to stop the noise.

If the screeching noise continues, it may be a sign of a clogged dryer vent. Clogged dryer vents not only cause the appliance to work harder, they can also produce a high-pitched screeching sound. If this is the case, then the vent should be cleaned to ensure that it is clear of any lint and debris.

No matter the reason for the screeching noise, if you are unable to identify and fix the problem, then it may be time to call an appliance repair technician. A reputable technician will be able to assess the problem and make the necessary repairs to ensure that your dryer runs safely and efficiently.
