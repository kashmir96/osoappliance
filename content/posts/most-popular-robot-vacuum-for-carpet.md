Robot vacuums are the perfect solution for busy households and those who want to keep their carpets spick and span with minimal effort. But when it comes to carpeted surfaces, not all robot vacuums are created equal. The most popular robot vacuums for carpets feature powerful suction, reliable navigation systems, and thoughtful extras that make cleaning easier than ever before.

The iRobot Roomba s9+ is one of the top rated robot vacuums for carpets. This powerful cleaner includes a range of features that make it ideal for any carpeted surface. Its superior suction power ensures dirt and debris are thoroughly lifted from even thick pile carpets, while its advanced navigation system allows it to move around furniture with ease. The s9+ also features an exclusive CleanBase automatic dirt disposal system that automatically empties out dirt into a reusable bag after each cleaning cycle – so you never have to manually empty out the vacuum’s bin again! 

The Neato Botvac D7 Connected is another top-rated robot vacuum designed specifically for homes with mostly carpeted floors. It uses laser mapping technology to navigate around furniture and accurately clean every section of your home’s flooring without getting stuck or missing a single spot. Its powerful suction deep cleans even thicker carpets, while its unique spiral combo brush lifts deep embedded debris more effectively than other robotic vacuums on the market today. Additionally, this model is compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands so you can start or stop your cleaning cycles hands-free! 

Finally, the Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 900 is another popular choice among homeowners looking for a reliable robotic vacuum cleaner specifically designed for carpeted surfaces. This model boasts an impressive 3-stage cleaning system that combines powerful suction with precise mopping capabilities – perfect for tackling tough messes on both hardwood floors and low pile rugs alike! And thanks to its advanced Smart Navi 2 0 technology, this model maps out your home’s layout in order to create customized maps before starting each cleaning cycle – ensuring every area of your home gets thoroughly cleaned no matter how small or large it may be! 

Finding the right robotic vacuum cleaner can be difficult but these three models prove there’s no need worry when shopping around specifically looking at robots made just right for carpets!
