## Getting Your Old Refrigerator Working Again

If your old, restored refrigerator has been acting up lately and isn't running at peak efficiency, it's time to get it working again. Rather than buying a new appliance, restoring your vintage appliance is a fun, cost-effective way to update your kitchen. Here are a few pointers to get your restoration fridge back up and running. 

First, turn off the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. This allows the compressor and condenser coils to cool off and reset. After it's turned off, you'll want to unplug the power cord from the power outlet. Adjust the temperature knob to the “coolest” setting, then plug the power cord back into the power outlet.

Next, check to make sure your refrigerator door is closed tightly and securely. If you notice any gaps or cracks in the door's seal, you’ll want to repair them before you turn the refrigerator back on. You can use weatherstripping or packing tape to repair these gaps. 

Finally, use the temperature control knob on the back of your refrigerator to adjust the temperature. Start with the lowest setting, then slowly work your way up until the refrigerator is an appropriate temperature. 

Fixing your restoration refrigerator isn't a difficult project as long as you plan ahead and make sure to check all of the basics. If you're having trouble with other appliances in your house, you may want to consider contacting a local appliance repair technician. Our directory of experienced appliance repair technicians can help you get your household appliances back in working order in no time.
