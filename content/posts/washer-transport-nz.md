If you need to transport a washing machine from one place to another, then you have a few options when it comes to New Zealand. Depending on your budget and the distance that needs to be covered, you can opt for either a professional moving company or a self-service option.

Who Needs It?

Anyone who needs to move their washing machine from one location to another will need some form of transport. This could be people who are moving house, commercial businesses that need to transport equipment, or even people who are buying or selling a washing machine. Regardless of the circumstances, having some form of transportation is essential. 

Why Would They Need It? 
Moving a washing machine involves more than just picking it up and taking it somewhere else. There are special considerations that need to be taken into account such as weight, size and fragility of the item being moved. Furthermore, carrying a washing machine requires considerable strength and experience in order to ensure its safe arrival at its destination.

For those looking for a self-service option then the cost could range from NZ$2 per km up to NZ$4 per km depending on the size of the item being transported and the distances involved. 

Overall, there are several options available when it comes to transporting your washing machine in New Zealand so make sure you do your research before committing yourself financially!
