Stove parts are essential components of keeping your stove in good working order. They can range from relatively inexpensive to very expensive, depending on what part needs to be replaced. In Christchurch, some of the most common parts needing to be replaced are the oven elements, gas burners, and thermostats.

Oven elements are typically between $25 and $50 each, and can be fairly easy to install if you have a bit of technical knowledge. They simply replace the existing element in the oven, and can be found at most hardware stores or appliance shops.

Gas burners can range from around $15 for a single burner replacement up to around $100 for a full set of burners. Again these are fairly easy to install if you have some technical know-how and require no special tools or equipment. They too can usually be found at hardware stores or appliance shops. 

Thermostats tend to be more expensive than oven elements or gas burners as they need to fit perfectly into your stove’s existing wiring system in order for them to work correctly. An average thermostat should cost somewhere between $50 - $150 depending on its capabilities; however it is important that you get one that is compatible with your particular model of stove as they all vary slightly in terms of their specifications. As with the other parts mentioned above, they should also be available from any good hardware store or appliance shop in Christchurch. 

In terms of installation difficulty, oven elements and gas burners would both classed as ‘easy’ whereas changing a thermostat would likely require some experience with electrical wiring so could potentially classed as ‘medium’ difficulty level – although there are plenty of online guides available offering step-by-step instructions for anyone looking for assistance when replacing this part! 

Overall then it is clear that there are lots of different types of stove parts available in Christchurch – so whatever you need replacing you should have no problem finding it! The key thing is just making sure that you get the correct part for your particular model as this will ensure that everything fits together properly when installed – ultimately saving you time (and money!) down the line!
