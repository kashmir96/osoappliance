## Know the Basics Behind Error Code 4C on a Samsung Washing Machine 

Are you dealing with an error code 4C on your Samsung washing machine? This can be a frustrating and confusing experience. Read on to find out what you need to know and how to properly address the issue. 

Error code 4C typically means a power issue. It typically occurs when the power is cut off the appliance while the cycle is happening. The solution can be to unplug the washing machine, wait 10 seconds, and then plug it back in again. Make sure that you turn the water source off before you do this as well. It may take up to 20 minutes afterwards for the machine to reset before you start a new cycle.

If this does not work, there may be another underlying issue. Consider disconnecting the power for an extended time and then plugging it back in again. If you do this, you will need to open the door to it and let the water out before you power it off. Make sure that all of the excess water has been cleared out before you attempt to reset the machine. 

If resetting doesn’t work, it’s possible your washing machine has internal damage or issues that need to be repaired. If you feel that is the case it’s best to have a qualified technician come in and inspect the machine to make sure that all of the issues are addressed safely and correctly.
