# Panasonic washing machine wont spin

If your Panasonic washing machine won't spin, it can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue and get your washing machine back in working order.

The first step is to check the power supply. Make sure that the power cord is securely plugged into the wall outlet and that the outlet is providing power. If the power cord is plugged in, try unplugging it and plugging it back in. If the outlet is not providing power, reset the circuit breaker or replace the fuse.

Next, check the washing machine's settings. Make sure that the spin cycle is selected and that the water level is set correctly. If the settings are correct, try resetting the washing machine by unplugging it for 30 seconds and then plugging it back in.

If the washing machine still won't spin, it may be due to a worn belt or a defective motor. To check the belt, open the washing machine and inspect the belt for signs of wear. If the belt is worn, it will need to be replaced. If the belt looks fine, the motor may need to be replaced.

Finally, if the washing machine still won't spin, it may be due to a clogged drain hose or pump. To check the drain hose, disconnect it from the washing machine and inspect it for clogs. If the hose is clogged, clear the clog and reconnect the hose. To check the pump, open the washing machine and inspect the pump for signs of wear. If the pump is worn, it will need to be replaced.

Panasonic machines have also been known to carry issues with the control panel and main PCB, which are both expensive repairs. If the control panel or main PCB is the issue, it will need to be replaced by an expert.

By following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and fix the issue with your Panasonic washing machine. If the issue persists, it may be best to contact a professional for further assistance.
