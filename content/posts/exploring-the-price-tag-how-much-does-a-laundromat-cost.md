## Figuring Out the Price of a Laundromat

Starting and running a laundromat is a great way to make money and provide a valuable service to the community. There’s been an increase in demand for laundromat rental as more people are renting over owning. And when opening a laundromat, the most important factor to consider is the price tag. So, how much does a laundromat cost?

The total cost of owning a laundromat will depend on the size, location, and your desired amenities. For example, an large, urban laundromat is going to cost significantly more than a smaller, suburban shop. Generally speaking, the average cost to open and operate a laundromat is between $125,000 and $400,000. This doesn’t look at startup costs such as equipment, water and drainage, and permits. 

The average price of a washer is between $300 and $2,500. Dryers are even more expensive, costing up to $10,000 each, however prices vary depending on the size and type of dryer. Other costs you need to factor in are vending machines, soap, and laundromat signage. 

In addition to startup costs, operational costs must be taken into account, such as electricity, water, detergent, employees and cleaning services. Overall, laundromat ownership is an investment but one that can be extremely beneficial in the long run.

The cost of a laundromat may seem high, but there are other options available such as appliance rental. When you rent, you can get the appliances you need at a fraction of the cost. Plus, you don’t have to worry about maintenance or repairs – that’s all taken care of by the rental company.
