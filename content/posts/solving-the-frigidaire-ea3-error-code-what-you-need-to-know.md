This error can happen at any time, leaving your appliance malfunctioning and you wondering what's going on. Knowing what the EA3 code means and what to do in case of it occurring can save you time and money.

The EA3 error code on a Frigidaire appliance indicates a failed defrost cycle. The evaporator fan motor or control board in the appliance may be malfunctioning and causing this failure. To fix the problem, you’ll need to reset the defrost cycle on your refrigerator or freezer, or replace the motor or control board.

If you're the type of person who likes to handle things yourself, you can use an ohmmeter to manually test the evaporator fan motor and ensure it’s running.

If these components test OK, but you’re still getting the EA3 error code, then you’ll need to replace the motor or control board.

It’s important to note that the EA3 error code can often be caused by a faulty connection between the evaporator and the power supply.
