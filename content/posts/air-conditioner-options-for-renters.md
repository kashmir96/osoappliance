Summer is here, and with it comes the heat. For renters, air conditioning can be a tricky thing. Depending on the rental agreement and your landlord’s policies, you may not be able to install a central air conditioning system in your rental home or apartment. But don’t despair—there are still plenty of air conditioner options for renters that can help keep you cool in the summer heat. 

One of the most popular air conditioning options for renters is a portable AC unit. These units don’t require any permanent installation, so they’re great for renters who want to keep their living space cool without making any major changes to their rental agreements. Portable AC units come in various sizes and styles, so you can find one that fits your needs and budget. Plus, they’re relatively easy to install and operate—all you have to do is plug them into an outlet and turn them on! 

Another great option for renters is a window AC unit. These units fit into most standard-size windows (so make sure to measure yours before buying one) and provide effective cooling power even on hot days. Window AC units are also relatively easy to install—all you have to do is mount it into your window frame with some screws or bolts (which should be included with the unit). And because window AC units are designed for single rooms or small spaces, they don’t take up much energy or cause too much noise either! 

Finally, if you want something more powerful than a portable or window AC unit but don’t want to go through the hassle of installing an entire central air system in your rental home or apartment, consider investing in a ductless mini-split system instead. Ductless mini-splits provide efficient cooling power while taking up very little space—you just need two small indoor “blower units” connected by tubing (which carries coolant) outside of your home where they connect with an outdoor compressor unit that pumps cooled air into your living space via vents placed around the room(s). This type of system requires professional installation but still provides efficient cooling without taking up too much energy or space inside your living space! 

No matter which type of air conditioner you choose for your rental home or apartment this summer, make sure it meets all safety requirements set by both local authorities as well as any rules set out by your landlord prior to purchase/installation!
