Next, consider the severity of the problem. If the issue is minor, you may be able to troubleshoot the issue and repair it yourself. There are lots of helpful online resources and helpful tips to help you mend your appliance. However, for major repairs, it may be best to find a qualified and reliable technician.

Before your appointment, thoroughly clean your appliance. Even if the appliance is broken, the technician will be able to easily assess the issue if there is no dirt and dust in the way. 

Finally, be sure to keep your receipt and any other documents related to the repair. Doing this will make it easier to keep track of any ongoing repairs.
