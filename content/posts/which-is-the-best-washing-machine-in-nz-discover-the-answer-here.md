## Searching for the Best Washing Machine in NZ

Are you overwhelmed by the number of washing machines that are available on the market today? Finding a good quality machine that is affordable and fits into your budget can seem like a difficult task. Thankfully, thereâ€™s no need to worry. This blog will explore some of the best washing machines available to New Zealanders, so that you can make the right decision and get the most value for money. 

Washing machines come in a variety of sizes and styles. From top loading to front loading, there are loads of options to choose from. Some machines are designed for heavy duty use, while others are more suitable for lighter loads. Size is also a factor, as smaller machines usually only handle a few loads at once, while more spacious models can tackle larger heaps of laundry. It really depends on how much laundry needs to be done on a regular basis to determine what is the best washing machine for you.

When it comes to energy efficiency, all washing machines are graded on a scale of A-G. This rating lets you know how energy efficient the appliance is, making it much easier to select an energy-saving model. Look out for other features, too, such as automatic water and temperature controls and adjustable spin speed. These options are great for saving time and effort, as well as keeping laundry costs down.

Overall, the brand Bosch have been highly-rated for their washing machines. Quiet, efficient and hard-wearing, Bosch machines have consistently come out on top for value, quality and performance. Plus, all their machines come with a two year warranty for added peace of mind.

Another top option for a washing machine is the Samsung Ecobubble. It has a large 8kg drum, which allows you to fit in more laundry per load and save money on energy bills. With its bubble generator, it uses less water and detergent, making it a great Eco-friendly choice.

When it comes to finding the best washing machine for you, the key is to compare products based on features, capacity and energy efficiency. Read up on customer reviews, too, as they provide some valuable insight into the quality and performance of a particular model.
