It's frustrating when you start a load of laundry in your washing machine only to find out that the cycle never ends. This issue can be caused by a number of different factors, most commonly imbalanced loads, faulty shock absorbers, broken drain pumps, faulty timers or broken PCB boards. 

When your washing machine is loaded unevenly, it can cause the washer to become off balance and not spin properly. If the load is too large for one side of the drum to handle, it will spin in circles rather than in an oval shape like it should. This imbalance can cause the motor to run continuously and not stop at the end of its cycle. To prevent this from happening, make sure that you evenly distribute any bulky items so they don't all go on one side of the drum. 

Another common cause of a washing machine cycle that never ends is faulty shock absorbers. These devices help reduce vibrations during operation and allow for a smooth spin and transition between cycles. If these parts are worn out or have been damaged in some way then they will not function properly and can cause your washer to go through an infinite loop when trying to complete its cycle. You may need to replace these parts if they are worn down or damaged beyond repair. 

Faulty drain pumps can also lead to a washing cycle that never ends. These pumps help move the water out of the machine and into your homeâ€™s wastewater system. If these parts are malfunctioning, then it can cause your washer to fill up with water and not properly drain which will result in an infinite loop of washing. 

Faulty timers or broken PCB boards are also common causes of a washing machine cycle that never ends. The timer is responsible for controlling when the cycles start and end while the PCB board is responsible for regulating power to all components of the washer. If either of these parts are malfunctioning then it can cause your washer to stay stuck in a continuous loop until they are fixed or replaced. 

In conclusion, if you find yourself dealing with a washing machine cycle that never ends then it's important to identify and address the underlying problem as soon as possible. Common issues include imbalanced loads, faulty shock absorbers, faulty drain pumps, faulty timers or broken PCB boards. Once you have identified the issue it's important to get it repaired right away so you can get back to doing laundry hassle free!
