## Troubleshooting Miele Dishwasher Problems 

Miele dishwashers are highly rated and reliable products. However, like other major appliances, it may experience problems from time to time. In this blog post, we will discuss some of the common Miele dishwasher issues and how to resolve them. 

One of the most common issues with Miele dishwashers is the door not shutting properly. This can be a result of the dishwasher being out of level or the door gasket being worn out. To fix this issue, make sure that your dishwasher is level. If the dishwasher is level, then it may be necessary to replace the door gasket.

Another issue that Miele dishwashers may experience is a malfunctioning delay start feature. If you notice that the start time for the dishwasher is different than the one you have set, then the delay start might be malfunctioning. The best way to fix this issue is to reset the timing functions.

A problem that some people report with their Miele dishwashers is vibrating or loud noise when running. This can be caused by objects hitting the inside of the dishwasher and making contact with the spray arm. To fix this, make sure that all objects such as dishes and glasses, etc. are not touching the spray arm. Additionally, make sure the dishwasher is properly balanced before running a cycle.

Finally, one of the most frustrating Miele dishwasher issues is that it won't start. This can have several causes, such as the water supply being cut off or the start button not functioning properly. To fix this issue, check the circuit breaker and make sure that the power to the dishwasher is on. If the power is on, then make sure that the start button is functioning correctly. If all else fails, then contact a professional appliance repair technician.

In conclusion, Miele dishwashers are well-made appliances, but they can experience problems from time to time. The most common issues are the door not shutting properly, the delay start function malfunctioning, vibrating and making loud noises, and not starting. Fortunately, these issues can be resolved on your own with some troubleshooting. However, for more complex dishwasher repairs, it is best to contact a certified technician.
