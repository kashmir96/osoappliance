The condenser on a tumble dryer is located at the back of the appliance. It is designed to collect and condense the hot, moist air that is produced during the drying cycle. The condensed water is then drained away through a hose that runs from the condenser to a drain or outside your home.

The way in which you access the condenser will depend on your model of tumble dryer. Some models have an external access panel at the rear, while others have an internal filter that can be removed to expose the condenser. To locate your condenser you should check your user manual for instructions on how to access it.

It's important to keep your tumble dryer's condenser clean and clear of lint and other debris as this can affect its performance and efficiency. Regularly check for obstructions such as lint build up or blockages in hoses, and clean them out with a vacuum cleaner if necessary. This will help ensure that your tumble dryer runs smoothly and efficiently for years to come!
