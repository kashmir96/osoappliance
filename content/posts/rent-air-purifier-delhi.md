Air pollution in Delhi has become a major issue in the past few years. The air quality index of the city often reaches hazardous levels and the overall air quality of Delhi is extremely poor. In such a situation, renting an air purifier becomes essential to ensure safe breathing for you and your family.

An air purifier is essentially a device that cleanses the air of pollutants and particulates to make it safer for humans to breathe. It does this by using filters that trap dust, pollen, smoke, pet dander and other microscopic particles. The filters are usually made from activated carbon or HEPA which helps to capture even the smallest particulates so that they can't enter your lungs when you breathe in.

Renting an air purifier in Delhi is not only cost-effective but also convenient as it allows you to select a model according to your specific needs. There are a number of companies who offer rental services for these devices so that customers can choose one depending on their budget and requirements without having to invest in buying one outright. 

The cost of renting an air purifier depends on factors such as its size, type and capacity as well as how long you plan on using it for. Generally speaking, larger models tend to be more expensive than smaller ones but they also provide better performance due to their increased capacity which means they can cover larger areas more efficiently than smaller ones would be able to do. Additionally, some companies may also offer additional benefits such as free maintenance services or discounts if you rent multiple units at once or if you rent them over a period of time instead of just one month at a time. 

Overall, renting an air purifier provides numerous advantages when it comes to combating poor air quality in Delhi so if you want better indoor air quality then this is definitely something worth considering!
