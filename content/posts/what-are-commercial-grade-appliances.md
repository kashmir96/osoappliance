Commercial grade appliances are those that are specifically designed for high-volume usage in commercial establishments, such as restaurants and other food service businesses. These appliances are usually more powerful, durable, and efficient than standard home appliances. They are often used in areas where a large number of people will be using the same appliance on a daily basis.

The most common type of commercial grade appliance is the commercial grade oven or range. These ovens and ranges typically feature an extra-large cooking area to accommodate multiple dishes or large portions of food. They also have higher BTU ratings for faster cooking times and more consistent heat distribution throughout the oven’s interior. Some commercial grade ovens can even reach temperatures up to 500°F! 
 
Refrigerators and freezers also come in commercial grades that feature larger capacities than their residential counterparts. Commercial refrigerators may offer two or three doors with adjustable temperature settings, while freezers may include increased insulation levels to help maintain temperature consistency over time. Additionally, they often come equipped with self-cleaning features to reduce maintenance time and cost as well as advanced safety features like door locks to help prevent unauthorized access or tampering with contents while they’re stored away in the cooler/freezer unit. 

Many other types of kitchen equipment can be purchased in a commercial grade model including dishwashers, ice machines, microwaves, deep fryers, griddles and more! The benefits of choosing these models over residential versions includes improved performance capabilities due to higher wattage motors/elements as well as increased durability from stainless steel construction instead of plastic components commonly used on home models which means less frequent replacements due to wear & tear over time - saving you both money & hassle down the line! 
 
In summary – if you run a business that requires heavy duty kitchen equipment on a regular basis then investing in quality commercial grade appliances is essential for maximum efficiency & productivity (not to mention your bottom line!). While these products may cost more upfront compared to residential models they will pay off many times over by providing reliable performance & long lasting use throughout their lifetime making them well worth the investment!
