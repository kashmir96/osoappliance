If you’ve ever thrown a favorite shirt in the dryer only to find it shrunken and misshapen, you know the frustration of accidentally shrinking your clothes. Clothes shrinkage can be caused by a variety of factors, but one of the most common culprits is the dryer.

When clothes are placed in the dryer, the heat and the tumbling motion cause the fibers in the fabric to contract. This can cause clothes to shrink, especially if they are made of natural fibers like cotton and wool. Synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon are less likely to shrink in the dryer, as their fibers are less sensitive to heat.

To prevent clothes from shrinking in the dryer, it’s important to follow the care instructions on the label. If the label says to tumble dry on low or line dry, it’s best to follow those instructions. If the label says to dry clean, it’s best to take the item to a dry cleaner.

It’s also important to check the size of the clothes before putting them in the dryer. If the clothes are already a bit snug, they are more likely to shrink in the dryer. If possible, it’s best to air dry clothes that are already fitted.

Finally, it’s important to remove clothes from the dryer as soon as they are dry. Leaving clothes in the dryer for too long can cause them to shrink even more.

Shrunken clothes can be frustrating, but with a few simple steps, you can help prevent your clothes from shrinking in the dryer. By following the care instructions on the label, checking the size of the clothes before drying, and removing them from the dryer as soon as they are dry, you can help keep your clothes looking their best.
