## Buying Refurbished Washer and Dryer Sets: A Guide for Consumers 
When it comes time to buy a major appliance for your home, like a washer and dryer, there are a lot of factors to consider. Investing in a refurbished set can be a great option for cutting costs, as long as you take the appropriate steps to ensure that you make a quality purchase.

Before committing to a purchase, research the company selling the product to make sure they are reputable, and that their standards of refurbishment meet your needs. Pay attention to the details of what is included in the set, such as which parts have been replaced, and check to see if the item comes with a warranty.

It is important to do a thorough inspection of the product itself before agreeing to buy. Make sure there is no physical damage and that all the pieces seem to be working correctly. Here are some things to check: power cords, cycle selectors, water hoses, lint screens, lids and doors. If the item is digital, test the buttons and controls to make sure everything is functioning correctly.

When you have found a few good candidates for purchase, research the prices for new and used versions of the same models. This will help you determine if the cost of the set you are looking at is a good deal. Also, be sure to inquire about the delivery and removal costs of installing the item.

Finally, once you have made your decision, donâ€™t forget to ask if the company will take away your old appliances as part of the delivery. This can help save you money and eliminate disposal problems.

By taking the time to do due diligence, you can go into a purchase of a refurbished washer and dryer set with the confidence that you are making the right decision.
