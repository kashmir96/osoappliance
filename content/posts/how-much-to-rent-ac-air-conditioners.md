When it comes to renting air conditioning units, the cost varies greatly depending on the type of unit you are looking for, its size and capacity, as well as where you rent from. Generally speaking, the larger the air conditioning unit is and the higher its capacity, the more expensive it will be to rent. Additionally, if you are looking for a higher quality unit or one with specific features such as energy efficiency or noise reduction, you may have to pay more. 

For example, a small window-mounted air conditioner may cost around $30-$50 per day to rent from a rental company. On the other hand, if you are looking for an industrial-grade system with a high cooling capacity that can handle large spaces such as an auditorium or warehouse facility then it could cost up to several hundred dollars per day to rent. 

In addition to rental costs, there may be additional delivery fees and labor charges associated with renting an air conditioner. These fees vary depending on where you live and who you rent from so it's best to check with the company in advance so that there won't be any surprise charges later on. 

Overall, when it comes to renting an air conditioner unit there's no one-size-fits-all answer since costs can vary greatly based on what type of unit is needed and where it is rented from. To get an accurate estimate of how much your rental will cost make sure to do research ahead of time so that there won't be any unexpected expenses later on!
