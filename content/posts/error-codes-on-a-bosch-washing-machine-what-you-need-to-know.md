## Knowing Bosch Washing Machine Error Codes
More and more homes are being equipped with Bosch washing machines and it's essential to understand how they work and how to identify error codes if they occur. This blog post will explain what causes error codes and how to interpret the codes on your Bosch washing machine.

Error codes on Bosch washing machines are often a sign that there is a problem with the appliance. An issue may cause your Bosch washing machine to give an error code that alerts you to what is causing the issue. Many of these codes can be easily resolved, but some may require professional service.

One of the most common error codes on a Bosch washing machine is E13. This code indicates that the water level sensor is detecting too much water in the washing machine. This can be caused by a clogged drain hose, or by a blockage in the pump or drain filter. To troubleshoot, start by cleaning out any debris from the drain and pump, and then check the drain hose for any blockages. If the issue persists, you may need to contact a service technician.

The E17 error code indicates a problem with the thermal fuse. This is a safety feature that will shut off power to the appliance if it detects an excessive buildup of heat, which can be caused by a faulty heater, faulty wiring, or a buildup of lint. This problem should be investigated by a service technician.

The E24 error code indicates a problem with the drain pump on the Bosch washing machine. This can be caused by a clog in the drain line, a faulty pump, or insufficient power to the appliance. If this code appears, unplug the appliance and check the drain hose for clogs, then verify the power and circuit is off, and then check the drain pump for any blockages.

If these error codes appear on your Bosch washing machine, they may indicate a repair is needed. In some cases, there are simple solutions that can be addressed at home. But, if the error code occurs when you attempt to run a cycle, it would be a good idea to contact a service technician to diagnose the issue.

Understanding the error codes on a Bosch washing machine can help you identify any potential problems and quickly address them. If you encounter any codes that are not discussed above, you may need to consult the ownerâ€™s manual for the appliance. But if you find yourself in need of a service technician to diagnose and repair the problem, be sure to check out our Overview of Top Appliances for a list of the best local technicians in your area.
