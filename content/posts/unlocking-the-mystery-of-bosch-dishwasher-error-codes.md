## Uncovering the Secrets of Bosch Dishwasher Error Messages

Bosch dishwashers are popular household appliances offering a wide range of options and convenience. However, figuring out the cause of a Bosch dishwasher error message can be frustrating. In this post, we will discuss the basics of interpreting Bosch dishwasher error codes and provide actionable steps that can be taken to correct the issue. We will then provide a link to our comprehensive appliance error codes glossary for additional answers.

When Bosch dishwashers display an error code, the manufacturer wants the user to be able to understand what kind of problem the appliance is experiencing. The codes are usually displayed in the form of letter and numeric combinations. Some are displayed on the control panel, and some require a technician for diagnosis. By familiarizing yourself with the most common codes and what they indicate, you can take the right steps to resolve the issue.

The most common Bosch dishwasher errors are E01, E13, and E15. An E01 code indicates that the cycle is not starting, while an E13 code signals a heating problem during a cycle. An E15 code implies a full water tank. You can take the following steps to address such issues on your own:

- Unplug the machine and plug it back in.
- Check the door latch to make sure it is secure.
- Drain the water tank.
- Run the dishwasher through a cycle and make sure the cycle is completing.

Other more complex errors may signify greater issues with the dishwasher requiring the assistance of a technician. In some cases, the control panel will require a reset to perform maintenance before the dishwasher can be used.

While addressing Bosch dishwasher errors on your own can sometimes be a challenge, arming yourself with the knowledge of what the codes indicate can provide a head start in the diagnosis process.
