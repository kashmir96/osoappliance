The laundry services industry is a booming business, with an ever-growing demand for its services. The industry provides a wide array of laundry and dry cleaning services to consumers and businesses.

The laundry services industry has seen steady growth in recent years, as consumers have become more aware of the benefits of outsourcing their laundry needs. The industry is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, as more and more consumers become interested in its services.

There are a number of different types of businesses that comprise the laundry services industry. These businesses include full-service laundries, self-service laundries, dry cleaners, and coin-operated laundromats.

The full-service laundries are the largest segment of the industry, providing a wide range of laundry and dry cleaning services to consumers and businesses. These businesses typically have large facilities with a variety of machines that can handle any type of laundering or dry cleaning job. They also offer wash-and-fold service, which is becoming increasingly popular among busy working families.

The self-service laundries are a growing segment of the industry, as more and more people become interested in doing their own laundry. These businesses provide customers with access to large machines that can handle any size load. They also offer detergent and fabric softener for sale, so customers can save money on their laundry bills.

The dry cleaners segment of the industry is also growing rapidly, as more people become interested in having their clothes professionally cleaned. These businesses offer a variety of dry cleaning services, including shirt laundering, drapery cleaning, and suede/leather care. They also typically offer wash-and-fold service for those who don't have time to do their own laundry.
