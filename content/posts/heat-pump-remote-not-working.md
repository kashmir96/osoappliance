# Heat pump remote not working

If you have a heat pump system, the remote control is an important part of it. The remote can be used to change the temperature, turn the heat pump on and off, and more. Unfortunately, sometimes the remote control stops working properly. If this happens to you, here are some tips for troubleshooting your non-working heat pump remote:

First, check if there are any obstructions blocking line of sight between your heat pump and its remote receiver. If there is something in the way – like a wall or furniture – it may be preventing your signal from reaching its intended destination. Move anything that could be blocking the path so that your signal can travel freely. 

Next, take out the batteries from both devices and reinsert them securely into each component. Make sure they’re inserted properly so that power flows freely through them. 

If neither of these fixes works, factory reset both your heat pump and its remote control by pressing and holding down their respective power buttons for 8 seconds. This will restore all settings back to their original state in case any adjustments were made accidentally or maliciously. 

Finally, if all else fails you may need to replace one or both components with a new set of parts; either one could be faulty due to wear-and-tear over time or lack quality manufacturing standards when purchased initially. 
 
We hope these tips help you get your non-working heat pump remote back up and running again in no time!
