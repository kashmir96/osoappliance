## Avoid Accidentally Over Dehydrating Meat with Appliances
Using appliances like a [dehydrator](./pages/appliance-overview#dehydrators) to make snacks like jerky is a fun way to get creative in the kitchen. But did you know that if you go overboard and process meat for too long in a dehydrator, you can end up with unhealthy, inedible results? Understanding how to properly dehydrate meat is important for avoiding this dangerous mistake.

When dehydrating meat, the goal is to remove enough moisture so it’s shelf-stable and safe to eat. Meat oxidation, which is when oxygen and high temperatures break down fat molecules, can also cause the development of unhealthy compounds. Over dehydrating meat accelerates this process.

If you’ve ever tried to chew on a piece of jerky after it’s been processed for too long, you’ll notice that the texture has changed drastically. Generally, it has become dry, brittle, and difficult to even bite into. If the jerky has oxidized further, it will have taken on an acrid and unpleasant flavor.

To avoid over dehydrating and safely process meat, follow food safety guidelines and use moderations. Cook the meat until it is 165°F internally, then cure it with salt and sugar before dehydrating. Monitor the dehydrating process closely, and remove the meat when an internal temperature of 140°F has been reached.

When it comes to a healthy lifestyle, you don’t have to give up your jerky habit. Just make sure to keep an eye on your appliance and follow the dehydrations tips from this article. Keep the moisture and oxidation to a safe minimum and enjoy your snack the healthy way!
