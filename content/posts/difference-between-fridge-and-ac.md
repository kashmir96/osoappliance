When it comes to cooling appliances, two of the most popular items are refrigerators and air conditioners. While they both offer a way to keep your home cool, there are some key differences between the two.

Refrigerators use a process called refrigeration to cool their contents. This involves using a compressor that pumps refrigerant gas through coils in order to remove heat from the air inside the unit. Refrigerators usually maintain temperatures between 35째F and 40째F, making them ideal for storing food and drinks for extended periods of time without spoiling or becoming too warm. 

Air conditioners, on the other hand, use an entirely different method of cooling known as evaporative cooling. This works by passing warm air over cold evaporator coils which cools the air before being recirculated back into your home or office space. Air conditioners can also be used to regulate humidity levels in a space as well as providing additional cooling power when needed. They usually maintain temperatures between 65째F and 75째F depending on your climate control settings. 
 
The primary difference between these two types of appliances is how they operate; refrigerators use a compressor system while air conditioners rely on evaporative cooling techniques. That said, both provide excellent ways to keep your home or office comfortable and enjoyable year-round regardless of outdoor temperatures!
