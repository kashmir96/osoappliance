When it comes to buying a new washing machine, one of the most important considerations is the dimensions of your machine. In New Zealand, it’s essential to understand washing machine dimensions in order to ensure that you’re choosing the right model for your kitchen or laundry room.

The size of your washing machine will determine how much laundry you can do in one go, as well as how much space you will need to accommodate it. If you buy a washer that is too big for the space available, then you could end up with a lot of wasted space or having to make modifications to fit it in. On the other hand, if you buy a washer that is too small for your needs then you may end up having to do several loads of laundry in order to get all your clothes clean. 

Washing machines come in a variety of sizes and depths and are usually measured in centimetres (cm). The most common sizes are 60 cm, 80 cm and 100 cm wide, and between 40 cm and 85 cm deep. Generally speaking, larger machines will have higher capacity drums which can hold more clothes per load - so if you do a lot of laundry then it’s probably worth investing in a bigger appliance. 

You should also consider any additional features that could affect the size of your machine - like digital displays or water-saving technology - as these might add extra depth or width. It’s also important to check whether there are any restrictions on where you can place your washing machine due to plumbing or other factors - this might limit what size washers are suitable for your home. 

Understanding washing machine dimensions is essential when deciding on which model is right for you - both from an efficiency and practicality point-of-view. Taking into account all these factors before making a purchase will help ensure that you get the best value for money and avoid any nasty surprises down the line!

It also helps ensure it fits in your laundry space, this can be make or break when it comes to installing the machine.
