One of the most popular air conditioning systems on the market today is a split system. Split systems are composed of two main components: an outdoor unit and an indoor unit. The outdoor unit houses the compressor, condenser coil, and fan, while the indoor unit holds an evaporator coil and fan to distribute cooled air throughout your home or business.

Split systems are popular due to their energy efficiency when compared with other types of air conditioners. Many models feature SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) ratings of 16 or higher, which means they use less energy than traditional cooling systems while still providing superior cooling performance. Additionally, split systems are relatively quiet due to their design that keeps noise-producing components outside.

Another reason why split systems are so popular is because they can be installed in places where traditional air conditioners cannot fit due to space restrictions. The indoor and outdoor units can be placed in different areas, allowing for much more flexibility in installation than other types of ACs. This makes them ideal for homes with limited space or multi-level buildings that require separate cooling zones on each floor.

In addition to being energy efficient and easy to install, split system ACs also come with a variety of features that make them even more attractive for homeowners looking for a reliable cooling solution. Many models include advanced filters that help remove allergens from the air as well as programmable thermostats that allow you to adjust temperatures according to your daily schedule or preferences. Some even offer Wi-Fi connectivity so you can control them remotely from anywhere with an internet connection!

Split system air conditioners provide superior comfort and convenience while also helping save energy costs over timeâ€”making them one of the most popular choices on the market today!
