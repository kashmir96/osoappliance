## Unlocking the Mystery of Whirlpool Washer Error Codes

Having a washing machine in your home is a major convenience that often gets taken for granted. That comfort can quickly devolve into frustration when a Whirlpool washer error code appears on your LCD display.

Your first thought could be to call a repair service, but with a few simple steps, it's possible to identify the code yourself and resolve the issue quickly and easily.

To decode a Whirlpool washer's error code, you'll need to look it up in the manufacturer’s troubleshooting manual or information provided by the retailer where you purchased the product. Many codes appear as a "F" with a number after it, such as F70, F71 or F72. 

Punctuation marks, such as a "long-dash" or "double-dash," may precede the code, and will be followed by other details. 

These codes indicate a specific issue with the washer, such as a power supply problem or a failed temperature sensor. The information in the manual can tell you which problem you’re having and provide instructions on how to repair or reset it.

Once you know what the code means and have followed the instructions to resolve it, you should be able to reset your washer and get back to regular laundry operation.
