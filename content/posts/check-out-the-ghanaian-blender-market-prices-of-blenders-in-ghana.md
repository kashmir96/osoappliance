This is great news for general consumers and users of household appliances! Read on to learn more about the market for blenders in Ghana and what you can expect to pay. 

The current market for blenders in Ghana includes a mix of options from both local and foreign manufacturers. Prices vary depending on the features available on the model, such as its motor power, number of speeds, and type of container. For basic blenders, generally those made by local manufacturers, the average cost is around GHS 15; however, an electric blender with the latest features could range anywhere between GHS 90 and GHS 167.

When considering an electric blender, it’s important to factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs. While routine maintenance is recommended for all blenders, it is especially important for electric blenders given the complexity of their components.
