With the right help, you can find a reliable repair person with the tools and know-how to get your dryer back up and running in no time. 

Finding a qualified repair technician who's near you should be your first priority. Local technicians not only have the best understanding of the local conditions, but they might have the right parts in stock and can come to you quickly if needed. Local companies also often offer more competitive rates than big chains and can provide personalized, one-on-one service.

An experienced technician should be able to provide an estimate over the phone. 

When you’re ready to hire someone, make sure you’re protected by signing a contract that outlines all the details of the job. This should include the cost, warranty and services included in the fee. 

By finding the right repair person, you’ll save a lot of time and frustration that comes from DIY repairs or waiting for a big chain to get around to you.
