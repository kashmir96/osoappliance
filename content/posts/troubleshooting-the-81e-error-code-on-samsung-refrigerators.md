## Troubleshooting Samsung Refrigerator Error 81e 

It’s not uncommon for a Samsung refrigerator to encounter error codes. But when you do happen to see the 81e error code, it can be confusing to know how to address it. In this post, we’ll offer some useful tips on how to troubleshoot the 81e error code on Samsung refrigerators. 

The 81e error code is a fan error that’s associated with the evaporator fan. This fan is used to circulate air around the fresh food and freezer compartments, helping to keep them at the ideal temperature. If this evaporator fan isn’t working due to a bad motor, the refrigerator’s control board will detect the lack of airflow and will flash the 81e error code on the digital display. 

If you’re experiencing the 81e errors code, the first thing to do is to empty the refrigerator. This will allow easy access to the evaporator fan and also ensure your food doesn’t get spoiled during the repair. Then remove the back wall of the freezer and locate the fan motor, unplug the refrigerator, and remove the fan motor before testing it for continuity. If it doesn’t pass the continuity test, then this likely indicates the fan motor has gone bad and will need to be replaced. 

It’s important to note that the 81e error code could also be caused by defective sensors or the refrigerator’s control board, not just the evaporator fan motor. If a repair person can’t determine the root cause by inspecting the fan motor, it will be necessary to perform further tests and replacement of other components. 

It’s always advisable to contact a professional technician to troubleshoot and repair any refrigerator error code.
