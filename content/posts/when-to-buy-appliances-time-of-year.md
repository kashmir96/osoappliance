When it comes to buying appliances, timing is everything. Knowing when to buy can save you hundreds of dollars in the long run. Here are a few tips for getting the best deal on appliances throughout the year. 

January and February: This is one of the best times to buy large home appliances as retailers start offering discounts for end-of-season sales and big-box stores start rolling out their Black Friday deals early. Look for major savings on refrigerators, stoves, washers, dryers and dishwashers.

May through August: The summer months are ideal for finding great deals on small kitchen appliances like mixers, blenders and coffee makers as retailers make room for holiday inventory. This is also a great time to find discounts on air conditioners as they go out of season. 

September through November: As new models start hitting shelves in September, retailers are eager to unload last yearâ€™s stock so they can make room in their warehouses and showrooms. Look for deep discounts on TVs, computers and other electronics during this time period -- especially around Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving). 

December: As expected, December is an excellent time to purchase gifts like laptops or tablets -- but try not to wait until Christmas Eve if you want any hope of finding a good deal! Many stores offer special holiday sales throughout December that can save you big bucks if you shop early enough!
