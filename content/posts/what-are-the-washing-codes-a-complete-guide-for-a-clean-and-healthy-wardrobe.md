## A Guide to Washing Codes for Cleaner Clothes and a Healthier Wardrobe
Do the many washing codes on different labels of clothing have you perplexed? Many clothing tags have symbols with numbers, lines and circles which can seem overwhelming to decode. Understanding these codes can potentially save you time, money, and a ruined wardrobe. Read on to find out what these washing symbols mean and how to abide by them.

Washing codes are numerals or symbols found on the tag, usually located near the neck or bottom hemline of the garment. These symbols represent the recommended laundering instructions from the manufacturer. Following these instructions is important for keeping the fabric, color and shape of the clothing in good condition.

The most common codes are for Wash (W), Bleach (B), Dry (D) and Iron (I). Washers, dryers, and ironers will often have corresponding symbols indicating your safesettings on that particular fabric. 

â€‹For example, a single bar on the Wash symbol means delicate cycle or 30 degrees, while two bars indicate a warm machine wash or 40 degrees. Additionally, a line underneath the symbol means machine wash only, while a circle around it means the fabric can be machine washed or dry cleaned.

Other symbols represent dry cleaning, special care, tumble drying, and ironing. A wash tub with lines indicates the number of times the fabric should be washed, for instance, two short lines in the tub advise that the article is 'washable' or can be washed two or three times. A triangle indicates that the fabric must be dry cleaned, whereas a hand in a bucket showing the index finger means 'hand wash only'. 

When laundering clothing, take care to use the appropriate settings. Hot water or too much detergent can cause irreversible damage to the garment . Keeping in mind these simple but essential tips is all it takes to keep your wardrobe looking its very best. 

Knowing the abbreviations and what they represent is the first step to laundering your clothes and household linens properly.
