If your dishwasher isn't cleaning properly, it can be a source of frustration. After all, the purpose of a dishwasher is to make cleaning dishes easier, not harder. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the problem.

First, start by inspecting the dishwasher for any blockages or clogs. Check for any items that may be blocking the spray arms or the filter. If you find something, remove it and run the dishwasher again.

Next, check the detergent dispenser. Make sure it is filled with the correct amount of detergent and that the dispenser is functioning properly. If it is not, try cleaning it out with a toothbrush and some white vinegar.

If the dishwasher is still not cleaning properly, you may need to check the water temperature. The water should be hot enough to dissolve the detergent, so if it is too cold, the dishes won't get clean. To check the water temperature, use an infrared thermometer to measure the water at the dishwasher's inlet. The ideal temperature should be between 120 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

Finally, if the dishwasher is still not cleaning properly, you may need to replace the spray arms. Over time, the spray arms can become clogged or worn out, preventing them from spinning and spraying water effectively. If this is the case, you can purchase new spray arms from a local appliance store.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the problem with your dishwasher. If you are still having trouble, it may be time to call a professional for help.
