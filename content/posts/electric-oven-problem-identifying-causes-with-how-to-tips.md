## Troubleshooting Electric Oven Problems
It can be incredibly frustrating to have an electric oven that is suddenly not cooperating. Whether it won't heat up or you can't turn it on at all, it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. This blog will cover some of the most common electric oven problems and how-to tips for identifying and possible resolving them. 

One of the most common electric oven issues is heating issues. This can manifest in several ways, from overheating to not heating at all. When the oven either doesn't heat up or reaches the wrong temperature, the possible causes are varied. The heating and igniter elements may need to be replaced, or a thermostat or circuit breaker needs adjustment or replacement. Even gas ovens can experience electrical problems, too. 

The next most common issue is failure to turn on. A cause of this issue could be as simple as a blown fuse, so checking the fuse box is always a good place to start. Oftentimes, if a fuse has been tripped, the oven will not turn on and the display will remain blank. Simply replacing the fuse should fix this issue. If you're not sure what type of fuse is in your oven, consulting the manufacturer's user manual or checking the oven's rating plate should reveal the type needed. 

In some cases, ovens may not power on due to a faulty door switch or latch. To check for issues with the latch, open and close the oven door a few times. If the oven does not turn on, you may need to replace the oven door latch assembly. 

In some cases, the mechanical timer may not be working properly, or the oven may not respond to commands on the buttons. In that case, it's a good idea to have a professional technician come out and inspect the oven. In many cases, new parts will need to be installed to get the oven functioning properly.
