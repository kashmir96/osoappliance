Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular in homes and businesses as a way to reduce dust and other airborne particles. These devices use various technologies to capture and filter out these particles, such as activated carbon filters, HEPA filters, and ionizers.

The most common type of air purifier is the activated carbon filter. These are typically composed of a thick layer of carbon that is highly porous. As air passes through the filter, it traps tiny particles such as smoke, dust, pet dander, mold spores, pollen and other allergens on its surface. This helps to reduce their presence in the air by removing them from circulation altogether.

HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters are also popular for their ability to trap very small particles – those smaller than 0.3 microns in size – from circulating in the air. They work similarly to activated carbon filters but can be more effective since they can capture even tinier particles than those caught by an activated carbon filter alone.

Ionizers are another type of air purifier that uses electrical charges to attract dust and other pollutants towards a collector plate or plate-like structure where the particles accumulate until they can be removed manually or automatically through an exhaust system set up with the device. Ionizers disperse negative ions into the room which cling onto positively charged airborne particles like dust or smoke before they’re pulled out of circulation by being attracted towards the collector plate or plates inside the device itself. 

No matter which type you choose for your home or office setting, these devices all work together to reduce levels of airborne pollutants like dust within an indoor environment for improved comfort levels for residents or workers alike who may be sensitive to triggers associated with these types of particles like sneezing fits or asthma attacks due to allergies caused by them present in larger quantities than normal in one’s environment.
