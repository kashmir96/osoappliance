In the summer months, one of the best ways to beat the heat is to turn on the air conditioning. But while cool air can make us feel more comfortable during hot weather, it may also have health effects.

When air conditioning is used in a building with poor ventilation, it can lead to a build-up of pollutants in the air. These pollutants can irritate respiratory conditions such as asthma or cause sore throats and headaches.

The dryness that often comes with air-conditioning can also be troublesome for some people. Dryness of the skin and eyes can cause irritation and discomfort, while dryness of mucous membranes such as those in our nose and throat can increase susceptibility to viruses and bacterial infections. To reduce these effects, you should consider adding a humidifier in your home or office environment when running an AC system. 

Another health effect caused by cold air conditioning is hypothermia – a condition where body temperature drops below normal levels due to prolonged exposure to cooler temperatures. Symptoms include shivering, confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech; if left untreated it could result in serious health issues such as coma or death. People who are more sensitive to colder temperatures – like elderly people, small children or those with underlying medical conditions – should pay extra attention when spending extended periods of time in an environment with cold air conditioning systems running at full blast. 

Finally, some studies suggest that staying indoors with constant exposure to artificial lighting may disrupt natural circadian rhythms (body clocks). This could lead to difficulty sleeping or fatigue during the day due to lack of natural light exposure which is essential for maintaining healthy sleep patterns. 

 All these effects are important factors that need consideration before using any kind of AC system indoors without proper ventilation or humidifiers. Although cold AC systems provide much needed relief from hot summer days, they may come at a cost for some people’s health if not used properly so always consult your doctor before using any form of cooling system indoors!
