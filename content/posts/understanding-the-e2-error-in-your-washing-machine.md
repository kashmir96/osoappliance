## Understanding the E2 Error on Your Washing Machine
Have you ever noticed an error code flashing on the display of your washing machine? These error codes are useful indicators that something is wrong with your appliance and needs to be investigated. One common code is the E2 error, which is associated with draining issues in the washing machine.

In most washing machines, the E2 code signals that either a component in the draining system is blocked or failing, or that the drain pump has failed. If the drum of the machine does not spin, a broken belt or failed bearing could be the cause. However, these problems need to be investigated by a qualified technician to ensure it is fixed properly.

Other causes of the E2 error include a faulty pressure switch, a clogged water pump filter, blocked door seal, a broken wiring connection, or a faulty control board. While it is possible for do-it-yourselfers to check for some of the problems, many of these require professional help.

If left unresolved, the E2 error code will cause water to build up in the inner drum, which can cause extensive damage if ignored. While many of the components will not require a full replacement, they will need to be assessed and possibly affected if the issue is not addressed in a timely manner.

In addition to the E2 error code, understanding other appliance error codes can also help you stay informed on the status of your washing machine. Our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) contains a list of the most common problems associated with washing machines and the corresponding codes. Knowing what to look for and how to address the underlying problems can be invaluable when servicing your appliance.
