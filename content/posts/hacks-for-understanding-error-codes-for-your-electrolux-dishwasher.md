## Unlocking the Secrets of Your Electrolux Dishwasher Error Codes

Having an error code show up on your Electrolux dishwasher can be a perplexing, and often daunting thing. How in the world are you supposed to understand an error code that you don’t recognize? The good news is that dishwasher error codes don’t hide the solution to their problems in most cases.

In order to begin hacking into the codes, a clear understanding of the symbols used to denote the codes is beneficial. Electrolux dishwashers tend to feature a single panel of blinking lights displaying the code, as well as occasionally a digital display. Knowing some common symbols can go a long way in deciphering the codes. Your washer likely uses arrows flashing in coordinated patterns, a water droplet and tap symbol, or the number 8 flashing, all indication of some kind of issue.

Once you’ve identified the code, consulting the owner’s manual can help you determine the course of action that needs to take place. Doing an internet search of the code can bring up many helpful sources as well, as there are several appliance repair forums and other knowledge base sites out there that have explanations of the codes and what to do.

If the repair does require a certain part, knowing the make and model number of your dishwasher can be immensely helpful for finding the correct part. Repairing the problem does not necessarily require help from an appliance repair technician if the source of the problem is described clearly.

In some cases, however, the error code means that you will need to call upon the help of a professional appliance repair technician. If it’s time to call in a repair professional, let our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) help save you time searching for the right service.

You don’t need to be an appliance technician to read an Electrolux dishwasher error code. With a basic understanding of the code symbols, as well as a little help from the internet and owner’s manual, you can narrow down the issue and determine whether or not it needs the help of a repair specialist. So get out there and start deciphering those error codes!
