Gör rent blender is a Swedish phrase that literally means "Do clean blender". It is used as a metaphor for taking the time to make sure that all of the pieces of a task are properly put in place before beginning something new. This could be likened to making sure that all of the ingredients are in the right place and proportion before starting to make a recipe. 

Gör rent blender can also refer to cleaning up any messes or loose ends from previous tasks before starting something new. This could mean organizing files on your computer, clearing out old emails, or filing away documents appropriately. Taking the time to do this will help ensure that when you begin something new, you have all of your resources in order and nothing gets overlooked or forgotten. 

Finally, gör rent blender is also used as an expression for taking stock of yourself mentally and emotionally. This means checking in with yourself periodically throughout the day and making sure that you’re feeling focused and motivated before beginning something new. This can be done through meditation, journaling, or simply reflecting on how you’re feeling at any given moment. 

Overall, gör rent blender is an important concept for anyone who wants to stay organized and productive throughout their day! Taking the time to do this will help ensure that everything runs smoothly when starting anew and ultimately lead to greater success!
