If your oven door won’t close, it can be a frustrating experience. There are several possible causes for this issue and understanding what the underlying issue is can help you get your oven back in working order.

One of the most common reasons why an oven door won’t close is because the hinges are out of alignment. Oven doors will often become misaligned due to regular use over time or if they have been bumped or jostled. To fix this problem, you may need to adjust the hinges with a screwdriver and realign them so that the door closes properly.

Another possible cause of an oven door not closing is that it has become warped from extreme temperatures. This can happen if the oven has been exposed to high temperatures for extended periods of time or if it has been used to cook food that requires extreme heat. To fix this issue, you may need to replace the door with a new one that is designed for your model of oven.

Finally, if your oven door won’t close because it is stuck in place, then there may be something blocking it from closing properly. This could be anything from a piece of food that has become lodged in the track of the door or a piece of debris that has gotten stuck in the hinges. In these cases, you may need to remove whatever is blocking the door before it will close properly again.

No matter what the cause of your oven door not closing properly, understanding why it isn’t closing can help you take action to fix it and get your oven back in working order as soon as possible.
