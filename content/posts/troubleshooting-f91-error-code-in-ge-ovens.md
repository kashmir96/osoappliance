## Diagnosing and Resolving the F91 Error Code in GE Ovens

Are you having issues with your GE oven? An F91 Error code could be the cause of your problems. This is an issue with the oven's temperature sensor, which detects the temperature inside the oven. Ovens with this error code may exhibit a variety of symptoms, including failure to heat, overheating, or incorrect temperature readings. Read on to learn more about the F91 Error code and how to troubleshoot it.

The F91 Error code is caused by a faulty temperature sensor. The sensor monitors the oven's internal temperature, and when the sensor fails, all sorts of problems can occur. If the temperature sensor is malfunctioning, it can cause the oven to overheat, read incorrect temperatures, or fail to heat at all.

If your oven is displaying the F91 Error code, the first step is to check your oven's power supply. Ensure the power cord is plugged in and that the outlet is operational. If the outlet is operational and the power cord is securely plugged in, try resetting the oven by unplugging it and plugging it back in.

If that doesn't work, you may have to replace the oven's temperature sensor. To do this, unplug the oven and then locate the sensor. It's usually located near the back wall of the oven. Unscrew the screws from the temperature sensor and remove the sensor from the oven. Then, replace it with a new one. 

It's important to note that the F91 Error code can be indicative of a deeper issue. If the problem persists after replacing the temperature sensor, you may need to call in a professional for further assistance.

Troubleshooting the F91 Error code on a GE oven is an involved process that requires patience and precision. With an understanding of the issue and the right tools, you can diagnose and resolve the problem quickly and confidently.
