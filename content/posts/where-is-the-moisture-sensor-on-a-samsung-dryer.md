If you own a Samsung dryer, you may be wondering where the moisture sensor is located. The moisture sensor on a Samsung dryer is located inside the drum of the dryer, beneath the lint filter. The moisture sensor is used to detect when your clothes are dry and stop the cycle before they become over-dried. 

The purpose of the moisture sensor is to prevent over-drying your clothes. Over-drying can damage or shrink fabrics, resulting in costly repairs or replacement costs. The moisture sensor works by measuring how much water vapor is present in your laundry load and then stopping the cycle when it detects that there is no more water vapor left to be removed from your clothes. 

To locate the exact position of your Samsung dryer's moisture sensor, refer to your ownerâ€™s manual or contact Samsung customer service for assistance. Additionally, you can also perform a visual inspection by removing the lint filter and looking inside the drum for a small metal device with two metal probes that protrude outwards into the drum space. This metal device is your Samsung dryer's moisture sensor. 

It's important to note that if you ever need to replace or repair this part, it should only be done by a qualified technician as improper installation or calibration could lead to inaccurate readings from the device and poor performance from your machine. Additionally, regular cleaning of this part is highly recommended as dust and lint build up can prevent it from working correctly over time. 

By understanding where your Samsung dryer's moisture sensor is located, you will have more control over how well your laundry cycles are performing and help extend its life expectancy.
