## Solving the TE1 Error Code on Your LG Dryer
Whether you’re accustomed to doing laundry yourself or you’ve just moved into a new home and are in the process of learning how to use your home appliances, experiencing error codes on your LG dryer can be stressful. Thankfully, the TE1 error code is one of the more common LG dryer error codes and it’s fairly easy to troubleshoot. Read on to learn how to handle any issues that come up with the TE1 error code. 

First off, it’s important to understand what the TE1 code is trying to indicate. The TE1 error code on an LG dryer means that there is an issue with the thermistor, a part of the dryer that helps monitor the temperature level in the dryer’s drum. In short, this error code indicates that you’re likely dealing with a problem related to low or high temperatures. 

The first troubleshooting step you’ll want to take is to check the thermal fuse and make sure it’s properly connected. The thermal fuse is a safety feature that kicks in when temperatures inside the dryer get dangerously high—if it’s not connected properly or if it has blown, the dryer won’t heat up anymore. 

However, if the thermal fuse isn’t the issue, the problem is likely related to the resistance of the thermistor, the part of the dryer that helps to regulate temperature. Disconnect the dryer from the power source, then remove the dryer’s top panel and locate the thermistor. Take a multimeter and check the thermistor’s resistance to ensure that it’s within the resistance range recommended by the manufacturer. 

If the thermistor’s resistance is outside of the range recommended by the manufacturer, then you’ll need to replace it entirely. To do this, you can order a replacement part online and install the new one yourself.
