When it comes to purchasing second-hand appliances, Christchurch has plenty of options for those looking to save a little money. From charity shops to outlets specialising in second-hand goods, and from car boot sales to classified ad sites, there's sure to be a second-hand bargain to be had.

Before you invest your money in a second-hand appliance, there are a few things to think about. It's always a good idea to inspect any appliance you decide to buy, to check that all switches and buttons work, the appliance is clean, and especially to check any power leads or wires for signs of heat damage. When purchasing online, ask to see pictures and full descriptions of items before you buy.

The most important thing to remember is that your safety shouldn't be compromised when buying second-hand appliances. If a piece of any appliance has been removed or replacements made, an electrician or appliance technician should be consulted to make sure the item is safe.
