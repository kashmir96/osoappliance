As we look ahead to the new year of 2023, one of the most exciting kitchen appliances to consider is a brand-new toaster. Toasters have come a long way since their invention in 1893, and today’s models offer far more than just perfectly toasted bread slices. The best toasters for 2023 are those that not only toast evenly, but also offer a range of features and settings that make it easy for you to get your toast just how you like it.

When shopping for a new toaster, it’s important to consider your needs and preferences. If you like getting creative with your toast, then look for a model with extra-wide slots that can accommodate bagels, English muffins, and other types of bread. Additionally, look for models with variable browning control so you can get your toast as light or dark as you want. Some even come with separate slots on either side of the machine so you can make two different types of toast at once! 

If convenience is key when making breakfast in the morning then opt for a model that comes with special features such as defrosting or reheating capabilities. This will allow you to quickly pop frozen waffles into the slot and have them ready in no time flat! Models with LCD displays help ensure accuracy by allowing you set the exact temperature according to what type of bread or pastry it is that you’re cooking up. 

Finally, opt for models made from stainless steel or ceramic coated metal surfaces as these materials won’t rust over time and tend not too yellow from heat exposure over time like plastic does. This also helps keep food particles from sticking during cleaning which makes maintenance easier down the road! 

The best thing about modern-day technology is its ability to give us plenty of options when it comes to devices such as microwaves and blenders–the same goes for our beloved kitchen staple: The Toaster! Whether making classic slices of wheat bread or something more gourmet such as croissants stuffed with cream cheese; there’s sure be one out there that fits your needs perfectly so shop wisely this upcoming year!
