## Dealing With an F34 Error on a GE Oven
Are you the owner of a GE oven? Do you see an F34 error code on the display? Don’t panic - we have the answers you need to help you fix the issue and get your oven back up and running. 

The F34 error code indicates a problem with the oven’s electronic oven control. It’s a code that lets you know there’s a component malfunction. The component that’s malfunctioning is the temperature sensor probe and it needs to be replaced. To replace this component you'll need to locate the electronic oven control board, which is typically behind a cover at the lower back of the oven. To gain access to this component, turn off the power to the oven and unscrew the cover to the oven control board. 

The temperature sensor probe is typically in the neighborhood of the control board. With power turned off to the oven, disconnect the probe from the oven wiring and unscrew it from the oven wall. Install a new probe and connect it to the wiring harness. Secure it in the oven and screw the oven control board cover back on. Turn the oven's power back on to test the repair.

Although the F34 error code isn't one of the more common ones that you can encounter while using your GE oven, it is still repairable. With the right steps and the proper guidance, you can get your oven working just like new again. If you're uncomfortable making the repairs yourself, you may want to consider hiring a professional from our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). 

Good luck and happy baking!
