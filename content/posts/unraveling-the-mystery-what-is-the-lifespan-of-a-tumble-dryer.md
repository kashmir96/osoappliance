## Uncovering the Lifespan of a Tumble Dryer
Tumble dryers are an indispensable home appliance for many households. They are invaluable for not only keeping our laundry dry after a wash but for reducing the use of power-hungry clotheslines. But, how long do tumble dryers last? 

On average, in a home environment, you can expect your tumble dryer to last around 10 years. Although this may seem short in comparison to other household appliances, the lifetime of a tumble dryer is largely dependent on the type and frequency of use it receives.

The more a tumble dryer is used, the greater the impact wear and tear from spinning, heating, and drying clothing will have on its longevity. If a tumble dryer is used every day, it will reduce the average lifespan. Similarly, if the tumble dryer is being used to constantly dry heavyweight lumps of wet clothing all at once, this will also shorten its lifespan. 

In terms of maintenance, it is important to keep the vents and filter of your tumble dryer free of lint and debris to ensure it is functioning properly. Regular cleaning can also help to increase the lifespan of your tumble dryer.

When it comes time to retire your tumble dryer and get a new one, identify the source of the malfunctioning and refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for help in troubleshooting. Having this information can help ensure efficient and cost-effective repair services and prevent future malfunctions. 

To prevent tumble dryer malfunctions for next time, remember the average lifespan of a tumble dryer is around 10 years in a home environment and is dependent on the type and frequency of use it receives. Regular and thorough maintenance of your tumble dryer, such as keeping vents and filters clean, can help to prolong its longevity.
