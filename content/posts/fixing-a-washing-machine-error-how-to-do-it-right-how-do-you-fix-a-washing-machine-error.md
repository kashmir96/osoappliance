## Troubleshooting Washing Machine Errors

If your washing machine isn't working correctly, you'll need to determine the source of the error so you can repair it correctly. Understanding how to troubleshoot and fix a washing machine error can help you save time and money and get your laundry done quickly.

The first step to fixing a washing machine error is to find the source of the problem. There are several ways to do this. First, check the control panel display for error codes or messages. If you are unable to identify the code and message, refer to the manufacturer's instructions or a comprehensive appliance error codes glossary.

Once you have identified the code, you may be able to fix the problem yourself. Many errors, such as an unbalanced load, are easily fixed with some simple steps. Check the load size and balance it in the drum by spreading out the load. If the load is too small, add more clothes. If it is too large, reduce the number of items in the load.

If the error code is more complicated, such as an electrical problem, it is generally recommended to call a professional for help. Professional service providers will be able to diagnose the issue quickly and may even be able to come out the same day. If possible, try to provide the service technician with the model, manufacturer and serial numbers of your washer.

You don't want to spend unnecessary time and money on repairs, so understanding how to troubleshoot and fix a washing machine error is important. Refer to error codes or your manual for specific instructions and if needed, call a professional for help. Once the issue is resolved, you can be back to doing laundry in no time.
