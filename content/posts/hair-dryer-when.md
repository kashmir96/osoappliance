Hair dryers are a staple hair styling tool for many people, but knowing when to use them is just as important as knowing how. While it’s tempting to reach for the hair dryer after every shower, overuse can cause damage to your hair.

If you’re using a blow dryer, it’s best to start with damp rather than wet hair. This will help reduce the amount of time you need to spend drying your hair and limit the amount of heat damage. When drying your hair, use a low heat setting and keep the dryer moving around so that one area isn’t exposed to too much heat.

For those with curly or wavy hair, air drying is usually the best option. This will help reduce frizz and preserve your natural curl pattern. If you do need to use a blow dryer on curly or wavy hair, make sure you use a diffuser attachment so that the air is distributed more evenly and doesn’t disrupt the curl pattern.

Hair dryers are also great for adding volume and texture to straight or fine hair. Use a round brush while blow drying for added lift at the roots and extra body throughout the length of your hair. You can also use a small barrel curling iron after blow drying for extra volume and texture if desired.

Overall, it’s important to remember that using a blow dryer too often can lead to heat damage and split ends. Be sure to take breaks between uses and always use a heat protectant before styling with hot tools!
