If you’re looking for a way to preserve fruits, vegetables and more in the form of delicious snacks, Nesco dehydrators offer a great option. But did you know that there are a few key accessories that can make your dehydrating experience even better?

The Nesco Clean-A-Screen is one of the first and most important pieces of equipment you should consider when using your dehydrator. This screen fits perfectly into all Nesco models and prevents small particles from getting into the food being dried, keeping it hygienic and free from bacteria or mold. The Clean-A-Screen also helps reduce moisture loss during the drying process and allows air to circulate more evenly, leaving you with tastier results. 

Another essential item is the Fruit Roll Sheet, which helps prevent fruits or vegetables from sticking to your trays while they’re drying. You can also use this sheet to make fruit leathers by pouring your favorite pureed fruit onto it before drying. 

Last but not least, you should add an adjustable thermostat to your list of accessories if you want precise control over the temperature for whatever food you’re drying. This device will automatically adjust fan speed as needed to keep temperatures at an optimal level for perfect results every time. 

These are just a few of the many accessories available for Nesco dehydrators that can help improve your food preservation experience significantly! With these simple additions, there’s no reason why anyone shouldn’t be able to enjoy delicious dried snacks whenever they'd like!
