## Refrigerator Compressor Lifespans Explained
A refrigerator relies on the compressor to keep food cool. This small but important appliance is essential for ensuring food stays fresh, so understanding its lifespan is essential for any owner (or potential owner) of a refrigerator. Keep reading to learn what to expect when it comes to the lifespan of your fridge's compressor. 

The average refrigerator compressor can last 10 to 15 years or more. This is dependent on the frequency of use and how often the temperature is altered, as well as the make and model of your refrigerator, but it is a reasonable expectation that it will hold up for a decade or more. Of course, this could be shorter if you open and close the door a lot or often change the temperature. It's important to bear in mind that if your compressor dies before 10-15 years, you may be able to claim for repairs or replacements with the manufacturer (if your refrigerator is still within the warranty period). 

The amount of care and attention you pay to your refrigerator can also influence its lifespan. Cleaning regularly, ensuring the gaskets are not broken or damaged, and wiping off any ice buildup can all increase the longevity of the refrigerator and its compressor. In addition, replacing the air filter regularly can help in this regard. Regular servicing and maintenance will also be beneficial in terms of keeping your refrigerator in good working order, reducing the likelihood of your compressor failing before its expected lifetime. 

All household appliances require some level of maintenance and care; this is true for refrigerator compressors, too. Understanding the expected lifespan of your compressor and taking the necessary steps to maintain it can help keep it in good condition for as long as possible.
