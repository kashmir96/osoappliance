## Pro and Con of Leaving the Washing Machine Door Open

The debate about whether to leave your washing machine door open between uses is a common one. In short, some feel that leaving it open can help prevent musty odors from growing, while others say potentially leaving it open increases the chances of items falling in and blocking the outlet. Let's take a look at both sides and make a determination.

Opening the washing machine door between washes helps reduce odor and mildew caused by water vapor. This is due to the increased ventilation and the ability of the washer to dry more quickly. Keeping the washer’s interior dry between uses is key to preventing bad odors and mold. Also, when detergent is constantly on the washer’s door seals, it can lead to an unpleasant smell over time.

On the other hand, when the washing machine door is open, it also means that any other items near it can fall in. This can potentially become a problem if the item finds itself blocking the drain or agitator, preventing the washer from properly spinning or draining. This can quickly lead to damaged clothing and a big mess in your laundry room.

The decision is ultimately up to the individual as to whether or not to leave the washing machine door open between uses. If desired, and space permitting, leaving it open will provide the most benefit, eliminating odors and mold build up. However, you must be sure that items can't fall into the washer, potentially causing a serious problem.
