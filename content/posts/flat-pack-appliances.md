Flat pack appliances are becoming increasingly popular in today's market as a way to save space and money. Flat pack appliances are packaged in parts and require assembly upon delivery. They typically cost less than their regular counterparts, but they do require some effort to assemble.

Flat pack appliances are popular because they can be delivered to homes where regular appliances cannot fit due to the size or weight of the product. They can also be more affordable than traditional models, making them attractive for those on a budget. Additionally, flat packed items tend to have fewer components, which make them easier to move around and store away when not in use.

One major downside of flat pack appliances is that it can take some time and effort to assemble them properly. It is important for consumers to read all instructions carefully before attempting the assembly process, as incorrect assembly may lead to damage or malfunctioning of the appliance. Additionally, it may be difficult for some people with limited home improvement skills or tools needed for the job. 

In order to ensure that your flat packed appliance is built correctly and safely, it's best practice that you either follow all instructions precisely or consider hiring a professional contractor with experience assembling such items if possible. Doing so will help you avoid any potential damage or malfunctioning of your new product as well as ensuring that you get the most out of your purchase.
