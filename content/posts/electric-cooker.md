An electric cooker is a kitchen appliance that uses electricity to heat up food. It is a convenient and efficient way to prepare meals without having to use a stove or an oven. Electric cookers come in various shapes and sizes, but they all operate on the same principle: heating elements located beneath the cooking surface heat up food quickly and evenly by transferring energy from electricity directly into the food.

Electric cookers are versatile appliances that can be used for a variety of cooking tasks including boiling, steaming, frying, baking, roasting and grilling. They are typically divided into two categories: standard electric cookers which have just one heating element under the cooking surface; and combination (or multi-function) electric cookers which have several separate heating elements and controls to provide different types of cooking options.

Standard electric cookers are ideal for simple dishes such as rice, pasta or potatoes as well as stews or soups that require longer-cooking times. The temperature of these single-element models is usually controlled with either an on/off switch or a dial setting so you can adjust the heat level accordingly. Combination models allow you to switch between different functions such as grill and oven mode depending on what type of dish you’re preparing – making them great for more complex recipes like lasagne or roast dinners.

Electric cookers are also energy efficient; they use less energy than both gas and conventional ovens while still providing good results. And unlike gas stoves, they don’t require open flames so they’re much safer to use in homes with young children around – plus they won’t create any fumes inside your kitchen! 

Overall, electric cookers are reliable appliances that make it easy to create delicious meals quickly and safely. Whether you’re looking for something simple for everyday use or more advanced features such as grill mode for gourmet dishes – there’s definitely an electric cooker out there that will suit your needs!
