## Understanding 8e Error Code and Troubleshooting Process in Samsung Washers

For many homeowners, owning a washer and dryer has become a daily necessity. And while high-quality appliances such as those made by Samsung offer convenience and efficiency, there are times when an issue can occur. A common issue is the 8e error code on Samsung washers, which can be both frustrating and confusing.

The 8e error code on Samsung washers indicates the machine is unable to drain properly. This code means the drain pump inside the washer has failed and can't spin properly, or that the hose leading from the washer to the drain is clogged. To troubleshoot these issues, the first step is to unplug the washer from its power source and check the drain hose for blockages. If the hose is clear and there are no visible blockages, the user can then clear the error code by pressing the ‘pause’ and ‘start’ buttons for three seconds. 

In some cases, the 8e error code may indicate an issue within the washer’s motor, pump, or original installation. If the code is still present after checking the hose and pressing the appropriate buttons, users should contact Samsung’s authorized service center or a professional appliance repairman. Using a multimeter can also help to identify specific issues within the wiring and connections of the washer.

Whether someone is troubleshooting the 8e error code or another issue with their Samsung washer, it is important to know the details of the issue and the process to resolve it.
