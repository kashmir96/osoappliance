A range hood is a kitchen appliance that removes heat, steam, smoke, grease, and odors from the air in your kitchen. It’s important for proper ventilation in your home and for good air quality. 

So how long should a range hood last? Generally, range hoods can last anywhere from 10 to 15 years with proper maintenance. However, the lifespan of a range hood depends on several factors such as type of material used, frequency of use and cleaning habits. 

Stainless steel range hoods are the most durable and long-lasting option available. They can easily outlast other materials such as plastic or wood. They also require less maintenance over time because they are resistant to rusting and corrosion. Additionally, stainless steel is easy to clean; just wipe down with mild soap and water and dry with a soft cloth. 

Range hoods made from plastic or wood will typically have shorter lifespans due to their susceptibility to high temperatures or moisture damage over time. If you're looking for an inexpensive option that won't require a lot of upkeep then these materials might be right for you. However, if you want something that will last longer then stainless steel is likely your best bet. 

Frequency of use is another factor that affects how long your range hood will last - the more often it's used the more quickly it will wear out over time. Therefore it’s important to make sure you keep up with regular maintenance such as cleaning filters regularly so that your unit isn't working overtime trying to remove all the grease from cooking activities in your kitchen.. This will help extend its life expectancy significantly! 

Finally, when investing in a new range hood make sure you get one from reliable brand so that it comes with some kind of warranty or guarantee should anything go wrong during its lifetime – this way if there are any issues you know they'll be taken care of quickly without having to replace the entire unit right away! 

Overall, when taken care of properly most rangehoods should last between 10-15 years but this can vary depending on type of material used as well as frequency and regularity of use – so make sure whatever model you choose has been built using quality materials!
