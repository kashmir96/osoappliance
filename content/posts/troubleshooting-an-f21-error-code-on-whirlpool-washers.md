## Troubleshooting an F21 Error Code on Whirlpool Washers

An F21 Error code on a Whirlpool washer can be a frustrating, but relatively common issue. Fortunately, with the right guide, you can identify and fix the problem. Understanding what is causing the error code and the steps you need to take in order to fix the washer is essential in order to get your Whirlpool Washer up and running again.

The F21 error code indicates a drainage problem. This code helps you understand that the water is not draining at all or quickly enough. There are several potential sources for this issue. If your washer is located near a window, this is a possible source, as a window being open during the cycle may cause the water level to be higher, leading to the F21 error code.

Another potential source is clogs in the pump. Check the drain pump in the back of the washer for any objects that may be clogging the hose. If you find any, you can clear the objects with a pair of tweezers. Also check the hose for any debris located near the outlet end that may be causing an obstruction.

In some cases, the drain pump itself may require attention. You can test the electricity going to the pump or open up the housing and clean it. Make sure to wear protective gloves and eyewear while doing this. If these steps don't result in solving the problem, you may need to replace the drain pump or ask a professional for help.

Troubleshooting the F21 error code on Whirlpool washers requires connecting the dots between the various potential sources of the problem. The window, pump, hoses and drain pump are the areas you'll want to look at when trying to solve this issue. With the right information and a bit of effort, you can find the source of the problem and get your washer up and running again.
