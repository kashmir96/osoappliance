## Take Control of Your Refrigerator Error Codes With These Tips

It's no surprise that modern refrigerators often have an array of complex components which require regular maintenance to stay in working order. Whether you own a large Samsung model or a smaller side-by-side, you may encounter error codes that need to be addressed. If you're having difficulty understanding their meaning and how to clear them, here's how to do it.

Most modern Samsung refrigerators feature a LCD display panel that provides feedback when an issue arises. Depending on the model, your display panel will vary but you should be able to find the codes easily. Common error codes and their meanings include:

- 5E: Low refrigerant
- 5E1 and 14E: Malfunction of temperature sensor
- 8E: Malfunction of evaporator fan
- 10E: Shortage of water supply
- 22E: Malfunction of defrost heater

Once you've determined the code, you'll need to reset the refrigerator and the best way to do this is to unplug the power cord for a few seconds and then plug it back in. This will help reset any sensors which may be malfunctioning. Additionally, there may be other issues to address such as cleaning the condenser coils, checking refrigerant levels, cleaning the evaporator fan and replacing the defrost heater.

If your refrigerator is still not working correctly, you may need to have a professional take a look at it. In some cases, you may be able to order replacement parts online and replace them yourself. Knowing what the error codes mean and how to reset the refrigerator can help you troubleshoot these issues.

Taking the time to understand your refrigerator's error codes and how to clear them can help make sure it's kept in working order. Be sure to regularly check for error codes and take the time to diagnose the issue and address it accordingly. With the right tips, you'll be able to keep your Samsung refrigerator running smoothly for years to come.
