Gas heaters are a common and cost-efficient way to keep your home warm during the winter. However, if not installed, maintained, and used correctly, gas heaters can become a major safety hazard. Keep reading to learn more about the dangers of gas heaters and how to keep yourself and your family safe from these risks.

First, all gas heater installations should be done by a professional who understands the safety regulations that come with installing this type of appliance. Improper installation or maintenance can put you at risk for potential carbon monoxide leaks which can cause serious health issues or even death. It is important that you check for any signs of leakage every year to ensure your heater is working properly.

Second, it is important to always use the correct fuel type when using a gas heater. Gas types vary in composition and some can be dangerous if used in an incorrect manner. Always double check what kind of fuel your heater requires before beginning use and have it checked by an expert if you are not sure what type is needed. 

Third, be sure to properly ventilate any area where you are using a gas heater as unventilated areas can lead to unsafe levels of carbon monoxide build up in the air around you which could lead to serious sickness or death if breathed in over time. 

Finally, never leave a running heater unattended as this poses an increased risk for fire hazards or carbon monoxide poisoning due to lack of ventilation in an area where combustible materials may be present such as furniture or curtains near the unit itself. By taking these simple steps and following all safety measures when using a gas heater you will help ensure both your safety as well as that of those around you!
