Furthermore, unplugging the dryer and having an escape plan should always be ready in the event that a dryer fire does occur. Taking the proper steps ahead of time can help prevent fires from occurring and can help limit the damage in the event one does occur. 

Itâ€™s important to be aware of the risk of a dryer fire and to take the necessary steps to prevent such a disaster from occurring. By following a few simple precautionary steps such as regularly checking the dryer filters and making sure the wiring and ventilation are in proper working order, you can reduce the risk of a dryer fire. Furthermore, utilizing a trusted and experienced appliance repair technician is also recommended to ensure that your dryer is functioning properly.
