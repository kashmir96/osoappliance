## Potential Health Hazards of Electrical Microwave Radiation 

Electrical microwave radiation (EMR) is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by many commonly used electrical appliances and devices found in our homes. While EMR may not be visible, its impact on our health can still be significant if not managed appropriately. This blog will explore the potential health risks that may be associated with electrical microwave radiation. 

The majority of our electricity in the home is supplied in the form of EMR. This form of radiation surrounds us as we use cell phones, television sets, microwaves, and other electronic devices. In order to be adequately protected, it’s important to understand the possible risks that EMR can pose. 

One of the primary risks associated with EMR is the potential for destabilizing of our cellular structure. This is due to the fact that the particles of EMR are small and move quickly, a speed that can be disruptive to normal cellular activity. The long-term exposure to such radiation could potentially result in DNA damage that could manifest itself through increased susceptibility to diseases such as cancer. It is also important to note that young children are at an especially increased risk as their cells are still developing.

In addition to cellular damage, there have also been studies that suggest a link between electrical microwave radiation and certain mental health conditions. A number of studies have found that exposure to EMR can increase levels of stress and anxiety in people, leading to more frequent bouts of depression. Furthermore, some experts claim that the radiation is also associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, although this has yet to be conclusively proven. 

Fortunately, there are some easy steps that can be taken to mitigate the potential health risks associated with electrical microwave radiation. The most obvious precaution is to never stand directly in front of an appliance that emits EMR when it is in use and to limit your overall exposure to radiation as much as possible. Additionally, always make sure your home is properly insulated, as this will help to contain and reduce any radiation that has emitted from these devices. 

In conclusion, there is enough evidence to suggest that electrical microwave radiation can potentially have negative impacts on our health. Although the extent of the risks associated with EMR remain uncertain, there are steps that we can take to help limit our exposure and protect ourselves from any potential harm. For reference, we have put together a helpful [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) so that consumers can ensure they are using devices that are up to date with the latest safety standards.
