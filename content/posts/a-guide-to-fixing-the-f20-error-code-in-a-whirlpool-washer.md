## Troubleshooting the f20 Error in a Whirlpool Washer
If you've recently encountered f20 error code on your Whirlpool Washer, don't panic. Here are the steps you should take to get back up and running in no time.

Start by unplugging the washing machine, and then open and close the water valve. The valve may be located behind the machine, or at the end of a water line. Then, check the line itself for any kinks, cracks, or blockages. Make sure that water is flowing freely. This will help prevent the error code from appearing again in the future. 

Next, check the hose and drain pump to ensure that they are free from lint, detergent, or other build up. You may need to remove the hoses and clean them thoroughly. Be sure to keep all connections securely attached, and remove any possible blockages from the drain.

If the problem persists, it may be time to invest in a new washer. But before you replace it, be sure to contact a professional and certified technician to verify that the issue cannot be fixed. That way, you can get your washer running again without the need to purchase a new one.

No one wants to deal with an error code on their washing machine. But by following the steps outlined above and having a little bit of patience, you can diagnose and fix the problem quickly.
