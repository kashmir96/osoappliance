## Enjoy the Health Benefits of Dryer Balls

Dryer balls are often used in many households as a gentler and more natural alternative to fabric softeners and dryer sheets. They reduce static, eliminate wrinkles and soften clothes while also saving energy, money and time. In addition to these, dryer balls have many extra health benefits that are beneficial for the day-to-day life.

Dryer balls are scent-free, so they won’t create an unwanted additional fragrance in your laundry or on your clothes. Traditional fabric softeners and dryer sheets use chemicals to create a scent that we associate with freshness. These synthetic fragrances—which contain a host of potentially hazardous ingredients—may cause health problems, such as respiratory problems, allergies, and skin irritations.

Using dryer balls is a great way to reduce your exposure to these potentially harmful ingredients. Dryer balls are also beneficial for people with sensitive skin, since there is no chemical residue left on your clothing that could later irritate the skin. It is also beneficial to those who suffer from fragrance-sensitivity, since there are no fragrances to trigger a reaction. 

Dryer balls can help to reduce harmful toxins and bacteria that may be released in the air due to the heat generated in the dryer. The movement of the balls within the drum causes a physical agitation of the clothing, helping to break up and eliminate potentially hazardous chemicals.

Plus, these reusable balls last for years, unlike fabric softeners and dryers sheets which you must continuously purchase. This is not only more economical and environmentally friendly, but also more convenient.

To get the most out of your dryer balls, consult a professional appliance repair technician in your local area from our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). This will ensure you get the best performance from your dryer and keep you and your family safe from any potential risks.

## What are Dryer Balls?

**Dryer balls** are an eco-friendly alternative to single-use fabric softening sheets commonly used in the laundry process. They are small, textured, plastic or wool balls that tumble in the dryer with the laundry, reducing drying time and softly agitating the clothes.

## How do Dryer Balls benefit the health?

**Dryer balls** provide numerous health benefits. By reducing the amount of time you have to spend in the dryer, you can avoid the exposure to irritants, such as chemicals and microfibers, that may come off the laundry. Also, by decreasing the amount of time it takes to dry a load, you can use less energy, which helps the environment and your budget. Additionally, dryer balls help to reduce wrinkles and static in clothes so that you don't have to use fabric softeners or other chemical-based products.

## What materials are Dryer Balls made from?

**Dryer balls** are generally made from either plastic or wool. Though plastic dryer balls can be purchased from many retail stores, wool dryer balls are becoming more and more popular. Wool dryer balls are non-toxic, hypoallergenic, and naturally soften fabrics. Additionally, wool dryer balls are more durable than plastic, which means they can be reused for a longer period of time. 

## How do you use Dryer Balls?

Using **dryer balls** is simple and easy. All you need to do is place them in the dryer along with the wet laundry and then start the dryer. The balls will help to fluff up the clothes and reduce drying time by agitating them and helping to keep them separated so that heat circulates more efficiently. Additionally, adding a few drops of your favorite essential oils to the balls will help to give your laundry a lovely scent.

## How often do Dryer Balls need to be replaced?

Depending on the type of **dryer balls** you are using, the frequency of replacing them can vary. Plastic balls typically need to be replaced every 8-10 months, while wool balls can last for up to 2 years. Additionally, it's recommended that you hang wool balls up to dry them out after every few uses. This will help to ensure that your balls last for as long as possible.
