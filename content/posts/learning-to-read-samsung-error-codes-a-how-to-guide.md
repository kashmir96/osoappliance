## Learning to Interpret Samsung Error Codes
If your Samsung appliance isn’t working properly, diagnosis can be hard. One tool that can help you along in your diagnosis journey is Samsung error codes. These codes can provide clues to understanding why your appliance is malfunctioning and how to get it fixed. But interpreting the codes can be frustrating since they are not always clear. 

Fortunately, the codes are organized in a way that makes it possible to decode them yourself. Most Samsung codes are five digits, with the first being a letter that stands for the product line. For example, if the code begins with “F”, it indicates the appliance comes from the Family Hub line. 

The next two digits tell you which product category you are dealing with. The last two digits are specific to the product and tell you what type of error is triggering the code. These last two digits can often be looked up in a reference book to give you a better idea what’s going wrong. 

For more complex errors, the code can provide a general starting point for the diagnosis, but it’s important to get a certified technician to diagnose and repair the appliance.

By understanding Samsung error codes, you can have a better idea of what’s going on with your appliance and how best to get it back up and running. When all else fails, our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview)provides detailed justification on the best appliances on the market to get your home running the way you want.
