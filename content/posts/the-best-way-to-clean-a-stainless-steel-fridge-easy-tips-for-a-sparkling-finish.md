## Effortlessly Clean your Steel Fridge with Everything you Already Have at Home 

Stainless steel fridges are one of the most popular appliances used in households. As we know items can get left to linger in our fridge and create unwanted mess and bacteria. If you’re in need of an efficient way to freshen up your steel fridge, we’ve got the best and quickest way to eliminate any mess, dirt, and grime from your stainless steel. 

The first step to getting your steel fridge looking spotless is to ensure your items are removed and the appliance is unplugged. Remove all items, the shelves and the drawers, before giving the inside and outside of the appliance a wipe down with a soapy damp cloth. Leave it a few minutes to let the soap and water do the trick before wiping off with a paper towel. 

It’s time to move on to removing any bad odours and more stubborn dirt. To tackle this you can use a soft sprinkle of baking soda on the interior to absorb bad smells. Leave it over night, and then the next day give it a gentle wipe with a damp cloth. Get into those harder to reach spots, with an old toothbrush. 

For any parts, like the ice and water trays, that need a more rigorous clean you can use white vinegar. Simply pour it over and let it soak for several minutes before wiping off with a damp cloth. 

The last step is to get that showroom sparkling finish. Use a dry oil free cloth, and then give the stainless steel a gentle buff. Ensure all traces of soap and water is removed so you don’t get any smudges or stains. Finish off with a soft cloth to make your steel fridge gleam.
