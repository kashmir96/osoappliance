## Strategies to Keep Whitewares Looking Good 

Regular maintenance of whiteware items can ensure your household items stay in top condition—making them look like they’re brand new! But how do you clean and keep whiteware items looking good? Keep reading below for 7 tips to clean and maintain your whiteware items. 

A great way to keep whiteware items clean is to regularly wipe down the surfaces. This is especially important when it comes to items like the fridge and oven. To thoroughly get into the crevices, use a toothbrush or cotton swab. However, make sure the cleaner you use is suitable for the item. For example, paint-based cleaners can be used on the oven, while steam cleaning and water is all you need for the fridge. 

Clean refrigerator door gaskets (aka, the rubber seals around the refrigerator doors) are essential for an efficient cooling process. Wipe down the gaskets with a damp cloth and then dry them thoroughly. If the gasket is overly dirty, you can use a solution of dishwashing detergent and lukewarm water, applied with an old toothbrush. 

When it comes to stovetops and ovens, it’s best to clean any spills or splatters straight away. This will prevent them from hardening later, making them harder to clean. You can use oven cleaner spray and a scrubbing brush or cloth to remove spills and splatters. For more stubborn spots, you can use a cloth dampened with white vinegar or baking soda paste, scrubbing it into a circular motion. For electric stoves, the surface should be regularly wiped down with a specialty cleaning product. 

Your dishwasher should be cleaned every three months to clear out any bacteria or mildew in the hose and other parts. Run a cycle with a special dishwasher cleaner. 

Coffee makers and beverage makers should be descaled every 6 to 8 months. This prevents the equipment from becoming clogged, and ensures the taste of coffee and other beverages is unchanged. To descale, first wash all parts that come into contact with water. Then, fill the coffee pot with diluted descaling solution and run a few cycles. For coffee and beverage makers with descaling cycle feature, just fill the water reservoir with descaling solution and run a cycle. 

Your microwave should be regularly given a deep clean. Start by wiping down the outside with a damp cloth or mild soap solution and remove any built-up debris. Then, fill a microwave-safe bowl with two cups of water and the juice of one lemon (or whatever cleaner you like), and put it in the microwave for a few minutes on high. When done, remove the bowl and wipe the grease off the surfaces. 

Finally, washing machines should be cleaned on a regular basis, too. Scrape any dirt from the rubber seal and run a cycle with hot water and a solution of vinegar or bleach. For front-loading machines, clean the door gasket by wiping it with a damp cloth. 

By following these simple tips for cleaning and maintaining your whiteware items, you can ensure your household items stay looking clean and new for longer. Check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to help you find the top items for your home.
