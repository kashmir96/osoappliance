## Is Your Washing Machine Making Lots of Noise? 
If your washing machine produces a loud noise when spinning, don’t worry – you can easily fix this issue yourself. This blog post will guide you through assessing and remedying the problem. 

When your washing machine is running, pay attention to the amount of noise it’s producing. If the sound is normal, you may simply have heard the sound before and not paid attention to it. However, if it is increasingly loud, this could be due to an issue with your washing machine. 

The most common cause of loud noise when spinning is an unbalanced load. To prevent this, always make sure to distribute the weight of your laundry evenly and never overload the appliance. If your washing machine is already in the middle of its cycle and is still making loud noise, you can pause it and re-distribute the clothes. In addition, always use the correct cycle for the type of fabric and the size of your load. 

Other possible causes are worn drum bearings, a faulty motor or motor belt, or a broken suspension rod. If your appliance is under a manufacturer’s warranty, then contact them to have it serviced. If it isn’t under warranty or you don’t want to take too much of a risk with a DIY fix, then look up an appliance repair technician near you in our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).

When assessing the issue, it is important to avoid risking your safety. If a part requires removal and the instructions feel unclear or unclear, then contact a professional right away. Remember to always unplug your appliance before attempting any repairs and/or cleaning. 

In conclusion, a loud noise when your washing machine is spinning can be caused by an unbalanced load, worn drum bearings, a faulty motor, a broken suspension rod, or something else. If you would rather not attempt a DIY fix, then take a look at our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to find someone qualified in your local area.
