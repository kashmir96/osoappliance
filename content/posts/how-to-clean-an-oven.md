# How to clean an oven

If you’ve ever looked at the inside of your oven and thought, “Yikes! That needs a good cleaning,” then this blog is for you. Cleaning an oven may not be the most fun task, but it is important in order to keep your oven functioning properly and to prevent food from burning. Here are some tips for how to clean an oven effectively: 

1. Start by removing the racks from your oven. Set them aside in a bucket filled with soapy water and let them soak while you work on cleaning the inside of the oven. 

2. Next, create a cleaning solution using one part baking soda and one part water. Mix these together until it forms a paste-like consistency that is thick enough to spread across the surfaces of your oven without dripping off too much. 

3. Using a damp cloth or sponge, spread the baking soda solution over all of the surfaces inside your oven that need cleaning (avoiding any electrical components). Allow this paste to sit for at least 15-20 minutes before wiping away with a damp cloth or sponge again. 

4. If there are still some stubborn food stains or residue clinging to your oven walls, try using white vinegar and an abrasive scrubbing pad or steel wool instead of baking soda mixture to help lift these up more easily (just be sure not to use anything too abrasive on silicone surfaces to avoid damaging them). 

5. Finally, remove the racks from their soaking bucket and dry them off with a clean towel before replacing them in your now sparklingly clean oven!

In conclusion, cleaning an oven isn’t the most fun task, but it’s important in order to keep your oven running properly and free of burnt food. By following these steps and using baking soda, white vinegar, and a soft scrubbing pad or steel wool when needed, you can have your oven looking sparkly clean in no time.
