## Unlocking the Secrets of Diagnostics on Your Beko Washing Machine
Are you looking to troubleshoot your Beko washing machine in search of a solution to an error code or other issue? Read on to learn how to run through the diagnostics on your Beko washing machine and get to the bottom of your issue quickly and easily. 

Running diagnostics on your Beko washing machine involves running the washer through a mock cycle that allows you to identify where the fault lies. This mock cycle will help you to identify faults and diagnose any issues with the machine such as poor draining, excessive vibration, noise, or a specific fault code.

Generally, you can easily access the diagnostics by pressing a particular key combination on the washer's control panel at certain intervals throughout the machine's cycle. Refer to your user manual for specific details, as these can differ between models. 

Once you’ve accessed the diagnostics, the machine will essentially begin running a pretend cycle. It is important to note that you should not put any clothing or fabric inside the machine as it runs through this cycle. During this ‘mock cycle’, the diagnostics test will work through various sections such as the door lock, filters, drain pump, etc. You can monitor the diagnostics progress on the LCD screen or through an error code.

Identifying any relevant error codes is the most effective way to diagnose issues with your machine. This is why it’s recommended to familiarise yourself with the error codes for your particular model, so you’ll have a better understanding of what the code is telling you. If you’re not sure what an error code means, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) is a great resource for reference. 

After the testing is complete, it's likely you will have identified the fault, making it easy for you to rectify it. If not, then you may need to seek assistance from a qualified technician.
