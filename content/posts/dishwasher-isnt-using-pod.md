If your dishwasher isn't using dishwasher pods, it could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things to check before you call a repairman:

1. Is the dishwasher full of dishes? If the dishwasher is too full, the dishwasher pod may not be able to reach all the dishes and be effective. Make sure the dishwasher is not overloaded.

2. Is the dishwasher in the correct cycle? Dishwasher pods are designed to work in certain cycles, such as the heavy or normal cycle. Make sure the dishwasher is in the correct cycle for the pod to be effective.

3. Is the dishwasher pod expired? Dishwasher pods have a shelf life and can expire. Check the expiration date on the package and make sure the pod is still good.

4. Is the dishwasher pod too old? Dishwasher pods can become less effective over time, so if the pod is more than a few months old, it may not be working properly.

5. Is the dishwasher pod stored properly? Dishwasher pods should be stored in a cool, dry place. If the pod has been exposed to moisture or heat, it may not be working properly.

If none of these solutions seem to work, it may be time to call a repairman. A professional can diagnose the issue and help you get your dishwasher working properly again.
