## Troubleshooting a Boiler Error Code 28

Having your boiler malfunction can be stressful, especially if you're unsure of the issue at hand. Luckily, modern cooling systems and boilers feature error or fault codes which can help you identify the underlying issue quickly and easily. This post will discuss the specifics of error code 28 as well as how you can go about troubleshooting it. 

Error code 28 typically indicates an issue with the water temperature. This may include a high temperature cutoff switch that is tripped or an actual water temperature that is too high. Checking the pipe and using a multi-meter will be necessary to confirm the fault code. 

The first step in troubleshooting an error code 28 is verifying the status of the pipe attached to the boiler, as it is the most common cause. There is a possibility that there is air trapped in the pipe, which could cause the error code 28 to appear. Make sure to give the pipe several seconds to fully fill. If there is no blockage in the pipe, the high-temperature cutoff switch may be the problem.

To check the high temperature cutoff switch, you will need to use a multimeter to check the current status of the switch. This can easily be done by connecting a multimeter probe to the two terminals on the switch and then testing the resistance to see if it is working correctly. If the resistance does not match correctly, it could be an indication that the switch is not functioning correctly and will need to be replaced.

If these measures don't seem to fix the problem or the issue persists, further diagnosis may be required. You may need to contact a professional in order to have them diagnose the exact cause of the error.

Error code 28 can be a tricky issue to handle and can require more detailed troubleshooting. However, with the right steps and tools, you should be able to diagnose the underlying issue and get your boiler back up and running in no time.

## FAQ: How to Resolve a 28 Error Code on Your Boiler

1. What is a 28 error code on my boiler?
The 28 error code on a boiler indicates that your boiler malfunctioned during the startup sequence. This could be due to a lack of power, a faulty component, or a misalignment of some sort.

2. How do I troubleshoot this issue?
To troubleshoot this issue, you should start by checking the power supply to your boiler. Make sure it is plugged in and turned on properly and that the power is switched on at the mains. Also check the circuit breakers and fuses that serve your boiler to make sure they are still in working order.

3. What should I do if the power supply appears to be in working order?
If the power supply appears to be in working order, you should inspect the internal components of your boiler. Check the igniter, gas valve, and any safety components to make sure they are in proper working condition and that all the wiring is securely connected.

4. Are there any other checks I can do? 
If you cannot identify a specific problem, you should have your boiler professionally serviced and inspected by a certified heating expert. Boilers are complex machines and a 28 error code could indicate other issues that only a certified technician can identify and repair.

5. What should I do if the boiler does not return to normal operation?
If your boiler does not return to normal operation after troubleshooting and having it inspected, it is likely you will need to replace some components or the entire boiler. It is important to contact a certified technician to assess the situation before replacing components or the boiler.
