## Dealing with Washing Machine Error Codes 
Are you getting an error code on your washing machine? Don't worry, decoding these error codes and fixing the problem is often an easy task. Here’s a guide on how to work through these errors.

When your washing machine gives off an error code, the first step is to identify what that code is. You can find this in your washing machine’s manual. Once you know the code, you can refer back to your manual and the manufacturer’s website to help you work out what the code means and how to fix the issue. 

Often the issue can be solved by simply resetting the machine. Switch off the machine and unplug it for a few minutes before turning it back on and starting a new cycle. If you still get an error code, you may need to check some parts of your machine. This could include checking the drainage filter, making sure the washing detergent dispenser isn’t blocked, and checking the pipes and hoses.

If the issue still remains unresolved, it may be time to call an appliance repair expert. Don’t attempt to repair the machine yourself if you are not sure of what you are doing. For most brands you can find the contact details for the local service expert on their website.

An error code doesn’t mean the end of your washing machine. With a few simple steps you can diagnose the code and fix the problem. If you are unable to do this yourself, contact an appliance repair expert to handle the problem. For your peace of mind, here at Part Yur Plan, our [Appliance Parts Suppliers](./pages/appliance-parts-suppliers/) are ready to help you find the right part for your washing machine.

## Unravelling Error Codes on Your Washing Machine: FAQs

1. **What kinds of error codes might appear on my washing machine?** 
The types of error codes you might see vary by washing machine model and brand. In general, common error codes include “LE” (meaning an issue with the washer’s motor drive or signal), “SE” (meaning an issue with the motor’s speed control or sensing), “FF” (meaning a problem with the door lock, and “UE” (meaning an unbalanced load).

2. **What should I do when I see an error code on my washing machine?**
Before attempting to diagnose and troubleshoot the issue, make sure to unplug the appliance from power. Once it’s safe to do so, consult your owner’s manual to determine what the displayed code means. If it’s something you can address on your own, you can then take the proper steps to fix it.

3. **How do I resolve the error code “LE” if it appears?**
This code usually indicates an issue with the motor drive or signal. If cleaning the motor and motor pulley, as well as checking the wiring, doesn’t resolve the issue, a technician may need to replace the motor and motor control board.

4. **If the error code “SE” appears, what is the most likely cause?**
This code often indicates an issue with the motor’s speed control sensor. It’s important to make sure that the wiring and all the control systems are working correctly. If the wiring is ok, you may need a technician to replace the motor control board.

5. **What should I do if the error code “FF” appears?**
This error code generally points to a problem with the door lock. Inspect the wiring, door lock assembly and door latch assembly to see if any problems arise. If any of these components are malfunctioning or loose, they will need to be tightened or replaced.

2. To fix the issue, reset the machine and ensure the drainage filter, dispenser and pipes/hoses are working properly.
