Are you looking for a way to cook with natural heat and efficiency? Wood stoves are a great option, and they are becoming increasingly popular in Christchurch. Wood burning stoves offer a traditional yet efficient way of cooking, as well as providing a source of warmth and ambiance in your home.

When using a wood stove, it is important to choose the right type of wood to use. The type of wood you choose will determine how efficient the stove will be, how hot it will get, and how long it will last. In Christchurch, the most common types of wood used in wood stoves are pine and macrocarpa. Pine is the most affordable option but can burn quickly so it needs to be replenished often. Macrocarpa is denser than pine so it burns more slowly and evenly, making it ideal for longer cooking times. It also has more heat output than pine so it’s better for heating up larger spaces.

Aside from choosing the right type of wood for your stove, there are other factors to consider when using a wood stove in Christchurch. Make sure that your chimney is regularly checked by a professional chimney sweep to ensure that there are no blockages or build-up that could cause smoke or dangerous fumes to enter your home. You should also make sure that you use seasoned firewood – freshly cut logs can produce smoke due to their high moisture content – so always check the moisture content before buying firewood for your stove.

Using a wood stove can be an incredibly rewarding experience if done correctly. Not only does it provide warmth and ambiance but with the right type of firewood, you can create delicious meals with natural heat!
