Bosch heat pumps are designed to provide energy efficient heating and cooling for your home. While the heat pump itself is a great way to keep your home comfortable, there are several accessories that can help you get even more out of your investment. Here we’ll discuss some of the most popular Bosch heat pump accessories and how they can help you save money and make your home even more comfortable.

The first accessory we’ll discuss is the Bosch Heat Pump Controller. This device allows you to monitor and adjust the temperature of your home from a remote location using an app on your smartphone or tablet. The controller allows you to set up multiple heating and cooling schedules, enabling you to optimize energy use in different parts of the house at different times of day or night. The controller also has a built-in timer, so it can automatically turn off after a certain period of time if no one is present in the house. 

Another great accessory for Bosch heat pumps is their solar thermal system. This system harnesses the power of sunlight to assist with heating your home during periods when electricity costs are high or when traditional heating sources aren’t available due to weather conditions. The solar thermal system is designed with special collector panels that absorb solar radiation from the sun during daylight hours, storing it as hot water in an insulated tank for later use as needed throughout the day or night. 

Finally, Bosch offers several air purification systems that can be used with their heat pumps as well. These systems remove dust, pollen, smoke particles, pet dander, bacteria, and other airborne contaminants from indoor air – helping reduce allergies while improving overall air quality in your home. Many models also feature advanced filters that trap ultrafine particles such as mold spores and smoke particles – making them perfect for anyone suffering from asthma or other respiratory conditions who needs extra protection against indoor air pollutants .
