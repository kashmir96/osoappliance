## Disposing of Unwanted Kitchen Appliances 
When you have kitchen appliances that you no longer need, disposing of them can often be a challenge. From large or bulky appliances to small electrical appliances, accurate and responsible disposal is an important part of being a conscientious consumer. 

The most important factor in disposing of kitchen appliances is to determine if it’s possible to donate, recycle or repurpose the appliance. Many local community centers will accept donations of unwanted items and resell them to benefit the community, while electric items may be eligible for recycling programs that erase the data in the appliance and put them back on the market. Repurposing appliances to suit a hobby, such as using a bread maker to slow cook meals, may be a great way to put them to use.

If the item cannot be donated, recycled or repurposed, you’ll need to dispose of it properly. For appliances that use gas, it’s important to ensure the item is in safe working order before disposing of it. Since gas appliances may use a combustible gas, visiting a specialized shop or company is the safest way to dispose of these. Other electrical items should be recycled or disposed of according to the local municipal codes and regulations.

In some cases, the original store where you purchased the kitchen appliance will have a program to help you properly dispose of it and help you exchange for a newer model. While this is primarily ideal for within warranty, it may still be beneficial for older appliances and will have the added convenience of disposal being handled by the store or manufacturer.

Disposing of kitchen appliances in the proper way is an important part of being a conscientious consumer. Where possible, look into donation and repurposing to extend the life of the appliance and help out those in need. If you need to dispose of the appliance, contact appliances stores and manufacturers to see if they have a disposal program, or contact your local municipal codes and regulations office to learn more about the proper way to dispose of the item.
