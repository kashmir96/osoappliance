## Identifying and Fixing Broke Air Conditioner Thermostats

When the summer comes, a cool breeze inside your home is a welcome respite. Air conditioners provide a much-needed reprieve in the heat of the summer. But when your air conditioner’s thermostat stops functioning, it can be a huge inconvenience. In this blog, we'll discuss the potential causes and the steps one can take to diagnose and fix a broken air conditioner thermostat. 

First, check the batteries: low or aged batteries can be the culprit of a failed thermostat. If the batteries are ok, then the problem could be more complicated and require additional diagnostic steps. It’s important to identify and properly diagnose the problem before taking any steps to repair it.

If the thermostat malfunction is occurring only in relation to the air conditioner, then it’s likely a wiring issue. To fix the problem, you should unplug the power and inspect the wiring for any frays or other signs of damage. It’s also important to make sure that the wires are securely connected to the circuit board.

In some cases, the problem may not be the thermostat itself, but the air conditioner’s internal temperature sensor. If the sensor is not functioning correctly, it may be reading the internal temperature incorrectly, resulting in the air conditioner turning on or off unexpectedly. To rule out a bad temperature sensor as the cause of the issue, you can temporarily bypass the temperature sensor.

Finally, if all of the appropriate steps have been taken and the issue still exists, then the issue may be a malfunctioning part on the circuit board. This can result in the thermostat not reading the temperature correctly or not controlling the air conditioner properly. In this case, you’ll need to replace the faulty part, or the entire circuit board itself, to correct the issue.

In conclusion, broken air conditioner thermostats can be a real nuisance. Fortunately, most of the time the fix is as easy as replacing the batteries or reattaching a wire. For more involved repair scenarios, it’s safest to rely on an experienced appliance repair technician.
