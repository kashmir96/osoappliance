## Resetting Your Refrigerator's Compressor
There may come a time when your refrigerator is having difficulty staying at the proper setting and the compressor just isn’t cooling like it used to. In this case, you may be able to reset your refrigerator’s compressor and get it back to peak performance.

Before resetting the compressor, it’s important to check for any error codes displayed on the display or blinking lights that may indicate a specific issue. This can help narrow down the possible solutions which can save time and energy when troubleshooting. 

A refrigerator compressor is the motor that powers the cooling system to maintain the desired temperature inside the appliance. The reason for resetting the compressor may be due to a settings issue, temperature settings, faulty parts, or simply to restore the system to factory settings.

Once your refrigerator is powered on, the compressor will kick on and off in a cycle to keep the temperature at the desired setting. If the compressor is unable to maintain the proper temperature or turns off after a short period of time, it will need to be reset.

In order to reset the compressor, you’ll first need to unplug the refrigerator from the wall outlet and disconnect any additional items such as water lines or ice makers. Once everything is disconnected, press and hold the reset button on the compressor for approximately 10 seconds. 

Once the reset process is complete, it’s important to check the settings on the refrigerator to make sure they are at the desired level. It’s also important to check for any warning signs such as noise coming from the compressor or lights blinking that may indicate a deeper issue. If the issue persists, a service call may be necessary.
