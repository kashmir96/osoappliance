## Easily Calculate Electrical Appliance Usage 
Keeping track of energy consumption from household appliances can be confusing and time-consuming. Luckily, there are easy and accurate tools available to help you calculate your usage for easy budgeting and to monitor consumption for a greener lifestyle.

For household appliances that have a smart technology attached, energy monitoring tends to be more straightforward. Smart devices display energy consumption in real-time, and then store that data for easy tracking and calculations. Non-smart appliances still have solutions available for tracking to calculate use. There are manual instructions for tracking, such as manually timing and calculating, but this can be difficult to do consistently. Electrical meters, such as power strips with this technology, can also be used to measure appliance usage. 

Fortunately, most appliances today have an energy efficiency label with an estimate of average energy usage by hour. This can be used to calculate an approximate usage of the appliance in a given month. It’s also important to look at the length of time the appliance will be used and compare with the label to arrive at a more accurate calculation.

For a more exact calculation, most utility companies can provide a report of energy usage over time to help monitor and measure the energy usage of all appliances combined. This can help identify which appliances are using the most electricity, and it’s a great resource for budgeting energy expenses. 

To better manage appliance energy consumption, consider having them serviced by a professional technician. Keeping up with repair and maintenance is important for ensuring optimal energy efficiency in every appliance.

## Calculating Electrical Appliance Consumption

1. What factors influence my electrical appliance consumption?
 - Several factors influence your electrical appliance consumption, including wattage, energy-usage rating, and how often the appliance is used.

2. How can I calculate my electrical appliance consumption?
 - You can calculate your electrical appliance consumption with the equation: Watts x Hours Used Per Day / 1000 x Number of Days = Kilowatt-hour (kWh).

3. How do I know how many watts my appliance uses?
 - You can usually find the watts usage on the appliance's label.

4. What does the energy-usage rating of the appliance mean?
 - The energy-usage rating is a measure of how much energy an appliance consumes during the course of a year.

5. What is a Kilowatt-hour (kWh)?
 - A Kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a measure of how much energy an appliance requires over the course of one hour. It is equal to 1000 watts of energy consumed in one hour.
