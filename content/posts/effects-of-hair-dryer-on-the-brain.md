Hair dryers are a common part of most people’s daily grooming routines. However, you may be surprised to learn that using a hair dryer can have an effect on your brain. According to recent research, the sound and vibrations from hair dryers can cause changes in your brainwaves and even alter your mood.

The noise from a hair dryer is usually quite loud and this can be disruptive to our brains. Studies have shown that exposure to loud noises, such as those from a hair dryer, can lead to increased levels of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. This means that even if we don’t consciously notice the sound of the hair dryer it may still affect our emotional state in an adverse way by increasing feelings of anxiety or agitation.

In addition, research has also suggested that exposure to continuous noise or vibration (such as those produced by using a hairdryer) can lead to changes in our brainwave patterns. These changes indicate reduced levels of alertness which could lead us into feeling more relaxed or sleepy than usual—not great if you’re trying to get ready for work! 

The good news is that these effects seem largely reversible; once you switch off the hairdryer it should take very little time for your brainwaves and emotions return back to normal! So while it might not be advisable to use a hairdryer immediately before trying something mentally demanding (like studying for exams), there doesn’t seem any need for alarm about its short-term effects on our brains either!
