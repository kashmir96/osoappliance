## Are Broken Dryer Vents Dangerous?
Using a dryer is a convenient way to get your clothes dry and ready to go, but a faulty dryer vent is a potential fire hazard. A broken dryer vent can create a number of dangers, such as excess heat and smoke accumulation from lint build-up and blocked airflow, which can pose a significant risk to your safety and home. In this article, we will discuss the dangers of a broken dryer vent and why it is important to have it repaired as soon as possible. 

A dryer vent's primary purpose is to safely remove warm air and lint from the unit and outdoors. If a dryer vent is broken, the hot air and lint can build up in the unit, creating a dangerous environment for your entire home. Excess heat can cause electrical systems and wires to overheat, leading to potential fires. An increase in lint in the dryer or vents can also block airflow and damage the unit, leading to further risks. 

Even if the dryer is functioning and able to be used, a broken vent can cause a decrease in performance. A dryer will require extra power to push hot air and lint out of the unit, leading to an increase in electric bills. The overload of power can also increase wear and tear to the system, leading to breakdowns and impairing its lifespan.
