Cleaning your dishwasher is an important part of keeping your kitchen clean and hygienic. Not only does a clean dishwasher help keep your dishes clean, but it also helps to prevent the build-up of bacteria and other contaminants. Here are some tips on how to clean your dishwasher for optimal performance.

1. Start with a basic rinse: Start by running an empty cycle with hot water to rinse away any food particles or residue.

2. Clean the filter: Remove the filter and rinse it with hot water. If it is especially dirty, you can scrub it with a brush and some dish soap.

3. Clean the interior: Use a damp cloth to wipe down the interior of the dishwasher, paying special attention to the seal around the door.

4. Sanitize: To sanitize the dishwasher, use a mixture of 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Run a cycle with hot water and the vinegar/baking soda mixture.

5. Deodorize: To deodorize your dishwasher, sprinkle some baking soda on the bottom of the dishwasher and run a cycle with hot water.

6. Clean the exterior: Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior of the dishwasher.

Following these steps will help ensure your dishwasher is clean and running efficiently. Regular cleaning will help extend the life of your dishwasher and keep it running smoothly.
