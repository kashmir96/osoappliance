No, it is not legal to rent a house without air conditioning. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires that all rental units meet basic health and safety standards. One of these standards includes the requirement for air conditioning in all rental units. 

Air conditioning is an important part of any residential living space, as it helps to ensure that the temperature in the building remains at a comfortable level throughout the year. Without air conditioning, temperatures can become too hot or too cold, making it difficult or impossible for tenants to live comfortably in the home. Additionally, air conditioning helps to reduce humidity levels inside the home, which can help with mold growth and other issues associated with poor air quality. 

In addition to HUD regulations, some states have their own laws regarding minimum temperature requirements in rental properties. These laws require that landlords provide tenants with safe and comfortable living conditions by maintaining temperatures at a certain level during specific times of year. For example, Californiaâ€™s Tenant Protection Act requires landlords to maintain indoor temperatures between 68 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit from October 1st through May 31st each year (except in extreme circumstances). 

Ultimately, renting a home without air conditioning is not legal under both federal and state regulations due to its importance for tenant health and comfort. Therefore, before renting a property you should ensure it has an adequate cooling system installed so you can enjoy comfortable living conditions all year round!
