## Say Goodbye to Those Pesky Laundry Worries with an App

Getting through your laundry may seem like a monumental task. Especially when you have to make sure all your clothes are cleaned in the right way and you don’t want anything to shrink, fade or otherwise be damaged. But with the help of a simple but very powerful app, you can take the headache out of doing your laundry.

The CSC laundry app was designed to be used with a CSC washing machine and would be beneficial to any family or individual household who finds the laundry a chore. With the app you can monitor the progress of multiple washing machines at the same time, set and adjust washing cycles to tailor them to specific types of clothes, get laundry care tips delivered based on your washing cycle, and even update and check the appliance’s current settings.

The app also includes auto-detect technology, a feature that reads and understands your washing machine’s settings, even after a power cut or disruption. This type of tech ensures your clothes are washed at the right temperature and any pre-set changes to the temperature, water usage and wash duration are preserved.

These features make it tasks much easier and less time consuming so whether you’re a busy family or a young professional, the CSC laundry app is sure to be a great help!

Having a laundry app on your phone or tablet should come as a welcome bonus for stressed-out homeowners and busy professionals.
