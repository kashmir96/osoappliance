## Keep That Washing Machine Working by Following These Tips
Every homeowner knows washing machines donâ€™t last forever, but when a malfunction occurs it can be a costly surprise. Repairs and replacements are not always cheap, so it pays to take preventive action before problems arise. Below are some important tips on avoiding a dead washing machine and expense replacement.

### Get Routine Maintenance 
As with any appliance, regular maintenance goes a long way in keeping it running efficient and effectively. It is recommended that customers have a professional come out to their home at least every six months to inspect, clean and ensure all components are running properly. If a repair is needed, take the time to address it promptly and properly. 

### Be Careful What You Wash 
While most washing machines are designed to handle items like denim and towels, understand that certain items like stuffed animals are more difficult for the machine to process. These items can clog the drains and become wedged in the large drum, potentially damaging the machine and requiring a new washer.

### Handle With Care 
When loading clothes and unloading, take extra care to ensure the door is securely closed and the revolving drum is protected. Doing laundry around children can be difficult; however, the parents should be sure to prevent their children or any objects from getting caught between the door and the drum.

### Understand the Warranty 
It may be worth it to purchase an extended warranty that offers coverage beyond what the original factory warranty claims. Understanding the terms and conditions of the warranty before an emergency happens can help avoid a costly surprise. 

Following these tips can help keep a seven-year-old washer running properly and avoid having to replace it prematurely. Knowing when to call a professional technician can be the difference between a repair and a new washer.
