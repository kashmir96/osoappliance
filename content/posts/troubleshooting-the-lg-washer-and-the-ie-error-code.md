## Steps to Resolve the LG Washer IE Error Code
No one wants to find themselves facing an appliance error code - especially for a much needed appliance like a washing machine. If you find your LG washer displaying “IE” in its panel, you don’t need to panic. This error code simply means the washing machine is not filling properly and there may be a simpler issue causing it than you think. 

The first step to troubleshooting this issue is to check your water supply line and make sure it is connected properly and is not blocked. It is also important to check the inlet hose filter for any blockages such as lint, hair, etc. If either of these are backup, simply clean out these potentially clogged parts and try running a cycle again. 

Another possible cause of the IE error code is a malfunction in the water pressure switch. This is a hydraulic switch located at the bottom of the tub, and it is responsible for turning the water pump on and off according to water level. Test the water pressure switch for issues like continuity and calibration. Asking a appliance repair technician for a diagnosis of the problem may be useful in this situation.

Finally, the IE code may be due to a mechanical fault in the washing machine. Check for any loose parts, broken wiring or a failed electronic board. Inspect the water levels during a cycle and be sure to take note of any strange or unexpected behaviour.

No one likes dealing with appliance error codes, but with a few simple steps it might not be so bad. Make sure to check all of the straightforward issues first and have a certified appliance repair technician take a look if the issue persists. Then you will be on your way towards resolution and operating your LG washer the way you need it to.
