## Uncovering the Causes and Solutions to Troubleshoot Your Maytag Washer's F15 Error Code

Is your Maytag washer displaying the F15 Error Code? There likely is a problem with the washer's water valve, temperature sensor, or circuit board and itâ€™s time to troubleshoot. In many cases, the problems can be solved without the help of a professional, but if the problem persists after attempting these steps please reach out to a duly vetted and experienced appliance repair technician available through our [directory](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).

The F15 Error Code indicates that the washer is not filling with water and the washer will be in a suspended washing cycle. A few suggested steps to take when troubleshooting can include checking the water supply, clearing the water valves of debris, conducting a water supply test, and running a diagnostic test. 

First, it is important to ensure the water supply is turned on and the water is flowing - this can be checked with a simple visual inspection. If water supply is not the issue and your washer is still displaying the F15 Error Code, it is recommended to check the water inlet valve filters and screens and clear any debris or sediment.

If the water supply is on and the valves are free of debris, it is advised to conduct a water supply test. By pressing power off and cycle Signal buttons simultaneously on the washer, a test cycle begins and the inlet valve opens, allowing the water to flow into the washer. If proper water pressure is not detected, an F15 Error Code appears. This could indicate an issue with the water pressure or the water inlet valves.

Lastly, to check for any contact or electronic errors, it may be necessary to run a diagnostic test. Running a diagnostic test is best left to a professional appliance repair technician as it requires specialized tools and knowledge.

In conclusion, troubleshooting the F15 Error Code on your Maytag washer can be done on your own, but in some cases it may require professional help for successful repair.
