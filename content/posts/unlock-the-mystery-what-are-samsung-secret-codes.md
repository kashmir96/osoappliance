Are you looking to unlock the mystery of Samsung secret codes? Keep reading to find out what these unique codes mean and why theyâ€™re important. 

Samsung secret codes are used by technicians, device owners, and devlopers to get access to device-specific settings and features, such as factory test mode. These codes are unique to the Samsung device and are not universal codes like those used for mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. When entered into the device, these codes provide access to a variety of menus and options for viewing or changing settings. 

Although Samsung secret codes are designed for experienced users, some of the settings may also be useful for general users, such as the maintenance mode which can be used to reset the device and make general repairs. Additionally, some of these codes can allow users to view more information about the device including detailed hardware information, such as temperature, source of power, and charging status.

Samsung also makes use of its own names for various settings, features and options which may be confusing for users who are not familiar with the brand. But, by entering the appropriate secret code, users can access the desired section of the device and make changes accordingly.
