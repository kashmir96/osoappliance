If you've ever had the unfortunate experience of having your oven glass door shatter, you know how jarring it can be. Oven glass doors are designed to withstand high temperatures and provide a safe way to monitor your food while it cooks. So, why did your oven door shatter?

There are several potential causes for a shattered oven glass door. The first is thermal shock. Thermal shock occurs when there is a sudden change in temperature inside the oven, causing extreme stress on the glass. This could happen if you were to open and close the door repeatedly or if you were to put cold food in a preheated oven. Another possible cause of thermal shock is if you were to accidentally turn off the oven while something was cooking inside.

Another possible cause of shattered glass is mechanical shock, which occurs when something hits the glass hard enough to break it. This could happen if you drop something heavy near the door or if something falls onto the door from above.

Finally, some types of oven glass may not be able to withstand extreme temperatures for long periods of time, especially if they're old or have been exposed to a lot of heat over time. If this is the case, then even normal use of your oven could eventually cause the glass to shatter.

No matter what caused your oven's glass door to shatter, it's important that you replace it as soon as possible for safety reasons. Make sure that you purchase an appropriate replacement from your manufacturer or an authorized retailer and follow all instructions for installation carefully so that it doesn't happen again.
