## Troubleshooting Bosch Dishwasher Error Code E15

Bosch dishwashers all come with several standard, built-in error codes to alert you when something may be going wrong. Error Code E15 is one of these codes, and if it's showing on your Bosch dishwasher, it's important to understand what it means and how to go about fixing the problem.

When Error Code E15 pops up, it typically indicates a draining issue, and can have a few causes. The most likely culprits are a clogged filter, an issue with the drain pump, or a kink in the drain hose. Checking the filter is an easy task, and can usually be done by first opening the dishwasher door. Depending on your dishwasher model, you may be able to remove the filter by simply unscrewing it and cleaning it out. For some models, you'll need to remove a panel on the bottom front side to access the filter and be able to remove it.

If the filter is clean, the problem may be with the drain pump, which requires you to remove the dishwasher from the counter, unplug it, and then unscrew the panels so you can access the drain pump and check it for possible clogs. You should also check the drain hose and determine if it is kinked â€“ if so, it may need to be straightened and reattached.

In any case, these steps should help you identify and fix the cause of the Error Code E15. If you're still encountering the issue, however, it's best to contact a professional and authorized Bosch technician to look into the issue.

So, if you're faced with Error Code E15 on your Bosch dishwasher, definitely take the necessary steps to troubleshoot and fix the problem. If you're not familiar with the codes or unsure as to how to go about fixing the issue, our Comprehensive Appliances Error Codes Glossary can help point you in the right direction.
