## An Overview of Commercial Dishwasher Costs 
Purchasing and maintaining a commercial dishwasher is often an expensive endeavor, but having one can be a worthwhile investment if you use it correctly. Understanding the factors that go into the total cost of a commercial dishwasher will help you make an informed decision and keep costs in check.

The primary factor that will affect the cost of a commercial dishwasher is the size of the unit. Larger dishwashers can accommodate more dishes to keep up with high-volume restaurant needs, and will naturally incur more costs. Another potential cost to consider is the type of power source. Commonly used power sources for these units are electric, steam, and direct injection of hot water into the machinery. Any power source should be thoroughly evaluated to determine its operational efficiency.

Labor costs associated with the repair and upkeep of your commercial dishwasher are also something to consider when budgeting. These costs can be kept to a minimum if regular maintenance is performed and any issues or malfunctions are identified in a timely manner. Additionally, some dishwashers require special plumbing connections or on-site installation, which can increase the total cost of ownership.

There are some other supplemental costs to consider when budgeting for your commercial dishwasher. Additional features like adjustable racks and digital readouts could increase costs. Non-standard components like scrap trays, power cords, and hose kits can also add to the total cost.

Understanding the total cost of a commercial dishwasher can help you make an educated decision when investing in restaurant equipment. Investing in the right size and type of machine for your needs will ensure maximum efficiency and will minimize associated costs.
