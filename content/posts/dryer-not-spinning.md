# Dryer not spinning

If you’ve noticed your dryer isn’t spinning, there are a few potential causes. Before calling in an expert, there are a few simple steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem yourself.

One common cause of a dryer not spinning is a broken belt. The belt moves the drum and allows your clothes to tumble. To check this, open up the back panel of your dryer and inspect the belt for signs of wear or breakage. If it looks worn or damaged, it may need replacement.

Another potential cause is something blocking the drum from spinning freely. Remove any clothing items that may be stuck inside and check around the sides and door area for any foreign objects or debris that could be interfering with its movement. Also look for signs of overheating; if this is happening, you may need to replace some internal components such as heating elements or coils.

Finally, inspect your dryer's motor and pulley system to make sure everything is working properly and nothing has become loose or misaligned over time. If something appears out of place, make sure all screws are tight before turning on the machine again. 

If none of these steps resolves your problem after some inspection, it may be time to call in an expert for further help with diagnosing and fixing the issue with your dryer not spinning correctly!
