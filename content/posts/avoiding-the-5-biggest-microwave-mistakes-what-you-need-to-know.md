## Essential Tips to Prevent Unwanted Microwave Mishaps 
The microwave oven has revolutionized the way we cook. But sometimes, ovens can experience storage or power issues. Thankfully, there are a few simple steps that can minimize potential issues and keep your microwave oven functioning efficiently.
 
### Are You Making These 5 Errors? 
The most common microwave missteps include: 
1. Placing metal in the oven. 
2. Allowing food to spill inside the oven and not cleaning up promptly. 
3. Not covering food when heating.
4. Setting the timer longer than necessary. 
5. Not taking note of the wattage of your microwave.

### Mistake #1: Placing Metal in the Oven
It’s a common misconception that it’s ok to put metal into the microwave. However, putting metal into the oven can cause sparks, which can damage the oven and result in a dangerous fire hazard.

### Waste Not 
In addition to keeping metal away from microwaves, it’s also important to avoid letting food bits fall inside the oven. Doing so can actually cause the heating elements and fan of the oven to malfunction. Make sure to clean all food debris regularly to keep your microwave working properly.

### Cover it Up 
Covering all food items when heating can also help prolong a microwave’s life. This is because food items can splatter, resulting in a mess. Food splatter covered by a plate or lid can be easily wiped off, whereas molten food splatter that enters the fan and interior of the oven can create larger issues. 

### Timing Is Everything 
It can be tempting to set a microwave to run for longer than necessary in order to ensure food items are cooked through, however, this can cause ‘arcing’. In other words, food particles drawn onto metallic surfaces inside the oven can cause sparks.

Finally, it’s important to remember to take note of the wattage of your microwave oven. Most microwaves come with wattage information listed on the oven itself. Setting wattage too high can cause affecting microwaves ability to cook items evenly.
