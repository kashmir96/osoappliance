###### Get Rid of Unwanted Whiteware for FREE in Wellington Now

Are you a Wellington resident with a collection of outdated and unwanted whiteware (household appliances) taking up space in your home or garage? If so, we have great news for you! 

Thanks to the Wellington City Council and a WasteMINZ nationwide initiative, you can now have your whiteware collected from your home and recycled for FREE (terms & conditions apply). This initiative offers a great opportunity to responsibly dispose of your whiteware in a responsible manner. 

The whiteware collection service covers all whiteware appliances, such as fridge freezers, microwaves and toasters, with a maximum size restriction of 1.5 metres – any bigger items should be evaluated case-by-case with the collection service. 

Once you’ve made the necessary preparations prior to the collection, such as draining and defrosting a fridge freezer, the collection service will take your appliance to the nearest recycling centre where the materials will be responsibly disposed of.
