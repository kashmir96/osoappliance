If you’re using a water cooler, it may seem like you’re getting an endless supply of clean, refreshing drinking water. But unfortunately, sometimes there are risks that come with using a water cooler and potential health risks involved.

Contaminated water is one of the biggest dangers associated with using a water cooler. If your water source is not treated properly, bacteria and other contaminants can make their way into the reservoir and into the tap. This can lead to serious illnesses such as diarrhea and vomiting if ingested. Additionally, if your water system isn't maintained properly or frequently cleaned out, it can also contain traces of heavy metals or chemicals that can be dangerous to ingest over time.

Another potential risk associated with using a water cooler is the growth of mold or mildew in the reservoir or pipes due to stagnant water that has been allowed to sit for too long. This could lead to breathing issues for people who are sensitive to mold spores and allergies. Additionally, some plastic containers used for storing drinking from a water cooler may also be contaminated with BPA (Bisphenol A), which is known to be an endocrine disruptor when ingested. 

In conclusion, although it can provide convenient access to drinking water in many places, there are certain risks associated with using a traditional standing-style body cooler unit that should not be overlooked in order for you stay healthy and safe while enjoying your fresh drinking source. It’s important that regular maintenance on both the interior components as well as replacing any plastic containers regularly are done in order keep everyone safe from any potential contamination or buildup of toxins over time, so make sure you check on these things regularly!
