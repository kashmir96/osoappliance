If your dryer isn’t drying clothes as effectively as it used to, you’re probably wondering why. Luckily, there are several potential causes that you can easily address yourself. 

One of the most common reasons a dryer isn’t drying clothes is that the lint filter is clogged with lint and other debris. A clogged filter can restrict airflow and reduce your dryer’s efficiency, so make sure to clean it out regularly. Even if you don’t see any visible build-up on the screen, it could still be blocked inside the filter housing. Cleaning the lint filter should take less than five minutes and can make a huge difference in performance. 

Another potential cause is a blocked vent or exhaust hose. This can be caused by a buildup of lint in the vent, or if something has become stuck in either end of the hose (like an animal or rodent). Make sure to inspect both ends of your exhaust hose for any blockages before running your dryer again. 

A third possible cause is often overlooked: an undersized dryer for its load size. If you are trying to dry more than 4-5 items at once, it may not be able to handle the load size efficiently — resulting in longer drying times and wetter clothes after each cycle is complete. Consider downsizing your loads if this might be causing problems with drying efficiency. 

Finally, make sure all settings are correct. If heat settings have been accidentally changed or switched off entirely, this could explain why your dryer isn’t getting hot enough to properly evaporate moisture from clothing fibers during each cycle — resulting in dampness after each use. 

 Dryers are essential appliances found in homes across Canada and around the world – helping people quickly and conveniently clean their laundry without wasting energy or time outside hanging their garments up on washing lines! They come in both gas-powered models as well as electric models depending on what energy source (if any) is available at home; they also come in different sizes from small compact units perfect for single people living alone right up through larger family-sized units capable of handling multiple loads simultaneously! Their benefits range from saving money on water bills compared to hand washing laundry through to providing convenience by not needing outdoor space for air drying clothes - instead making it easy to just turn them on whenever needed! Ultimately they provide a much faster way (often using steam features) for households everywhere efficient laundry cleaning solutions with minimal effort required!
