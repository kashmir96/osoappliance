Installing a washing machine in New Zealand is a relatively simple process that can be tackled by the homeowner with minimal tools and preparation. The following steps will help you to successfully install a washing machine in your home:

1. Prepare the area – Before beginning, make sure there is enough space for the new machine. Measure the door width and make sure your new machine will fit through it. Also ensure that drainage is available for the water to run out of – this could mean running some piping from an existing sink or connecting to a nearby drainpipe. 

2. Unpack – Carefully unpack your new washing machine and check it for any visible damage or irregularities before proceeding with installation.
 
3. Level – Place your washing machine on either a level surface or adjustable feet, depending on what type of machines are being installed, so that it can be levelled correctly during installation to ensure optimal performance and energy efficiency. 
 
4. Connections – Install water inlet valves (hot and cold) at both sides of the washer using pipes supplied by the manufacturer or local hardware store, then attach these to their respective pipes in your house using fittings provided (or purchased separately). Make sure all connections are firmly tightened before moving onto electrical connections if required by your model (if not, skip this step). Finally connect an earthed power cord from your house’s power outlet into the back of the washing machine in order to provide power supply when required during operation.. 

 5 Finishing touches - Ensure all connections have been made securely and double check all levels again if necessary before switching on and running through its first cycle! 

 Installing a washing machine can seem like an overwhelming task but following these steps should help you get started quickly and easily!
