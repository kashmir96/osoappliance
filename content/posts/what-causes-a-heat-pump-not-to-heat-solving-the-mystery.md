## Identifying the Culprit of a Heat Pump Failure

Are your toes chilly despite the fact that your heat pump is running? It can be a real chore to assess which among the many possible problems is at play when a heating system doesn't seem to be doing its job. It's even possible to purchase replacement parts when the issue isn't apparent. If you're not sure what's wrong, let's take a look at a few of the causes for a heat pump not heating.

### Compressor malfunction

The compressor of your heat pump is a vital component and requires electricity to run. If you notice that the motor is spreading an unpleasant smell, you may have a burnt-out motor. If the power to your pump cuts out for any reason, the compressor may require checking or replacing. Additionally, if your condensing coils are compromised, the compressor will not function properly and should be replaced.

### Insufficient refrigerant

Heat pumps are dependant on refrigerant in order to work properly. If your system is running low, it is not able to maintain the heat efficiently. A decrease in pressure could be an indication of a refrigerant leak in the system and must be handled immediately as addressed.

### Outdoor Unit Failure

An outdoor unit's fan is responsible for moving air and dissipating heat. If the fan fails to come on, you should investigate why. It's also possible that the thermostat itself needs to be replaced if it is not communicating correctly with the heat pump and outdoor unit.
