## Diagnosing and Resolving Bosch Washing Machine Error Code E36

If your Bosch washing machine is displaying error code E36, then you know it's important to take action quickly. This code indicates the appliance is unable to fill, in other words, the water supply is inadequate for the cycle your washer is currently attempting. To repair this error and have your washer up and running again, there are a few steps you can take. 

First, check the water inlet hose connected to the back of the machine - there needs to be adequate water pressure coming through. You may need to increase the taps or turn off an outside hose or other appliance, such as a dishwasher, which could be reducing the pressure leading to your washer. If everything looks in order here and on the faucets, then move onto the inlet valve itself. Over time it can become blocked with lint or sediment, reducing water pressure. Ensure all valves are screwed in tightly and all the lint or sediment is removed. 

Next, assess the drain hose. If the hose is slightly blocked, the water will be unable to reach the washer. Cleaning the drain hose should solve this - you can use a wire coat hanger, for example, to clear the blockage. 

If, after slowly going through these steps, your washer is still displaying error code E36, then it’s likely a more serious underlying issue at play. For this, contact a professional who is trained in Bosch washer repair.

With an understanding of the most common causes of error code E36 and the necessary steps to take in order to prevent and fix the issue, you’re well-equipped to keep your Bosch washing machine running smoothly and reliably.
