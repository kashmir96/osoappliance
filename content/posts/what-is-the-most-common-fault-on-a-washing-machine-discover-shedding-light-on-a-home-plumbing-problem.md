## Uncovering the Most Common Washing Machine Failure
Breaking down the issue of home plumbing can be an intimidating task, especially when it comes to washing machines. Whether it is an overly wet load of laundry or an entire appliance breakdown, homeowners will likely be left wondering what went wrong. In this blog post, we explore the most common failure in washing machines and how to identify the fault, so you can get your washing machine up and running again. 

The most common problem for washing machines is a clog of debris in the pump or pipe. This debris is usually washing detergent, hair, or lint that has built up, blocking the water flow and causing the machine to break down or leak. Even if your model of washing machine is designed to prevent such clogs, it is important to properly clean and maintain the machine, ideally checking on it at least once a month. Regular maintenance, like clearing out any lint or fabric softener from hoses and filters, can help ensure your machine functions correctly and keep any plumbing problems away. 

Though it is important to check for a clog in advance of running an appliance, one of the most effective diagnostics when it does come to fixing the issue is to look for the the error code. Washing machines, like other appliances, all use codes to explain the fault and, therefore, provide the correct course of action. Depending on the make and model of washing machine, there might be small differences between error codes, but generally they are quite similar. Consulting an appliance error code list and cross-referencing the number with the code will help diagnose and solve the problem.

The last step should be reaching out to a professional plumber and/or technician. Scheduling a visit with a local plumbing service or reviewing the appliance warranty and installation manual is certainly a good idea when dealing with a machine failure. If the clog seems too complex for a DIY fix, these professionals will have the knowledge needed to rapidly fix the issue, have your appliance back up and running. 

In conclusion, the most common fault with a washing machine is a clogging of debris, hair, or lint that has built up over time. All homeowners should practice preventative care and maintenance regularly to avoid any issues, and if in doubt, consult an expert to ensure any problem is quickly and properly taken care of.
