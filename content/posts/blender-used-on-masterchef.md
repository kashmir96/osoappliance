Blender is one of the most essential tools in the kitchen, and it’s a must-have item for MasterChef contestants. With its powerful motor and multiple speeds, a blender can quickly and efficiently puree, blend, chop and emulsify ingredients. On MasterChef, blenders are used to create sauces, soups and other dishes that require smooth textures.

For example, contestants often use blenders to make velvety smooth sauces like hollandaise or béarnaise. Blenders are also used to make vinaigrettes or marinades by combining oil and vinegar with herbs and spices. Blenders can also be used to make cream-based soups like broccoli cheddar or butternut squash soup without having to chop every single ingredient by hand. For making pesto or other thick sauces with nuts or cheese, a blender is ideal for creating an even texture without chunks.

In addition to blending ingredients together into a homogenous mix, some blenders also have settings that allow you to pulse foods for chunky consistency—perfect for making salsa or guacamole with pieces of tomatoes, onions and peppers instead of having them all blended into mush! Some blenders also come with special attachments that allow you to turn certain fruits into sorbet or frozen treats made with crushed ice. The possibilities are endless! 

To achieve the best results when using a blender on MasterChef (or at home!), it’s important not to overload it—don’t fill it more than two-thirds full—and always start out on the lowest speed setting first before turning up the power as needed. And don’t forget about safety—be sure to lock the lid onto your blender before turning it on so that no one gets injured from splashing food! 

On the show, the blender used is vitamix. It is a high-performance blender with a powerful motor that can handle the toughest ingredients, and its variable speed settings allow contestants to precisely control the texture of whatever they’re making.

Whether you’re a MasterChef contestant or an at-home cook, a blender is an incredibly versatile tool that can be used to make all sorts of delicious dishes!
