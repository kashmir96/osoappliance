When it comes to buying large appliances such as refrigerators, washers and dryers, consumers have many options. The best place to buy large appliances depends on a few factors, including budget, desired features and customer service. 

For budget-conscious shoppers looking for a good deal on an appliance, it may be best to shop online. Online retailers offer competitive prices and often have sales or promotions that can help save money. Additionally, online retailers usually offer a wider selection of models than brick-and-mortar stores so shoppers can find the exact model they want without having to settle for something less than ideal. 

However, if you’re looking for personalized advice when making your purchase decision or want detailed product information from someone knowledgeable in the field, then shopping at a local brick-and-mortar store is probably your best bet. Brick-and-mortar stores often provide more personalized customer service and can provide helpful advice when choosing between different models or features. Plus these stores often have sales staff that are trained in the products they sell so they can provide accurate information about product specs and features which may be difficult to glean from online sources alone. 

In short, it really depends on what kind of experience you’re looking for when buying large appliances – whether it’s convenience and price savings or personalized advice – but either way there are plenty of options available depending on your needs!
