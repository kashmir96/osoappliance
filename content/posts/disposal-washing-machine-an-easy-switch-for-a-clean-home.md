## FAQs for Disposal Washing Machines

**How do disposal washing machines work?** 
Disposal washing machines rely on built-in grinders to reduce larger pieces of waste and sediment into small particles before they are discharged through the drain pipe. Soft and decomposable waste is ground down into the sewer or septic tank where it is broken down naturally through the waste treatment process.

**What are the benefits of using a disposal washing machine?** 
Using a disposal washing machine can make laundry day easier and cleaner as it eliminates the need to manually scrape off remainders from the fabric fibers. Additionally, they increase the lifespan of the washing machine, as it eliminates potential damage caused by items clogging up the drainage system.

**Are there any downsides to disposal washing machines?** 
Although disposal washing machines are a great convenience, they are more expensive than typical washing machines, and require additional maintenance due to the built-in grinder. Furthermore, it is important that hard objects such as stones, pins, or coins are removed from the fabric before loading them into the washing machine, as they can cause damage to the grinder.

**What items should not be put in a disposal washing machine?** 
It is not recommended to wash heavily soiled items and items which contain hard objects such as coins or stones in a disposal washing machine. Additionally, items that contain oils, such as leather, should be left out of the disposal washing machine to protect the grinder.
