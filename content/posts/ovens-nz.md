Ovens are an essential appliance in a kitchen and are used to cook and bake all sorts of delicious meals. New Zealand is home to a range of different types of ovens, each designed to meet the needs of different cooks. Whether you’re looking for a basic electric oven or a top-of-the-line convection oven with features like steam cleaning, NZ has got you covered. 

Electric ovens are the most common type found in New Zealand kitchens. These come in both single and double models and feature either radiant (coil) or fan elements for efficient cooking. Electric ovens tend to be more affordable than other types, making them an ideal choice for those on a budget.

Convection ovens are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to evenly cook food with hot air circulation that prevents cold spots from forming. Unlike conventional electric models, convection models use fan-forced heat distribution to ensure even cooking throughout the entire cavity. Many models also feature steam cleaning capabilities which make it easy to keep your oven clean without using harsh chemical cleaners. 

Gas wall ovens offer great performance combined with traditional design features such as cast iron grills, hob rings and shelves that can be adjusted up or down depending on what you’re cooking. The main advantage of gas wall ovens is that they offer excellent temperature control allowing you to adjust the heat quickly and easily while maintaining consistent results throughout your cooking time. 

Steam ovens combine traditional convection heating with steam technology which allows food to be cooked faster while retaining up to 20% more nutrients than other methods such as boiling or steaming in pans over the stovetop. Steam walls are also ideal for baking cakes and pastries as they allow you to adjust the moisture levels for perfect results every time! 

 No matter what type of cooking style or budget best suits your needs, New Zealand has plenty of options when it comes to buying an oven that meets all your needs!
