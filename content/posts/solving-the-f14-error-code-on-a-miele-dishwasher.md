## Resolving the F14 Error Message on a Miele Dishwasher 
Few things are more frustrating than seeing an error code when you’re trying to make a dishwasher work. Getting an F14 error code on your Miele dishwasher means that the water is not draining properly. This is a fairly common problem, and with the right steps, it can be solved fairly easily. 

When attempting to troubleshoot, the first thing to do is determine the exact model of your Miele dishwasher and make sure that the owner’s manual is available. Each model may have various components involved and varying steps for repair. Make sure that all appropriate safety precautions and warnings on the unit are followed.

When this error message appears, it means that some type of debris or an item has gotten lodged in the drain hose. To ensure that it’s cleared, owners should locate and disconnect the hose from the sink and check that it is open. If the problem persists, and the owner does not find any debris in the backflow preventer, then the hose may need to be cleaned or replaced. 

If the issue is not related to the hose, then the fault could lie in the motor or the contaminated pump. Those with basic knowledge of plumbing should be able to determine if this is the case and if they should replace any parts. If not, then a professional service technician should be contacted.

In conclusion, the F14 error code on Miele dishwashers can be caused by a blockage in the drain hose. It is plugging the dishwasher from emptying. If the blockage can be identified and removed, this should resolve the issue. If not, the motor or pump may need to be adjusted or replaced. In either case, it is recommended to contact a professional [appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for assistance.
