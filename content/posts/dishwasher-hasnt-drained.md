If your dishwasher isn’t draining properly, it can be a real headache. Not only does it leave your dishes dirty, but it can also lead to a smelly dishwasher and even damage to the appliance itself. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue and get your dishwasher draining properly again.

The first step is to check the drain hose. Make sure it’s securely attached to the dishwasher and the sink drain. If it’s loose, tighten it. You should also check for any kinks or bends in the hose. If there are any, straighten them out.

Next, check the drain filter. The filter is usually located in the bottom of the dishwasher and can become clogged with food particles, soap scum, and other debris. If the filter is clogged, it can restrict the flow of water and prevent the dishwasher from draining properly. Clean the filter with a brush and rinse it thoroughly.

If the drain hose and filter are in good condition, the next step is to check the drain pump. The pump is responsible for pushing water out of the dishwasher and can become clogged with debris. If it’s clogged, it won’t be able to push the water out. To check the pump, disconnect the power and remove the cover. Use a brush to clean out any debris from the pump and reassemble the dishwasher.

If the drain pump is in good condition, the last step is to check the drain valve. The valve is responsible for controlling the flow of water out of the dishwasher. It can become stuck or jammed, preventing the water from draining properly. To check the valve, disconnect the power and remove the cover. Use a brush to clean out any debris from the valve and reassemble the dishwasher.

If you’ve followed all of these steps but your dishwasher still isn’t draining properly, it’s likely a sign of a more serious problem and you may need to call a professional.
