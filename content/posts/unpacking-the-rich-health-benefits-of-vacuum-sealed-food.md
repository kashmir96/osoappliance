## Unravelling the Rewards of Vacuum Packed Food

Preserving food has been a cornerstone of human civilizations to assist with food security and availability over time. Recent advances in refrigeration technology and vacuuming have given way to new and improved ways of preserving food while still maintaining its health-promoting benefits. In this blog post, we will unpack the many rich health benefits of vacuum sealed food that makes it such a popular choice for related households and users of household appliances.

Vacuum packed food is a great choice for health-conscious consumers looking to extend the shelf life of their food while still preserving its nutritional benefits. Vacuuming works by evacuating the air inside the sealed container, which helps prevent air-borne bacteria or contaminants from making contact with the food which can spoil it or make it unsafe to eat. This process preserves the delicate nutritional components of food such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are essential for promoting health and wellbeing. In addition, since the air inside the container is removed, the food takes up less space, which can come in handy if you have limited storage space.

The process of vacuum packing is a simple one and the equipment needed is not too costly. Additionally, it is non-toxic and chemical-free, so you can be sure that your food is being preserved safely. Vacuuming also helps to preserve the quality and flavour of the food and minimises the number of spoilage-causing microorganisms. This means that foods can stay virtually untouched and retain their nutritious values for much longer.

Finally, vacuum-packed food requires less energy to store than other methods of food preservation, such as canning or freezing, making it a very energy-efficient and eco-friendly choice. Plus, it eliminates the need, in some cases, to store food in a refrigerator, or else use expensive electric heaters, thereby helping to reduce your energy bills.

With all these health and environmental benefits, it is easy to see why vacuuming has become so popular among consumers. To take full advantage of the perks of having vacuum sealed food in your home, it is essential to have an appliance that does the job correctly and the right repairs when something is not functioning correctly.

## Uncover the Rich Health Benefits of Vacuum Sealed Food

1. What are the nutritional benefits of vacuum sealed food? 

Vacuum sealed food preserves more of its original nutritional value, compared to food stored in more traditional methods. Vacuum sealing removes air, which prevents oxidation and slows down nutrient depletion that is otherwise caused by air and light exposure. This keeps food fresher for longer, and helps retain much more of its nutritional value. 

2. Is vacuum sealed food healthier than non-vacuum sealed food? 

Vacuum sealed food is usually healthier than non-vacuum sealed food because it preserves more of its original vitamins and antioxidants, many of which are lost to spoilage and time otherwise. Vacuum sealing also eliminates the need for artificial preservatives, which can often be unhealthy. 

3. What types of food can be vacuum sealed? 

Almost any type of food can be vacuum sealed. This includes fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, nuts, and meats. Even shelf-stable items like grains, cereal, and dried fruits can also be vacuum sealed. 

4. What foods should not be vacuum sealed? 

Some foods, such as fresh bread, fried foods, and chips should not be vacuum sealed because they contain too much moisture and fat content that can cause degradation. Certain soft or crunchy fruits or vegetables can also be damaged if vacuum sealed for too long. 

5. How long does vacuum sealed food last? 

The shelf life of vacuum sealed food is usually much longer than traditional food packaging. Depending on the type of food and how it is stored, most vacuum sealed items can last anywhere from two weeks to up to a year or longer.
