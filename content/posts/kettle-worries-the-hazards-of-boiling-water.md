## Evaluating the Hazards of Home Kettle Usage
When using a kettle to boil water in most homes around the world, there are often a few things forgotten. It's important to not just be aware of the safety risks associated with these types of appliances but also take precautions to protect yourself and your loved ones when using them. 

One of the most common hazards when using a kettle is the risk of scalding. As the boiling water reaches temperatures as high as 120°C, it can cause severe burns if it comes into contact with skin. It’s also important to be mindful of how quickly the boiling water can cause surface damage. Be sure to utilize a potholder if handling your kettle, and always pour the hot water away from any surfaces that could be damaged by heat.

Though less likely, it is possible for a kettle to explode due to an improper seal or overfilled tank. These explosions can cause severe harm to the user, as well as fire and water damage to the home. It’s important to inspect your kettle often, and be sure not to fill it past the maximum line.

In order to reduce the risks associated with boiling water in a kettle it is also important to utilize overheat protection. Many of the newer models of kettles come with this setting included and can be switched on. This will ensure that the heat is cut off if the water reaches a temperature too hot for safe consumption.

When using a kettle to boil water, it is important to remain aware of the potential hazards. Proper ventilation, keeping the kettle clean and dry, inspecting it for any signs of damage, and utilizing overheat protection are all effective ways to ensure safety while using an electric kettle.

Appliances play a major role in our daily lives, but it's important to be aware of the risks associated with their use.
