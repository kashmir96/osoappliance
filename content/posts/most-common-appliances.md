Appliances are essential to everyday life. From refrigerators and ovens to washing machines and dryers, they make our lives easier and more comfortable. But with so many different types of appliances, it can be hard to know which ones are the most common. Here, we’ll take a look at the most common appliances found in homes today.

The refrigerator is likely the most important appliance in any home. Not only does it keep food cold and prevent spoilage, but it also provides a convenient place for storing food and drinks. Some people even use their refrigerator for additional storage space for things like condiments, sauces, and jams. Refrigerators come in a variety of sizes and styles, from top-freezers to side-by-side models with built-in ice makers. Many models now even come with features like temperature controls and adjustable shelves that make food storage even easier.

The oven is another essential appliance in any kitchen. Ovens are used to cook everything from casseroles to cakes and cookies, as well as bake meats like chicken or pork chops. While gas ovens were once the standard, electric models have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their convenience features such as preheat settings that allow you to begin cooking right away without waiting for the oven to heat up first.

Washing machines are another must-have appliance found in nearly every household today. These machines take some of the tedium out of doing laundry by providing an easy way to clean clothes without having to scrub them by hand or hang them out on a line for drying afterward. Many modern washers now come with multiple settings that allow you customize your laundry experience depending on fabric type or load size; plus they save time by using less water than traditional methods of washing clothes do!

Dryers go hand-in-hand with washing machines; they’re used for drying clothes after they’ve been washed so that you don’t have to hang them up outside or wait hours for them air dry indoors before putting them away again. Dryers come in several different varieties including gas dryers that use natural gas as fuel source and electric dryers that run off electricity (which can be more energy efficient). Some even come equipped with features like moisture sensors so you don’t have worry about over-drying your clothes! 

Finally, dishwashers are also becoming increasingly popular amongst households these days because they provide an effortless way of cleaning dishes without having scrub them by hand yourself – plus they save time since all you have do is load up your dirty dishes into the machine before pressing start! Dishwashers often come with multiple settings so you can customize how clean your dishes get according each load size or dirtiness level; some newer models even feature third racks specifically designed holding silverware upright during cycles! 

 All these appliances combined make life much easier – no matter what kind of home you live in! Whether it's a small apartment or large house – having access these common appliances can help reduce stress levels time spent on mundane everyday tasks like cleaning dishes doing laundry so we spend more quality time friends family members instead!
