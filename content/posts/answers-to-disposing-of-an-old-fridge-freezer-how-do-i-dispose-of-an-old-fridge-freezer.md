## Disposing of an Old Fridge Freezer
Even if you’re in the market for a new fridge or freezer, you still have to consider how to safely dispose of your old appliance. It’s a good idea to learn more about what’s involved in proper disposal before making a purchase, so you have a plan for when it’s time to upgrade.

Before you dispose of your fridge or freezer, take time to properly prepare it for disposal. This includes disposing of the refrigerant and cleaning out residue from the interior. If you don’t clean out the interior, the residue might contaminate landfills and cause harm to the environment. 

If you don’t have the skills to do these tasks safely, you can hire a certified technician to do them for you. The technician can also tell you which local laws apply to you and make sure you’re disposing of the appliance legally. 

You can also check with local charities to see if they’re willing to take in your old appliance, or test to see if it still works. 

If your old appliance is beyond saving, or if you don’t have any luck finding someone willing to take it, you can look into taking it to your local landfill or recycling center. You’ll likely have to pay a fee to leave it there, but you’ll be helping the environment in the process. 

It’s important to take steps to properly dispose of your old fridge and freezer, both for the safety of the environment and for the health of yourself and your family. Researching these steps carefully before disposing of your appliance can save you time, energy, and money in the long run.
