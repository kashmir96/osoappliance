## Troubleshooting a Faulty Air-Conditioner Fan Motor 

When the summer months come around, we rely on our air conditioners to keep us cool and comfortable in our homes. Unfortunately, sometimes these appliances encounter issues due to general wear and tear, and the fan motor can be affected. In this blog, we'll take a look inside at what to look out for when fixing a broken fan motor in air conditioner units.

The air conditioner's fan motor is an important component as it is responsible for blowing the air through the vents and out into the room. Depending on the issue, a mechanic may need to open up the air conditioner and take a look inside. This could include inspecting the fan blades to make sure they aren't bent or damaged, as these can cause the motor to overheat and possibly break. The fan motor itself might need to be taken out, tested and replaced. 

In addition to the fan motor, any other electrical components like the wiring and capacitors may have been damaged due to the motor failing. These should be checked and replaced if necessary. It is also important to make sure that the air conditioner's filters are regularly cleaned â€“ dirt and dust buildup can clog the air filter, reducing the efficiency of the air-conditioner and placing extra strain on the motor.

If you suspect your fan motor is at fault and you're not comfortable inspecting and replacing it yourself, it's important to call a qualified appliance technician for assistance. They'll be able to identify the exact cause of the fault and make the necessary repairs. 

Fixing a broken fan motor in air-conditioners can be tricky, but with the help of a professional appliance repair technician it can be done quickly and safely.
