## Stress-free Whiteware Removal in Kapiti - What You Need to Know
When it comes to disposing of white goods in Kapiti, it is important to be aware of the potential stress and complications that can arise. With the right know-how and a few simple tips, you can make the process of removing your unwanted appliances much easier.

For starters, there are several things you'll need to do before any white goods are put out for collection. Firstly, all white goods must be empty and free of any remaining food or liquid residues. You must also ensure that all the doors have been removed and the connections have been disconnected or the power has been shut off.

Once these steps are complete, you'll need to make sure your white goods are properly labelled for collection. Kapiti District Council requires that all white goods be labelled with a ‘White Goods Collection’ tag, which can be purchased from participating retailers. This label ensures that Council is aware that the items are ready to be collected, making it easier for them to locate your items when they are ready for removal. 

Once your items have been labelled, it is important to note that Kapiti District Council will only collect up to two white goods per month. Depending on the size of your appliance collection, this may mean that some items may need to be stored until they can be collected. It can be helpful to find a dry, private location with good ventilation in which to store them.

Finally, it is important to be aware of any fees associated with white goods collection from your local Council. Depending on your specific circumstances, there may be additional charges for larger collections or collections of hazardous chemicals.

Removing white goods from your home can be a daunting process, but with a little bit of knowledge, it doesn't have to be.
