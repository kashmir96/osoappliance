An oven mitt is an essential kitchen item used to protect your hands when handling hot items. Whether you're taking a baking dish or tray out of the oven, transferring food from a hot pan to a plate, or even just reaching into the oven to adjust something, an oven mitt is a must-have. Oven mitts are designed to be heat-resistant and offer excellent protection for your hands. 

The most common type of oven mitt available in New Zealand is made from cotton fabric with some form of heat-resistant material inside (often wool). This material can withstand temperatures up to 200 degrees Celsius, making it perfect for protecting your hands when handling hot items. Oven mitts usually come in pairs and feature long sleeves that reach up past your wrist for added protection. 

When selecting an oven mitt, it's important to choose one that fits properly and offers adequate coverage for the job you'll be doing. You should also make sure that the seams are well stitched so that there's no risk of heat escaping through them. Additionally, look for a design with non-slip grips on the palm and fingers so that you can get a secure hold on whatever you're carrying without fear of dropping it. 

Finally, take care to look after your oven mitts properly - they should be washed regularly in warm water and hung out to dry after each use. This will ensure they last as long as possible and provide maximum protection while youâ€™re using them in the kitchen!
