## Overloading a Dryer Creates Fire Danger

Overloading a dryer is a common household mistake, but it can be extremely hazardous. As clothes tumble around, the dryer can easily overheat, sparking a serious fire if proper precautions are not taken. Knowing the dangers and how to avoid them is crucial for anyone who owns or operates a dryer. 

Clothing and other fabric items contain oils and dyes that can ignite when heated in dryers. This means that when lint accumulates in the dryer, it can create a dangerous fire hazard since it’s highly flammable. Clothes that are too big or too thick can create too much strain on the motor and overheating, although there should be an over-load protection switch inside the dryer. The electrical wiring can be damaged as well if the machine is overworked, leading to dangerous shorts and sparking. 

To ensure safety, it’s important to clean out the lint trap after every use. Lint buildup can make it difficult for the dryer to dry clothes, and can be highly flammable. It’s also important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions on how to properly load the dryer, and make sure not to overload it. It is also important to have an annual inspection by a professional so they can check for any potential issues.

By following these tips, you can protect yourself and your family from potential dryer fires.
