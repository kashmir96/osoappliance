## Enjoy Effortless Laundry Days with the Wash-Connect App
Tired of ending wash days with piles of wet laundry? Make your wash day a whole lot easier with the Wash-Connect App. This app makes it easier than ever to manage your washing machine.

Whether you’re at home or on the go, the Wash-Connect App gives you access to your washing machine anytime, anywhere. With the app, you’re able to start or pause washes, check the estimated end time of a cycle and be alerted when it’s finished. In addition, the app lets you adjust settings, such as selecting a different spin speed or adjusting temperatures, and get access to recommended wash cycles – giving you the perfect wash every time. 

The app also helps you to save energy. When you’re away, you can delay your wash cycle until later in the day and avoid peak energy consumption periods, or adjust the cycle to save time and money on your energy bill. And if you have a smart home, you can connect the app to your other appliances. This makes it easier to turn on the dishwasher and dryer and air dry your clothes in just one click. 

The Wash-Connect App is designed to give you the perfect wash day with minimal effort. Get started and enjoy effortless laundry days with the Wash-Connect App. Check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to find the perfect washing machine for your needs.
