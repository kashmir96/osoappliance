## Unlocking the Meaning Behind Universal Laundry Symbols 

Universal laundry symbols are pictorial guides used to provide instructions on how to care for your garments. The symbols may look like hieroglyphics, so understanding and correctly interpreting them can be tricky at times. This guide will help decode the symbols so you can properly care for your fabrics and keep your garments looking as good as new for longer. 

The global laundry symbols used today are based on a categorization system developed by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Care Labelling International Organisation (CINET). The symbols use colors, lines, and words along with images to convey the exact instructions for laundry care for each fabric. 

The blue section of each symbol provides information about washing care, such as which type of wash cycle is recommended, what temperature setting to use and how much detergent or softener you should use. The circle indicates what type of wash cycle and temperature setting should be used, and the semi-circle shape might have the letters ‘W’ or ‘P’ which indicates whether it is recommended to be hand or machine washed. 

The second section of the laundry symbol — the red — provides instructions for drying and ironing of fabrics. The triangle indicates if tumble drying, air drying or no drying should be done. The circle inside the triangle shows the temperature recommended for tumble drying and ironing, with a higher number indicating a higher temperature. The options, No iron, Cool iron or Hot iron, are indicated by a symbol in the middle of the triangle.

The final section — the green — provides information about professional treatments, such as bleaching and dry-cleaning. A ‘P’ inside the green circle tells you the item should not be bleached. A ‘D’ indicates that the clothing requires dry-cleaning, and a cross in the circle shows the item cannot be dry-cleaned. 

It's important to remember that these symbols are only a general guide and should be considered with other information provided by the garment manufacturer. Having a good understanding of the universal laundry symbols and how to interpret them is key to properly caring for your clothing and other garments.
