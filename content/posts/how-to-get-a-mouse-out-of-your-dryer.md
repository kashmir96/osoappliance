If you’ve ever found a mouse in your dryer, you know it can be a stressful situation. Not only is it unpleasant, but it can also be dangerous if the mouse gets stuck in the dryer’s motor or other parts. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to safely remove a mouse from your dryer.

1. Shut Off the Dryer: The first step is to shut off the dryer and unplug it from the wall. This will prevent the mouse from being injured by the dryer’s motor or other parts.

2. Find the Mouse: Next, you should locate the mouse. It’s likely hiding in a dark corner or crevice of the dryer. If you can’t find it, try turning on a flashlight and shining it into the dryer.

3. Create a Path to the Door: Once you’ve located the mouse, you’ll need to create a path to the door. This can be done by using a broom or other long-handled tool to gently push the mouse towards the door.

4. Open the Door: Finally, open the door of the dryer and let the mouse out. It’s important to be patient and gentle as you do this, as the mouse may be scared and could try to run away.

5. If the mouse has found its way into the casing of the machine, you may need to remove the back or top using the screws on the back and gently pry a space. If this is the case, you might be better off leaving a trap or cheese nearby to coax the mouse out in its own time, as getting in and amongst electronics is a dangerous game to play. 

By following these steps, you can safely remove a mouse from your dryer. It’s important to remember that mice can carry diseases, so it’s best to wear gloves when handling them. Additionally, you should call a professional if the mouse is stuck in the dryer’s motor or other parts.
