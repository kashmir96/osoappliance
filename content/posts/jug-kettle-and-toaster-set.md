As anyone who has ever done a spot of international travel will tell you, the differences in culture and customs between different countries can be quite striking. This is especially true when it comes to the use of kitchen appliances such as kettles. In the UK, jug kettles are a common sight in most households, while they are relatively rare in the US.

In Britain, jug kettles are usually electric and have a spout for pouring boiling water into a cup or mug. They tend to boil quickly as they heat up water directly rather than heating it by immersing it in hot water like some other types of kettles do. Jug kettles have been popular in Britain since the 1950s and remain so today due to their convenience, affordability, and ease of use. 

In contrast, jug kettles are less common in the US. This is likely because Americans tend to prefer stovetop designs that heat water by immersing it in hot water rather than directly heating it with an electric element like jug kettles do. Stovetop designs also often increase capacity by allowing additional amounts of water to be boiled simultaneously without having to wait for each batch to finish before another one can start – something that's not possible with an electric kettle like a jug kettle. Additionally, many Americans prefer stovetop designs because they feel they give them more control over how their hot beverages taste by allowing them to adjust temperatures more precisely than with an electric kettle which tends to have limited settings available for temperature control. 

Although jug kettles may be less common in America than they are across the pond, there is still a market for them Stateside as evidenced by their availability at many stores such as Walmart and Target. Whether you’re looking for convenience or precision when making your morning cup of tea or coffee – there’s a kettle out there that’s right for you!
