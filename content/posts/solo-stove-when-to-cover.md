If you’re looking for a way to cook outdoors without the hassle of an open fire, then a Solo Stove is the perfect solution. The Solo Stove is a lightweight, compact stove designed to provide efficient outdoor cooking with minimal smoke and ash. It’s easy to use, and it’s ideal for camping trips or cooking at home in your backyard.

So when should you cover your Solo Stove? The answer depends on how you plan to use it. If you’re using it for camping trips, then you should always cover it when not in use. This will keep out dirt, dust, and debris that can clog up the air vents and reduce efficiency. It also helps protect the stove from the elements and makes it easier to transport.

If you’re using your Solo Stove at home in your backyard, then you don’t necessarily need to cover it when not in use. However, if you live in an area that experiences heavy rain or snowfall, then it’s a good idea to cover your Solo Stove to protect it from the elements. You can also cover your Solo Stove if you plan on storing it for an extended period of time (such as during the winter months). This will help keep out dirt and dust that can build up over time and reduce efficiency.

No matter how you plan on using your Solo Stove, always make sure that it is covered when not in use to ensure maximum performance and longevity.
