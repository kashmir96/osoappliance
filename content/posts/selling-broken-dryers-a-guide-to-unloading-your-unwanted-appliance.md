## Selling a Broken Dryer: Getting Rid of Unwanted Appliances
Do you need to get rid of an old or broken dryer? You might not know where it begin or how to best go about doing it. Here is a guide to help you through the process of selling broken dryers, so you can find the best solution for your situation.

Once you’ve decided it’s time to unload your broken dryer, the first step is to determine the condition of the appliance. If the dryer is in a decent, functional condition, you’ll likely be able to find someone willing to take it off of your hands. If it’s really beyond repair, you’ll likely want to recycle the dryer. Call a local recycling center to find the best way to go about this.

The next option for getting rid of your unwanted appliance is to turn it into scrap metal. You can find a junk or scrap yard in your city to help you do this. A scrap yard will take apart the dryer and separate it into metal, plastic, and other materials, and then you will receive a payment in return. Depending on the materials, you could earn around $0.10 per pound on the metal.

For dryers in working condition or fair condition, your next option is to list it on a marketplace or classifieds website. Be sure to include a thorough description of the appliance, along with a handful of good photos of the dryer in and out of the box. You could also reach out to appliance repair shops in your area. They may be interested in purchasing the dryer from you to use for parts or to be repaired and resold.

Selling broken dryers can seem intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be! By researching your options, you’ll be able to determine the best path for you.
