If you’re looking to get your electrical appliances squeaky clean, then you’ve come to the right place. Cleaning electrical appliances can be a bit intimidating, but with the right tools and supplies, it doesn’t have to be. Here are some tips on how to clean electrical appliances safely and effectively.

Start by unplugging the appliance from any power outlets. This is important for safety reasons as you don’t want to risk any electric shocks or damage to the appliance while cleaning it. Then, using a damp cloth or sponge, wipe away any dirt and dust from the surface of the appliance. For tougher stains or grime, try using a mild detergent solution and scrubbing lightly with a soft brush. Make sure that you rinse off all soap residue before drying with a paper towel or cloth.

When cleaning inside an electrical appliance such as an oven or microwave, use caution when reaching into tight spots and crevices. Use safe cleaning products such as baking soda mixed with water for stubborn spots and clean these areas carefully without damaging any components within the appliance itself. Additionally, if there are metal parts on your appliance that require polishing (such as range hoods), use metal polishes specifically designed for this purpose in order to avoid damaging them in the process of cleaning them up. 

Finally, thoroughly dry off all surfaces after cleaning so that no moisture remains inside your electric appliances which could lead to damage down the line due to short circuits caused by moisture buildup in sensitive components of your device's circuitry!
