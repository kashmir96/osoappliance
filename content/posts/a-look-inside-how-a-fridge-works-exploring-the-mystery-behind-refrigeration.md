## Inside the Mystery of Refrigeration
From our kitchens to industrial applications, the refrigerator plays an indispensable role in many homes and businesses. It may surprise the average homeowner to peel back the layers of mysterious technology and power that a refrigerator uses to keep foods cold and safe. Continue reading to learn more about the basics of fridge function and how refrigeration works.

At its most basic level, a refrigerator works by using a compressor and a cooling gas, most commonly Freon. The compressor drives the coolant into pipes containing evaporator coils in the back of the refrigerator. As the gas dissipates through the tubes, heat is taken away from the apparatus and the evaporator coils. Heat then radiates outside of the coils and is released into the environment. This method of cooling is the same that refrigerators and air conditioners use, the difference being the size and power of the engine. 

Next, the cooled air is sent back through the coils and circulates throughout the fridge. During this process, the temperature in the refrigerator is stronger and overpowers the heat from outside the fridge. This rapidly cools the foods or liquids stored in the refrigerator and keeps them at safe and preserved temperatures. As a result, bacteria and decay are significantly slowed, allowing you to easily store food for longer periods of time. 

The cycle of refrigeration is continuously repeated to preserve the foods inside the refrigerator. Now, with the basic understanding of how a refrigerator works, consumers can make more informed decisions when selecting a refrigerator and make sure they have the most efficient and effective appliance. 

Refrigerators play an important role in our everyday lives. Whether you are using a refrigerator to store food, medicines, or chemicals, being able to trust that appropriate temperature is maintained. The knowledge of how a refrigerator works will ensure that you are using the right device for the right application and ensure that your belongings stay safe and preserved.
