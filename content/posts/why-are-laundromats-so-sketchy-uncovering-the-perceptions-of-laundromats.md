## Uncovering the Stigma of Laundromats
From the fluorescent lighting to the eye-catching fluorescent walls, most laundromats are viewed as run-down and sketchy by many. Though it may seem like just a part of the past, there is more to the perception of laundromats than meets the eye. It is important to understand why laundromats are viewed in such an unfavorable light in order to dispel any preconceived notions associated with them. 

One of the primary reasons laundromats may be perceived as sketchy is the lack of privacy they offer. Unlike doing laundry in the privacy of one’s own home, laundromats are enclosed public spaces. People are often exposed to other people’s conversations, and personal items are left unattended in an environment where anyone may take them. This leaves many people feeling vulnerable and uncomfortable, especially those who may already be wary of public spaces.

In addition to privacy concerns, dirty, smelly, and broken-down machines can be a major deterrent for those attempting to do their laundry. Without regular maintenance, machines can suffer from a buildup of lint and other debris, leaving them confined to the run-down visions that some have of laundromats. This alone does little help to dispel the unfavorable views of laundromats.

Aside from the fear of theft or broken-down machines, the cost of doing laundry at a laundromat may be another factor in why it is seen as sketchy. It is important for owners to keep their prices low enough to remain competitive, but high enough to make a profit. As a result, many people feel that prices are too high, further perpetuating the negative perceptions of laundromats.

Though laundromats are often seen as sketchy and unpleasant places, there are ways to make them a more desirable and comfortable environment. Owners can take steps to ensure that machines are well-maintained, prices are fair, and safety concerns are addressed. Additionally, it is essential for customers to do their part by reporting any suspicious behavior to staff, being mindful of the items they leave unattended, and wearing personal protective items such as gloves and masks.

Overall, it is important to realize that the unsubstantiated perceptions of laundromats are many times culturally and contextually based. Though some people may find laundromats to be sketchy, many people are able and willing to do their laundry there with little to no issues. Knowing this, it is important to dispel any preconceived notions and evaluate laundromats and the services they offer on a case by case basis.
