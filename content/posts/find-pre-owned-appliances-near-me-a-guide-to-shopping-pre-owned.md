## Shopping for Pre-Owned Appliances

Pre-owned household appliances allow budget-minded consumers the chance to get a quality appliance on a budget. Purchasing pre-owned appliances can help individuals save money, reduce their carbon footprint, and waste less. There are many different ways to shop for pre-owned appliances and this guide can help you find what works best for your needs.

When looking for pre-owned appliances, there are several places to look. The first place to start is with your local appliance store. Many stores will have a section dedicated to pre-owned items that have been inspected and come with a warranty. Additionally, stores often purchase pre-owned items direct from customers who have replaced their old appliances with a new one. If you can't find what you're looking for at a local store, you can easily check out classifieds and online marketplace sites such as eBay and Craigslist. 

Another option for finding pre-owned appliances near you is to shop at an auction. There are many different types of auction houses and it's important to research and find the best one for your needs. Most auction houses will offer appliances that have been de-installed from the current residence and in some cases, you can even attend to inspect the item before bidding.

It's also important to consider the condition of the appliance when shopping for pre-owned items. While an appliance in good condition may cost more than one that is not, it could save you money in the long run by providing you with many years of reliable service. Be sure to ask the seller questions about the condition and performance of the item and always read the full description before making a purchase.

When shopping for pre-owned appliances, it's important to ensure you can have them serviced if a problem arises.
