## Investigating Fault Code E03 on Washing Machines
Household appliances such as washing machines can suffer problems, often indicated through an error code. One of these codes is E03, which can be confusing as to what the problem is. Therefore, it is important to investigate what potential issues could be causing this fault code.

When fault code E03 appears on a washing machine, this can indicate a water supply issue. This can be due to either the water not entering the washing machine correctly, or the pressure of the water not being substantial enough to allow the washing machine to operate properly. Therefore, if your washing machine is displaying E03 as a fault code, check that the water supply valve, which supplies the water from the pipe to the appliance, is turned on, and also check the tap is on. Furthermore, check to make sure that the water pressure is sufficient for the washing machine to essentially ‘suck’ in the water when the wash cycle is started.

If the water supply and pressure are both good, then fault code E03 has likely been caused by the drainage of the water not being successful or efficient. Therefore, test this by unplugging the washing machine and run a cycle. Wait around five minutes and then remove the plug and drain the water. If the cycle does not complete then examine the pump/motor, dispensers and hoses for blockages. Also check the drainage hose to make sure that it is placed correctly and is not blocked.

In conclusion, if fault code E03 appears on a washing machine, it is most likely caused by an issue with the water supply, the pressure or the drainage. Indeed, it is important to investigate this fault code and ensure the water supply, pressure and drainage are in order.
