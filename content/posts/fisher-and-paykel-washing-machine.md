Fisher & Paykel is a household name when it comes to washing machines. With their long history dating back to 1934, this New Zealand-based company has been producing high-quality washing machines for over 80 years. Today, Fisher & Paykel remains one of the most trusted brands in the appliance industry and continues to innovate with modern technology and features.

In the 1930s, Fisher & Paykel started out as a small appliance repair business based in Dunedin, New Zealand. It quickly expanded into manufacturing appliances such as refrigerators, stoves and washing machines. The company was one of the first to manufacture automated washing machines that used an agitator for cleaning clothes instead of manual scrubbing. This made them a much more efficient choice for busy households. 

Since then, Fisher & Paykel has continued to develop its products and improve upon its designs over time. In 2021, they introduced innovative features like SmartDrive™ Technology which mimics the human hand’s natural movement during agitation for better cleaning results and gentler fabric care. Additionally, ActiveIntelligence™ Technology recognizes the size of your load and adjusts water levels accordingly so you use only what you need while cleaning effectively every time. 

By 2023, Fisher & Paykel will have further advanced their technology even further with new advancements like AI-powered laundry recognition that can recognize different fabrics types so you never have to guess which cycle your clothes need ever again! You can also expect large touchscreen displays with intuitive controls where you can access helpful tutorials or troubleshoot any issues quickly right on your machine’s screen! 

Fisher & Paykel washing machines remain some of the most reliable on the market today thanks to their long history of quality craftsmanship and dedication to innovation within their products over time. With all these new features available in 2023 you’ll be sure find a machine that fits your needs perfectly!
