## Keeping Your Toaster Oven Fresh and Clean
It's no surprise that toaster ovens require routine maintenance to stay in optimal condition. Finding the right cleaning routine for your toaster oven can leave you with a fresh and spotless appliance. Here are five tips for making your toaster oven cleaning a breeze. 

### Unplug Your Toaster Oven
Safety first! Before you begin any cleaning process, make sure to unplug your toaster oven. Not only is this a safety precaution, but it also helps to prevent any water damage.

### Fill the Toaster Oven With Soapy Water
Once your toaster oven is unplugged, fill up the two trays with warm, soapy water. Prepare them in the sink and let them sit for a few hours or overnight to allow any buildup of grease or food particles to loosen and be easier to remove.

### Use Baking Soda as a Scrub
Baking soda is a great solution for cleaning tough stains in your toaster oven. Make a paste of baking soda and water, and then work on the oven’s surfaces with a scrub brush or cloth. Baking soda is a non-abrasive cleaner, so it won’t scratch the surface or leave any streaks or scratches behind.

### Clean the Coils and Heating Elements
Don’t forget to clean the heating elements and any coils that may be inside your toaster oven, as they can attract grease and other debris over time. Use an old toothbrush, damp cloth, or a soft brush to loosen and remove these deposits.

### Wipe the Toaster Oven
Once the hard-to-reach spots in your toaster oven are cleaned, you can use a damp cloth to wipe down the interior. This removes any dirt, grease, and food particles that might have built up inside your toaster oven while you were cleaning it.

Cleaning your toaster oven can seem intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be if you know the proper steps to take. The five tips outlined above will help you keep your toaster oven fresh and clean.
