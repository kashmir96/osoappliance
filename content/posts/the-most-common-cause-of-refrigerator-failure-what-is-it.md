## Investigating the Leading Cause of Refrigerator Malfunctions 

As one of our most relied upon household appliances, it’s essential to know what issues our refrigerators may encounter and how to head them off at the pass. After all, your family needs quality food and you don’t have time to wait for a costly repair service. The most common cause of refrigerator failure is related to basic use. 

If you’re wondering why your current refrigerator is malfunctioning, you should first consider the basics of regular use and maintenance. Investing the time to clean out the coils and change the water filter helps you get the most out of your refrigerator. This can help you avoid costly replacements and repairs. 

But, perhaps the most common cause of refrigerator breakdowns is improper ventilation. This can lead to peteformation and compressor failure, so keeping the area around your fridge clear from clutter and debris helps ensure that the appliance has plenty of ventilation. Hot spots can quickly result in your refrigerator losing efficiency and eventually failing - which means you’re likely going to need to pay for an expensive repair service. 

Another common cause of refrigerator failure is related to its positioning. If you're storing your fridge in a garage or in direct sunlight, you’re likely to run into issues. This is due to the fact that sudden fluctuations in temperature can damage the fridge and its parts. 

When it comes to the most common causes of refrigerator failure, it’s important to look at how you’re using and caring for the appliance. Regular cleaning and maintenance coupled with proper positioning and ventilation can go a long way towards helping your fridge remain in efficient working order.
