When it comes to purchasing a microwave oven, size should be one of the top considerations. A bigger microwave oven means more space for larger dishes and food items, as well as more power for faster cooking times. But not everyone has the same kitchen space or budget for a large microwave oven, so you need to make sure that you get the best bang for your buck when shopping around.

The best and biggest microwave ovens are typically those that offer a combination of features such as convection cooking, sensors to adjust power levels, and auto-cooking settings. They also come with larger interior capacities so that they can easily accommodate larger dishes and food items. In addition, many of these models feature more powerful wattages than their smaller counterparts making them perfect for heating up large meals quickly. 

Another important factor to consider is price – obviously, the higher range models will be more expensive but they will also generally offer better performance and features than entry-level microwaves. Many mid-priced models are great value too if you’re looking to save some money while still getting quality results from your appliance. 

Finally, always check online reviews before buying any type of kitchen appliance – these can provide an invaluable insight into how each model performs in terms of both features and performance in real life scenarios so you know exactly what you’re getting before handing over your hard earned cash!
