Shrinking clothes in the dryer is a common problem for many people, and it can be frustrating when your favorite shirt or pair of jeans shrinks after one wash. However, there are certain settings on your dryer that you should avoid in order to keep your clothes from shrinking.

The first thing to look for is the temperature setting. Most dryers have a high, medium, and low temperature setting. Generally speaking, you want to avoid using the highest heat setting on your dryer as this will cause fabrics to shrink more than if you use a lower heat setting. For delicate items like lingerie or sweaters, it's best to use the lowest heat setting or even air-dry them if possible.

Next, check out the cycle settings on your dryer. Many machines have options like "Permanent Press" or "Delicate." If you're trying to avoid shrinking clothes, these are great options as they often use lower temperatures and shorter drying times than regular cycles. Additionally, some machines may also have an "anti-shrink" cycle which is specifically designed for preventing fabric shrinkage. This can be a great option if you're worried about shrinking clothing items made of natural fibers like wool or cotton.

Finally, be sure to check out any special features that may be available on your machine such as steam cycles or wrinkle guard functions which can help reduce wrinkles and minimize fabric shrinkage in the dryer. 

In conclusion, there are several ways that you can prevent clothes from shrinking in the dryer including selecting lower heat settings and appropriate cycles for delicate items like lingerie and sweaters as well as taking advantage of any special features that may be available on your machine such as steam cycles or wrinkle guard functions. By following these tips, you should be able to keep your clothes looking new for longer!
