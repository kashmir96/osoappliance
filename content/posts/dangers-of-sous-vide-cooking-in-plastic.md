Sous vide cooking or slow cooking in plastic can be a potentially dangerous method of food preparation if not done properly. Sous vide is a method of cooking food in vacuum-sealed plastic bags submerged in water that’s kept at a consistent temperature. While this method allows for precise and even cooking, it can also increase the risk of bacterial contamination if not done correctly. 

The biggest danger associated with sous vide is plastic leaching into the food during the process. Sometimes the plastic containers and bags used for sous vide are not designed to withstand the high temperatures necessary for this method of cooking, meaning they could release potentially harmful chemicals into your food. Studies have shown that some plastic containers and bags contain substances like phthalates, bisphenols (BPA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), all of which are known to cause health problems such as cancer, neurological disorders, endocrine disruption and reproductive issues when consumed in large amounts over long periods of time. 

In addition to potential chemical contamination from the plastic containers themselves, there’s also a risk posed by bacteria growth due to inadequate temperature control during sous vide cooking. If your water bath isn’t heated or maintained at a consistent temperature throughout the entire process, bacteria can start to grow on the food inside your vacuum-sealed bag. This can lead to serious health risks if it isn’t killed off through proper reheating procedures before consuming. 

To reduce these risks when using sous vide as your chosen method of food preparation, it’s best practice to use only high-quality plastic containers or bags that have been approved safe for use with hot liquids or foods. It’s also important not to leave foods submerged too long; follow package instructions carefully on how long you should cook each item using this technique as well as what reheating methods should be utilized afterward. Finally, make sure you keep track of water temperatures throughout the entire process so that bacteria don’t have an opportunity to grow on your meal before it reaches its safe consumption temperature!
