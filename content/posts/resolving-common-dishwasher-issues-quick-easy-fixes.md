## Quick & Easy Fixes for Common Dishwasher Problems
Having a dishwasher in your home can save a great deal of time and energy. But from time to time, it can cause any number of problems. Fortunately many of the common issues can be resolved with a few simple fixes.

### Clean the Filters & Hoses
One of the most overlooked reasons for a dishwasher malfunction is a clogged filter or drain hose. Set aside a moment to check for any blockages and clean them out. Doing this quick and easy check can often take care of many of the issues you are having.

### Check the Water Supply
The water supply line should be delivering soft water to your dishwasher. When hard water is used, limescale could accumulate and cause the dishwasher to overflow. Make sure that a water softener is appropriately installed and working.

### Replace Worn Seals or Gaskets
If you're finding water on your kitchen floor after a cycle is finished, you may need to replace the worn seals or gaskets in your dishwasher. Make sure to inspect the seals and replace any that have stretched or torn. If they are worn and no longer closed, it may be time to contact an appliance technician.

### Test the Float Switch
The float switch located inside your dishwasher monitors the water level. If it is not functioning correctly, it may stop the dishwasher from filling with water. Try removing the float switch for a quick check, if it is no longer floating freely, it is time for a replacement.

### Check Sensors & Motors
Modern dishwashers rely on sensors and motors to get the job done. If there is an issue, these parts may need to be replaced. Unfortunately, these parts usually require the assistance of an experienced appliance technician to be replaced.

Having a dishwasher in your home can be a real convenience. Fortunately most of the common issues can be quickly resolved. But if the problems are more serious, it may be time to contact an [appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). They can help diagnose and repair your dishwasher, making sure it gets back to draining and cleaning your dishes as soon as possible.

## Common Dishwasher Issues

Then, use a scrub brush or special cleaning tools to loosen any remaining foods or debris before properly rinsing the filter with water.

3. What should I do if my dishwasher is leaking?
If your dishwasher is leaking, the first step is to figure out where the leak is coming from. Check the door and handles to ensure that the seal is not loose or broken.
