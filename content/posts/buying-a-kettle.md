If you’re in the market for a new kettle, there are a few things to keep in mind. A quality electric kettle can be an invaluable appliance for heating up water quickly and conveniently. But with so many different kettles on the market, it can be difficult to know which one is best for you. 

When buying a new kettle, consider what you need it for and what features are important to you. Do you want an energy-efficient model? Are ease of use and safety important? Or do you prefer something that looks stylish on your countertop? Whatever your needs are, here’s what you should look out for when buying a new electric kettle: 

1. Capacity - How much water do you need to heat each time? Some kettles come with large capacity (up to 1.7 liters), while others are smaller (less than 1 liter). Think about how much hot water you usually use at once, then choose an appropriate size kettle that won’t take up too much counter space. 

2. Temperature Control - If temperature control is important to you, look out for kettles with adjustable thermostats or built-in presets so that your water is always heated to just the right temperature every time. Some models even come with memory settings so that it remembers your preferred temperature from before! 

3. Safety Features - Check the product description carefully to make sure the model comes with all the necessary safety features such as auto shutoff and boil-dry protection (which turns off the power if there’s no liquid left in the pot). This will help prevent any potential hazards due to overboiling or overheating of liquids. 

4. Design - Finally, think about how well your chosen model will fit into your kitchen décor and lifestyle needs—from sleek stainless steel designs that blend into any kitchen aesthetic, or cordless models perfect for those who like their appliances mobile—there’s something out there that suits everyone! 

5. Heat retention - Some kettles are designed to keep your water hot for up to 30 minutes after boiling, ideal if you want to make multiple cups of tea without having to reheat the kettle over and over again. 

Buying a new electric kettle can be a great investment, but it’s important to find the right one for you. Consider these features when shopping around and you’ll be sure to find the perfect model for your needs!
