Kettles are often sold in the capacity of 1.7 liters and this size is not a coincidence. The reason why kettles are usually 1.7 liters is because thatâ€™s the optimal size for boiling enough water for most households. 

Most kettles have a maximum capacity of 1.7 liters and any larger would be too large to boil enough water for most households, while any smaller would not be able to hold enough water to make multiple cups of tea or coffee at once. This makes the capacity of 1.7 liters ideal, as it allows you to boil just enough water without taking up too much counter space in your kitchen or home office environment. 

Another benefit of having a kettle with a capacity of 1.7 liters is that it can quickly heat up the right amount of water using less energy than a bigger model would require. This makes it an energy-efficient choice and one that can help reduce your monthly electricity bills significantly over time if used regularly for boiling water for hot drinks or other purposes where you need hot water quickly and efficiently! 

In conclusion, kettles come in many different sizes but the most common one is usually 1.7 liters due to its optimal size which allows you to boil just enough water without taking up too much counter space while also saving energy by using less electricity than larger models would require!
