## Reliable Refrigeration is Essential to Home Food Storage

Having a reliable refrigerator is an essential part of storing food in the home. Without it, food spoils quickly, and the result is wasted time, energy, and money. It's important to take the time to assess your needs and choose the right refrigerator for your needs. Commercial refrigerators and freezers offer the convenience and reliability needed for proper food preservation.

When choosing a commercial stainless-steel refrigerator, several factors must be considered. Firstly, look for a model that exceeds the latest industry standards for energy efficiency. Some models include features such as a variable temperature control and frost-free feature, to reduce the amount of energy used. Also, make sure to pick a model with a strong warranty that covers both parts and labor.

Another important factor to consider is temperature control. Refrigerators can be set from a low of 41ºF to a high of 136ºF, giving you the ability to effectively store food in a variety of temperature ranges. Be sure to pick a model equipped with a thermostat to maintain the intended temperatures.

Finally, look for a durable construction made of quality materials. Commercial-grade stainless steel refrigerators and freezers are constructed with powerful steel, making them resistant to dents, rust and corrosion over time. The shelves should also be adjustable to allow for various storage needs.

By considering these factors and shopping wisely, you should be able to find a commercial refrigerator or freezer that stands the test of time. To get started, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to find the perfect fit for your refrigeration needs.
