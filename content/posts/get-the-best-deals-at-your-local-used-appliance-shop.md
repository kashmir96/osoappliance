## Find Great Deals at a Pre-Owned Appliance Shop Near You 
Looking to refresh your kitchen or laundry room but don't have the budget to buy brand new appliances? Don't worry! Used appliance shops often have great deals. Shopping local gives you the benefit of connecting with an expert in your area who can help guide you to the right appliance for your needs. 

Visiting a used appliance shop in person can help you get a first-hand look at a wide variety of products before selecting the one you want. You'll be able to inspect various products for quality, size, and any other factors you'd like to consider. You can also ask the store manager for advice on product maintenance, price comparison, and product selection.

Another advantage of shopping at a used appliance shop is the shorter turnaround time for delivery and installation. The appliance may already be in stock, so it can be delivered much quicker than an appliance purchased brand new from an online store. The staff of a local used appliance shop can also provide personalized installation and setup that can include removal of old appliances and recycling or disposal of them as well.

Used appliance shops also offer budget-friendly deals, such as reduced prices on minor cosmetic damage and closeout discounts. Many shops offer special promotions and deals that can help save you even more.

Now you know the many benefits to shopping local for used appliances. If youâ€™re looking to buy pre-owned appliances, check out our [List of Appliance Rental Companies](./pages/appliance-rental) to find the best deals near you.
