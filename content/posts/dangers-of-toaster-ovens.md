Toaster ovens are a popular appliance for busy households and their compact size makes them ideal for small kitchens. While toaster ovens can be convenient and energy efficient, they can also be dangerous if not used properly. Below are some of the potential risks associated with toaster ovens, and how to safely use them.

1. Fire Hazards: Toaster ovens can overheat, resulting in a fire if left unattended or not monitored carefully. This is especially true when using the broiling setting, as the heat from the top element can cause flammable materials or liquids placed too close to the appliance to catch fire. Always make sure that your toaster oven is unplugged when not in use, and don’t leave it unattended while it’s in operation. 

2. Burns: Toaster ovens get extremely hot during operation and if touched without proper protection such as an insulated glove or mitt, it can result in serious burns or even worse if you accidentally touch hot parts inside of the appliance like coils or heating elements. Always use caution when handling a hot toaster oven, use caution when cleaning it, and never put your hands near any of its working components while it is running. 

3. Electrocution: Toaster oven wiring may become damaged over time which could lead to electric shock if handled incorrectly so make sure that your wiring is regularly inspected by a licensed electrician for any signs of wear or damage before using your appliance again after long periods of disuse. 

4. Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: If there is poor ventilation around your toaster oven while you are using it – such as blocking vents with other kitchen appliances – fumes from burning food may linger instead of being vented out properly through your stove hood fan which could cause you to suffer carbon monoxide poisoning without realizing it until symptoms become severe such as headaches and dizziness as well as nausea vomiting etc.. Make sure that all vents on both your hood fan and stovetop are unobstructed at all times for proper ventilation during cooking . 

 
By following these safety tips you should have no trouble safely enjoying all the benefits that come with owning a Toaster Oven!
