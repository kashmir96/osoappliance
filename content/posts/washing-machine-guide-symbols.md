Whether you’re looking to buy a new washing machine or just learning how to use the one you already have, understanding the guide symbols on the machine can be a bit confusing. In this blog, we’ll explain what each of these symbols mean and how they can help you get the best out of your laundry routine. 

First, let’s look at temperature settings. Most washing machines will have a line of numbers indicating temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The higher the number on this line, the hotter the water will be during your load cycle. Generally speaking, hot water is ideal for whites and heavily soiled items while cold water is best for delicate fabrics and dark colors. 

The next symbol you might find on a washing machine is an image resembling a mountain peak with four wavy lines below it. This indicates that your washer has an extra rinse cycle that adds more water and detergent to ensure all dirt and soap residue has been removed from clothes. This setting should be used for items that are extremely dirty or heavily soiled like work uniforms or athletic gear. 

Next up is what looks like two arrows chasing each other within a circle – this means that your washing machine has an agitator action which swirls clothes around in order to clean them more effectively. This setting works well for items with tough stains like denim jeans or bath towels as it helps break up dirt particles more easily than other cycles do. 

Finally, there may also be a small picture of a lock – this means that your washer has an adjustable spin speed which allows you to control how fast clothes spin during their cycle in order to reduce wrinkles and make them easier to iron after they’ve been washed. Most machines offer several different speeds ranging from slow (ideal for delicate items) through medium (good for regular laundry loads) up to high (which is best if you want clothes dried quickly). 

By familiarizing yourself with these guide symbols on your washing machine, you’ll be able to get better results from every load of laundry!
