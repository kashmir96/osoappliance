The biggest oven in the world is located in Middletown, Connecticut, and was used to bake the world’s largest cookie. The oven is a revolving carousel oven measuring 40 feet long and 20 feet wide. It has the capacity to hold over 100 trays of cookies, each containing 17 dozen or 204 cookies per tray. In total, this giant oven can hold up to 20,800 cookies at one time! 

This enormous oven was built by Middleby Marshall Inc., a company that specializes in commercial cooking equipment. It took them two weeks to construct and install it on site at the Bakers of Bloomfield Bakery where the record-breaking cookie was baked. The massive cookie itself weighed over 18 thousand pounds and measured 101 feet by 102 feet—the size of an entire football field! 

Not only does this amazing oven hold the title for being the biggest in the world but it also bakes with remarkable speed and efficiency. Using radiant heat technology, this massive appliance can bake up to 1 million cookies per hour! This means that no matter how huge your baking needs are—this giant machine can handle them all with ease. 

If you’re looking for an efficient way to bake large quantities of delicious treats then look no further than this incredible record-holding beast of an oven!
