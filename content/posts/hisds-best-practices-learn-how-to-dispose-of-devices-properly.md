## Disposing of Electronics Safely and Effectively

With the ever-growing presence of electronics and appliances in our everyday lives, investing in the knowledge and best practices of how to properly and safely dispose of these devices once their usefulness has expired is essential. Houston Independent School District (HISD) has recognized the need for educations on responsible appliance disposal, and have created some best practices to help you recycle your electronics correctly and keep harmful chemicals out of the environment.

There are few methods of disposing of unwanted electronics and appliances. The most direct and efficient route is to bring the device to a local recycling facility in your area. Although many cities offer free recycling services, there may be extra costs to recycle certain items, depending on the material and quantity. A second option, is to look for online services that offer to purchase devices and parts from you; this could be a good option to selling some of the devices you no longer use. Lastly, you can, in some cases, donate them to an organization of your choice. 

When approaching any of these options, it is imperative that you remove your personal data, account information and personal pictures from the device before proceeding with the disposing process. Additionally, it is good practice to dismantle any and all parts of the device you are recycling. Knowing how the device was composed will help you deal with any hazardous materials appropriately, such as batteries, liquid coolants, and combustible liquids, which could be dangers to the environment and cause health issues if carelessly discarded.

HISD has created a few best practices for disposing of electronics that not only concern the devices but provides education to its staff and facilities to enable them to properly dispose of them. By investing into the safety and education of its faculty, HISD is teaching about the proper disposal practices for our collective benefit. 

Taking action to properly discard electronics and appliances will ensure we are not contributing to unnecessary harm to our environment. With recycling facilities in most cities, and online services offering to purchase or donate these items, embracing a responsible lifestyle has become easier and more accessible. To ensure that the appliance disposal process is handled with care, contact a reliable appliance repair technician that you can trust.
