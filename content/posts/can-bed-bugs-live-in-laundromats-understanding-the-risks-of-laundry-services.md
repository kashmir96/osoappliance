## Can Bed Bugs Live in Laundromats? Understanding the Risks of Laundry Services 

If you’ve ever done laundry at a laundromat, you’re likely familiar with the convenience and affordability that comes with it. However, as with any public space, there are risks associated with using a laundromat for your laundry needs. One potential risk is bed bugs, which can live and breed in any public space where people congregate. 

Bed bugs are tiny insects that feed on human blood. They hide in dark areas such as carpets and fabric folds during the day, then come out at night to feed on their victims. Because they are so small and hard to spot, they can easily go unnoticed until an infestation has become well-established. Unfortunately, this means that if you frequent a laundromat regularly enough, you may be at risk of bringing home some unwanted passengers on your clothing or other items that have come into contact with bedding or furniture in the facility. 

The best way to protect yourself from bed bugs when using a laundromat is to inspect all surfaces before sitting down or putting your belongings down on them – look for dark spots where they may be hiding and keep an eye out for any signs of bites or rashes on yourself after leaving the facility. Additionally, it's important to use care when handling other people's belongings – wear gloves if possible and avoid touching anything that could potentially harbor bed bugs (such as linens). Finally, make sure to wash all fabrics immediately upon returning home from the laundromat; this will help ensure that any hitchhiking pests don't end up living in your own home! 

 If avoiding potential exposure from bedbugs is important for you than renting a washer/dryer unit might be more attractive option than going to a public establishment like a Laundromat - especially now during times of pandemics like Covid-19 where health & safety matters more than ever!
