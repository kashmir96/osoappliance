## The Necessity of Upkeep on Heat Pumps

Regular upkeep is a must in keeping any consumer appliance running smoothly. The same rule applies to heat pumps as well. Keeping up with recommended or required maintenance ensures safety and ensures the efficiency of the appliance over its lifespan.

For heat pumps, maintenance typically consists of filter changes, system testing, overall inspections of the entire unit, and periodic replacement/repairs of certain components. Dirty filters can restrict proper airflow and negatively affect energy efficiency and performance. Testing systems and making sure the coils are working properly are just a few of the essential aspects of maintenance. If the heat exchange, blower, or fan motor have failed, those components will need to be replaced or repaired.

Reasons for maintenance are vary, and even more so for a heat pump system. To make sure the heat pump is working optimally and efficiently, have a certified and licensed HVAC service do regular maintenance. Doing this, can potentially save hundreds and hundreds of dollars a year in energy costs. Not to mention, ensure the life expectancy of the heat pump.

Doing proper maintenance also ensures that the heat pump is operating safely and is not emitting carbon monoxide or other hazardous gases. Lack of maintenance or improper maintenance can be a major health hazard and potential fire hazard. Whenever the heat pump is serviced, it's a good idea to also check the exhaust system outside of the house.
