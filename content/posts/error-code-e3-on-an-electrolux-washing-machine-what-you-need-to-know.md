## Understanding Error Code E3 On An Electrolux Washing Machine 
When it comes to household appliances, there’s nothing worse than not understanding why they aren’t working. For example, if you have an Electrolux washing machine and see error code E3, you may be confused and uncertain how to fix the problem. Knowing the cause, how to troubleshoot, and correct it gives you the power to get your machine working again with minimal delay. 

Error code E3 indicates a mechanical or drain fault with the washing machine. Specifically, it signifies that the drain outlet hose of the washing machine is blocked or clogged. To fix this, you must unclog or clean it and ensure it is free from blockage. This typically involves detaching the hose from the washing machine and washing out the debris that has built up inside (lint, pet hair, etc). 

Sometimes, the code can also indicate that the drain pump is faulty and not working as expected. In this case, the pump must be checked, cleared of any debris, and possibly replaced. You can check if the pump is working by accessing it through the back of the washing machine. 

It’s important to note that the process and steps to take may vary slightly depending on the specific model and make of your washing machine. Also, if neither of these steps solves the error E3 issue, it may be best to call a professional and check why your washing machine is not draining properly. 

Ultimately, by understanding error code E3 and what is needed to fix it, you have the ability to troubleshoot, service, and repair your Electrolux washing machine. This saves time and also ensures a safe and secure washing experience for yourself and your family.
