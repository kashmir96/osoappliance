## How To Deal with Reduced Rent and a Faulty Washing Machine

Having your rent reduced is always a great feeling. However, many times this comes with a hidden cost - your appliances may be experiencing extra wear and tear due to the reduced budget in maintaining them. If you find your washing machine has suddenly stopped working, you may be left wondering what to do next. 

Before calling up a repair technician, it's important to identify the exact nature of the problem. If you're lucky, it could be something as simple as a broken circuit breaker or loose cord connections. These are easy to address and can be taken care of in no time. 

If the issue seems to be more complicated, it may be a good idea to get a professional to take a look at it. An experienced technician will be able to diagnose the fault correctly and perform the necessary repairs with ease.
