## What is the Average Life Expectancy of an Oven?
Buying a new oven can seem like quite a financial commitment, so it's natural that potential buyers will want to ensure they are getting good value for their investment. Knowing the ovenâ€™s expected life span is helpful for making an informed purchase decision.

The life span of an oven will depend on a number of different factors, such as the brand and model, the quality of components used, the frequency of cleaning and maintenance, the temperature and intensity of use, and interference from external sources. Generally, electric ovens tend to last longer than gas ovens when put under regular use.

High-end ovens tend to have more efficient components that last longer. For example, fan-assisted heating elements will not become excessively hot, so they often last longer than conventional ovens that run at higher temperatures.

In terms of maintenance, regular cleaning, de-greasing, checking of seals and hoses, and slight calibrations, goes a long way in ensuring the oven will last longer. Even regular checks to maintain the correct temperature can help to extend the oven's life by a significant margin.

The average life of an oven will depend on its quality and the frequency of use. Generally speaking, a quality electric oven can last anywhere between 10-15 years, while a non-commercial quality gas oven may only last for 5-7 years. 

When investing in an oven, be sure to look for good quality components that are capable of withstanding high temperatures, and conserve purchase order correctly. If you take care of an oven and ensure regular maintenance, you can help to ensure that your oven lasts for many years to come.
