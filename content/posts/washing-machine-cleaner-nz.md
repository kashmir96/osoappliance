Are you looking for an effective way to clean your washing machine? If so, then you should consider using a washing machine cleaner. Washing machine cleaners are designed to break down the build-up of dirt and grime that accumulates in the machine over time. This build-up can cause your laundry to come out looking dull and dingy, as well as can cause unpleasant odours.

In New Zealand, there are a number of washing machine cleaners available on the market. The most popular type of cleaner is a liquid solution that is added directly into the drum of your washing machine before each cycle. This type of cleaner is designed to dissolve any limescale and other deposits that can accumulate on the inside surfaces of your washer over time, helping it stay clean and efficient.

Another option is an in-drum cleaner, which works by releasing a cleaning agent into the drum during each cycle. These cleaners typically contain enzymes or surfactants which help break down dirt and grime from fabrics and can even help remove stains from whites! In-drum cleaners are also often formulated with odour neutralisers, leaving your laundry smelling fresh after every wash.

Finally, some brands offer pre-treater tablets or sachets which you add to each wash load before starting the cycle. These tablets help lift stains from fabrics before entering the washer's drum so that they don't get locked into fabrics during cleaning cycles. They also leave behind a pleasant scent on finished laundry items! 

Whichever type of washing machine cleaner you choose, be sure to follow all instructions carefully so that it works effectively in removing dirt and other residue from your washer's interior surfaces without damaging them in any way!
