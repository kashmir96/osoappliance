If you’re looking to wire up an oven, it’s important to understand the risks that come with attempting this job yourself. Oven wiring is a complex and potentially dangerous job, so it’s best to leave the work to a professional electrician.

An oven requires more power than most other kitchen appliances. It can draw anywhere from 3000-5000 watts of electricity – far more than even the largest refrigerator or dishwasher. As such, it’s important that your oven is properly wired before use. This means connecting the right gauge wires and making sure everything is up to code – something that is best left in the hands of an expert electrician.

In addition to being a complicated job, wiring an oven incorrectly can have catastrophic consequences. An electrical fire or shock hazard could occur if your wiring isn't done properly. Additionally, any mistakes could void your home insurance policy if something goes wrong further down line. 

To ensure that your oven wiring is done safely and correctly, it’s always best to hire a professional electrician for the job. A good electrician will be familiar with all local building codes related to electrical wiring and should provide you with all necessary permits for their work as well as instructions on how to operate your new oven safely once it has been wired correctly. 

Remember: when it comes to home appliances like an oven, safety should always come first! Don’t attempt this dangerous task yourself – leave it up to a qualified professional!
