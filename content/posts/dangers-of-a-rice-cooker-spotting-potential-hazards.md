## Identifying Potential Hazards in Rice Cookers
As rice cookers are a convenient and often-used household appliance, it’s important for general consumers to be aware of the potential hazards that can arise when using them. To help ensure your safety when cooking rice in your home or a professional kitchen, here are a few tips on how to spot potential dangers.

First, keep an eye out for any strange smells coming from the rice cooker. Smoke or burning odors may be a sign of trouble and should never be ignored, as they could potentially be a sign of faulty wiring or a loose connection between the plug and the outlet. If this is the case, you should never attempt to fix the cooker yourself, as electrocution could put you at risk. 

In addition to being attentive to strange smells, it's important to be mindful of the power cord of your cooker. Damaged power cords can be hazardous, and should not be used. If the cable is frayed and the insulation is worn, it must be replaced immediately. If you do not feel comfortable with replacing it yourself, it is best to contact a qualified technician.

Safety should also be a top priority when cleaning your cooker. Before doing so, it is crucial to always unplug the appliance and allow it to cool completely. Rice cooker interiors and exteriors can get dangerously hot, and scratches, rust, and burns are uncomfortable reminders of not being careful during the process.

Finally, rice cookers can be a source of food contamination if not kept clean and stored away from raw food. After finishing cooking, make sure you open the lid and clean away any remaining rice or grains from the inner bowl and lid. 

When using a rice cooker, it’s important to remain mindful of the safety precautions outlined above to avoid any potential hazards. If you need assistance from a repair technician, be sure to check our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for help.
