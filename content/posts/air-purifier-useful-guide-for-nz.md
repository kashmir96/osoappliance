Are you looking to make your home air healthier? Air purifiers are the perfect solution. But with so many options available, how do you choose the right one for your needs? We’ve put together this useful guide to help you choose the right air purifier for your home in New Zealand. 

First, think about what type of pollutants you want to remove from your home’s air. Common indoor pollutants include dust particles, pet dander, smoke, mould spores, and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). Depending on the type of pollutant(s) in your home’s air, different types of air purifiers are better suited than others. 

For example, if you’re looking to remove pollen and dust particles from the air in your home, then a HEPA filter is ideal. HEPA filters are capable of trapping 99% of airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns – making them extremely efficient at removing even the smallest pollutants from the air. 

If you’re looking to eliminate smoke and odors from indoor spaces such as kitchens or smoking areas then an activated carbon filter is a great option. These filters use natural activated carbon to absorb odors and gases like formaldehyde or benzene which can cause health problems if left unchecked. 

Finally, if mould spores or VOCs are an issue in your home then it might be worth investing in a UV light-based purifier which will kill off any bacteria or viruses present in the air before they have a chance to spread throughout your house. 

When buying an air purifier for New Zealand homes it is important to think about size too – not just efficiency level! If you have a large open-plan living space with high ceilings then you will need an appropriately sized unit that can circulate enough clean filtered air around all areas of your home without any dead spots where pollution may accumulate again quickly after being removed by the unit itself. 

Finally, don’t forget about energy efficiency when selecting an appropriate purified for New Zealand homes – some models consume more electricity than others and this could add up significantly over time depending on how often they are used! Look out for models that have energy star ratings or other indicators that they use minimal energy while still providing excellent results when it comes to cleaning up polluted indoor spaces!
