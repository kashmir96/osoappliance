If you're a Calgary resident who owns used appliances, it's important to be prepared for any eventuality. Having spare parts on hand can save you time, money and frustration when something goes wrong with your appliance. Here are some of the essential used appliance parts Calgary people should keep in their home.

First and foremost, it's important to have replacement filters for your refrigerator. The filter ensures that the air inside is clean, so if yours isn't working properly, you may need to replace it with a new one. Additionally, having an extra water filter on hand will help keep contaminants from entering your drinking water and making sure it tastes better than ever before. 

It's also wise to have extra door seals for your refrigerator or freezer since they tend to wear out over time due to constant use and exposure to humidity. These seals ensure that cold air stays inside and warm air stays outside of the unit; if they become damaged or worn down, replacing them is necessary in order for the appliance to function properly. 

Another must-have part is an ice maker kit, which includes all the necessary components needed in order to install an ice maker into most refrigerators or freezers. If you already have an ice maker but it stops working correctly or breaks down completely, having a kit on-hand will prevent you from needing costly repairs or replacements from a professional technician. 

Finally, Calgary homeowners should always make sure they have spare bulbs for their ovens or microwaves because these can easily burn out over time due to frequent use and high temperatures produced by these appliances during cooking sessions. Having replacements ready will help avoid any potential kitchen disasters! 

Overall, keeping spare parts at home is essential for anyone with used appliances in Calgary; not only does it provide peace of mind but also helps protect against potentially costly repairs down the line!
