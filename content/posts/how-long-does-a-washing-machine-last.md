When it comes to appliances, the life expectancy of a washing machine can vary greatly depending on the type and quality of the machine. But in general, most washing machines last between 8-12 years. 

For those looking to purchase a new washing machine, the life expectancy of the machine should be a major factor in the decision-making process. Not only do you want to get the best performance out of your machine, but you also want to make sure that it will last as long as possible.

The life expectancy of a washing machine is largely determined by the type of machine you purchase. Front-loading washing machines tend to last longer than top-loading machines, as they are more energy efficient and use less water. High-efficiency washing machines are also known to last longer, as they are designed to use less energy and water than traditional machines. 

The quality of the machine is also an important factor in determining how long it will last. Higher-end machines tend to last longer than cheaper models, as they are made with better materials and have more advanced features. 

In addition to the type and quality of the machine, the way it is used can also affect its life expectancy. Regular maintenance and cleaning are essential for keeping a washing machine running smoothly and extending its life. It is also important to only use the machine for its intended purpose and not overload it with too many clothes at once.

Finally, the environment in which the washing machine is used can also influence its life expectancy. Machines that are kept in humid or damp environments are more likely to experience corrosion and other problems that can reduce their lifespan.

In conclusion, the life expectancy of a washing machine can vary greatly depending on the type, quality, and usage of the machine. On average, most washing machines last between 8-12 years, but with proper care and maintenance, they can last even longer.
