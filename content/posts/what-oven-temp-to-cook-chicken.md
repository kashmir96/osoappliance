When it comes to preparing chicken, oven temperature is key to ensuring a delicious, juicy and safe final product. The ideal oven temperature for cooking chicken varies depending on the size and type of chicken you are cooking.

For whole chickens, roasters, and other large pieces of poultry, the best oven temperature is 350°F (177°C). This allows for the heat to penetrate all areas of the chicken evenly and cook it through without drying out or burning. If you’re using a convection oven, set it to 325°F (163°C) — this will help the heat circulate more evenly throughout your dish.

If you’re cooking smaller, boneless cuts of chicken such as breasts or tenders, then 400°F (204°C) is usually a good starting point. This will ensure that they cook quickly and evenly without drying out. You can also adjust this temperature depending on how crispy you’d like your finished dish to be — just keep in mind that higher temperatures may cause the exterior of your chicken to burn before it has finished cooking through.

Finally, if you’re baking boneless chicken that is already cooked or partially cooked (such as frozen breasts or tenders), then 375°F (191°C) should be sufficient. This will help warm up your dish without overcooking it and drying out the meat. 

No matter what type of chicken you’re cooking, always use a thermometer to check for doneness before serving — this will ensure that your finished product reaches an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C). And above all else, enjoy!
