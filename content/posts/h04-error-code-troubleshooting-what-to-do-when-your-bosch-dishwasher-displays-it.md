## H04 Error Code Troubleshooting for Bosch Dishwashers

Are you wondering why your Bosch dishwasher is now displaying an error code H04? You're not alone, as many Bosch dishwasher owners will see this error code throughout the life of their appliance. This article explains what the error code H04 stands for, as well as provides troubleshooting tips and steps to reset your dishwasher back to its normal operating state.

H04 is an error code indicating an issue with the draining process. This is usually associated with a blocked or clogged drain pump, an inability to pump down water or a failed drain pump. In some cases, the H04 error code can also be due to a damaged water inlet valve.

In order to troubleshoot the issue, first make sure that the drain hose is clear of any blockages and free from any kinks. If the drain hose is clear, then you will need to open up your dishwasher and check if anything is blocking the drain pump or if the drain pump is damaged. If cleaning the drainage system does not work, then you may need to replace the drain pump or repair the water inlet valve.

If the issue with your dishwasher is not resolved, then you may need to reach out to a professional appliance repair technician for additional assistance.

If your dishwasher is displaying the H04 error code, then following the steps above should help resolving the issue. Having a comprehensive appliance error codes glossary handy can also be a great reference to look out for more error codes.
