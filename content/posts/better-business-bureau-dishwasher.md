The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is a great resource for consumers looking to buy a new dishwasher. With their ratings and reviews, you can be sure to make an informed decision when selecting the right model for your home. 

When researching dishwashers, the BBB provides helpful information about both the product and the company selling it. As part of their ratings system, they assign each model with an overall grade ranging from A+ to F. This grade is based on customer reviews, complaints filed against the product or its manufacturer, advertising accuracy and other factors related to business practices. 

The BBB also collects customer feedback that is used in their reviews. This feedback includes comments about how well the dishwasher works and how satisfied customers are with their purchase. Reviews can also help you decide which features are important to consider when making your choice – such as energy efficiency or noise level – so you’ll know what questions to ask when comparing models at different stores. 

Finally, if you have any issues or concerns after buying a dishwasher from a particular retailer, the BBB can provide assistance in resolving them through its dispute resolution services. They will work with both parties involved in order to reach an agreement that is satisfactory for everyone involved. 

Overall, using the BBB’s ratings and reviews system is a great way to make sure you’re getting a quality product at a good price from an ethical business who will stand behind it should any problems arise down the road.
