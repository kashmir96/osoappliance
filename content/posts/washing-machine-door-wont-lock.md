# Washing machine door wont lock

If your washing machine door won't lock, it can be a huge inconvenience. Not only will it prevent you from doing laundry, but it can also be a safety hazard if the door opens during the cycle. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to try and fix this issue. 

The first thing to do is check and make sure that the door latch is properly aligned. If the latch is misaligned, it may not be able to engage with the locking mechanism properly. If this is the case, you may need to adjust or replace the latch. 

Next, make sure that all of the hinges on the door are in good working order and not loose or damaged in any way. If they are loose or damaged, they may need to be tightened or replaced before you can get your washing machine door to lock again. 

Finally, check for any obstructions in the locking mechanism itself. This could include dirt or debris that has built up over time and is preventing the lock from engaging properly. If this is the case, you may need to clean out any debris before attempting to lock your washing machine door again. 

If none of these solutions work for you then it could be an issue with your washing machine's control board or wiring harness which would require professional repair services from an appliance technician. 

In conclusion, if your washing machine door won't lock then there are several potential causes that could be causing this issue including misaligned latches, loose hinges and obstructions in the locking mechanism itself. With a little bit of troubleshooting and some basic maintenance tasks like cleaning out debris or tightening screws, you should be able to get your washing machine door locked again in no time!
