If your dryer smells like fish, it could be a sign of a few different problems. It is important to identify and address the issue as soon as possible to prevent further damage to your dryer and/or laundry. 

The first possibility is that you have a dead mouse or other small animal trapped in your dryer vent. This is a fairly common problem, especially in the summer months when rodents are more active. If you suspect this is the case, you should immediately call a professional to remove the animal and clean the vent. 

Another possible cause of a fishy smell in your dryer is a build-up of lint. Lint can become trapped in the dryer vent, creating a damp environment that can harbor bacteria and other microorganisms. To prevent this from happening, it is important to clean out the lint trap after every load of laundry. Additionally, you should have your dryer vent professionally inspected and cleaned every few years to ensure it is not clogged. 

Finally, a fishy smell can also be caused by a problem with your washing machine. If you have recently used a detergent, or washed clothing that contains fish oils or other fish-based ingredients, the smell could be coming from the washing machine and being passed in the wet clothes to the dryer. To prevent this from happening, make sure to read the labels on your detergents and avoid using any that contain fish-based ingredients. 

No matter what the cause of the fishy smell in your dryer is, it is important to address the issue as soon as possible. If left unchecked, this issue can cause a fire hazard and damage to your dryer and/or laundry. If you suspect a problem, contact a professional to inspect and clean your dryer vent and washing machine.
