When it comes to creating a healthy home environment, air purifiers and humidifiers are often touted as lifesavers. However, while these devices can provide many benefits, they can also be dangerous when not used correctly or if they are not properly maintained. In this blog, we'll explore the dangers of using air purifiers and humidifiers in your home and what you should know before buying one. 

Air Purifier Dangers

Air purifiers help to reduce airborne contaminants such as dust, pollen, pet dander, smoke particles and more from the air in your home. However, some air purifiers can release ozone gas into the air which can be harmful to humans if inhaled over a long period of time. Ozone is an irritant that can cause shortness of breath or asthma attacks in people with respiratory conditions or sensitivities. To avoid this problem make sure you buy an air purifier that does not generate ozone gas and always keep your windows open when using it. 

Humidifier Dangers 

Humidifiers add moisture back into the air which helps to reduce dryness in your home but they can also be dangerous if they are not properly maintained. Humidifiers that are not cleaned regularly may become contaminated with mold or bacteria which can then be released back into the air causing health problems such as allergies or respiratory illness. To avoid this problem always make sure to clean your humidifier according to its instructions and never use tap water as it could contain minerals that will encourage bacterial growth inside the device. 

Overall, while both air purifiers and humidifiers have their benefits they also come with risks so it is important to make sure you understand how these devices work before purchasing them for your home. Always read up on any product before buying it and make sure you follow all instructions for maintenance carefully once you do purchase it!
