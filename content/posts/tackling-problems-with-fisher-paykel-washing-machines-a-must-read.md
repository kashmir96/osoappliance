## Get to Know Fisher & Paykel Washing Machines and Common Repair Issues

Fisher & Paykel washing machines are internationally renowned for their innovative design and top-of-the-line technology. When things go wrong with these dependable appliances, though, it can be overwhelming for the average user with limited technical know-how. Keeping up with maintenance, repairs and parts replacements can be a hassle, regardless of the make and model of your machine.

Fortunately, this guide provides useful tips on proper care and maintenance of Fisher & Paykel washing machines, as well as advice on how to address common appliance repair issues quickly and efficiently.

## Useful Maintenance Tips and Expert Advice

The best way to ensure your Fisher & Paykel washer works well and lasts through many years of use is proper maintenance. Regularly checking and cleaning the drain filter and drain hose helps reduce the possibility of clogging or buildup of soap residue. Also, cleaning the top lid and lid seal prevents mold and bacteria from building up and attempting to work your way around the machineâ€™s intricate inner parts should be avoided, as this may void the warranty.

It is also important to note that the proper water temperature for the machine should be set correctly each time a load is done. Too much heat can damage some parts of the washer, so going through the manual and finding out what temperature works best for the kind of laundry being done is essential.

When things do go wrong, seeking the help of a qualified appliance repair technician is the best way to address the issues. Often times, these professionals can identify and repair the issue quickly and efficiently, reducing the amount of time and money spent on repairs.
