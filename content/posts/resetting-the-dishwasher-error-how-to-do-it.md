## Resetting Dishwasher Errors: A Step-by-Step Guide
One of the most common issues with a dishwasher are errors that need to be reset. As daunting as that may sound, it's actually a fairly easy process. This guide will take you through the steps for resetting a dishwasher to restore it to regular operating mode. 

When resetting a dishwasher, the first step is to identify the cause of the error. Find the error code displayed or listed in the owner's manual and reference our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to figure out what's wrong. Once the issue is identified, the following steps can be used to reset the dishwasher:

1. Unplug the dishwasher from the outlet, wait 10-15 minutes, and then plug it back in. 
2. Select the rinse option and let the water fill. 
3. Push the start button and let the machine complete the cycle.

The process can vary slightly depending on the make and model of the appliance, so please consult your user manual for specific instructions. 

By following these steps, you can easily reset your dishwasher to restore it to normal operating mode. However, if the problem persists, contact an appliance repair professional for assistance.
