### What Is An Industrial Air Purifier? 
An industrial air purifier is a device that removes dirt, dust, pollen and other airborne particles from indoor spaces like offices or homes. These machines typically use filters or electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to remove harmful particles from the environment. By doing so, they help reduce the risk of airborne illnesses caused by diseases like asthma or allergies caused by pollutants in the home or office environment. 

### How Does It Work? 
Industrial air purifiers work by filtering out particles from the air via either filters or ESPs. Filters work by trapping pollutants on their surface while ESPs use an electrical charge to attract and capture airborne particles in its mesh plates before they enter into your lungs through breathing them in through your nose/mouth area.. This ensures that any potential allergens are kept out of your living space resulting in improved indoor air quality for everyone who enters into it!
