Error codes can often be seen flashing on a digital display on your heat pump, or present on a LED display. If your heat pump is having trouble, the first thing you should do is inspect your system for any visible issues, such as loose wires, burnt marks, damage to the wiring, broken or bent fins, or other visible problems.
