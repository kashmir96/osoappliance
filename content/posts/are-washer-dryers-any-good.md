While washer dryers are convenient and space saving, a great characteristic for people with small homes, generally these machines don't perform as well as separate washers and dryers. 

Washer dryers are usually more expensive than buying a separate washer and dryer, and they don't typically last as long. Washer dryers are great for people who don't have a lot of space, as they are much smaller than two separate machines. 

They also save time, as you can do a load of laundry and then dry it all in one machine. 

However, washer dryers are usually not as energy efficient as two separate machines, and they don't always dry clothes as well as a separate dryer. They can take significantly longer to dry a load of laundry than a separate dryer. 

This is because the washer dryer has to heat up the water, wash the clothes, and then dry them, all in one cycle. This can take a long time, and the clothes may not be as dry as you'd like. Washer dryers are also more expensive than buying two separate machines. 

They are typically more expensive to repair and maintain, and they don't usually last as long as two separate machines. 

In conclusion, while washer dryers are convenient and space saving, they don't usually perform as well as two separate machines. They are usually more expensive and don't last as long. If you have the space and the budget, two separate machines are usually the better option.
