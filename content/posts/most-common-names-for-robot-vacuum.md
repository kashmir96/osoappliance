Robot vacuums are the latest craze in home cleaning, allowing homeowners to keep their homes clean while they're away or busy with other tasks. But with so many brands and models available on the market, it can be hard to know what to look for when shopping for a robot vacuum. That's why it's important to know some of the most common names used when referring to robot vacuums. 

The Roomba is perhaps the most popular name in robot vacuum cleaners. The Roomba was first introduced by iRobot in 2002 and has since become synonymous with robotic vacuums. The Roomba is a disc-shaped device that uses built-in sensors to detect dirt and debris in a room and then moves autonomously around the room cleaning it up. It even knows how to return back to its charging station when its battery is low or if it needs more power for difficult spots. 

The Neato Botvac is another popular choice among robotic vacuum owners. This model has an innovative D-shape design which helps it get into tight spaces like corners, along walls, and under furniture better than traditional round robots like the Roomba. Additionally, Neato robots feature lasers that help them map out rooms before beginning their cleaning cycles so they can efficiently clean all areas of a room without missing any spots or going over areas multiple times. 

Another popular name associated with robotic vacuums is Shark Ion Robot Vacuum Cleaner which offers users an easy way to keep their floors clean without having to use manual labor or electricity from an outlet as many other models do not require being plugged into an outlet at all times while being used.. Shark Ion Robot Vacuum Cleaner features voice control compatibility meaning you can control your device using voice commands via Amazon Alexa or Google Home! Additionally, these devices come equipped with technology such as anti-drop sensors which help prevent them from falling down stairs while cleaning your floors plus smart navigation mapping capabilities that allow them learn and remember paths around your home for more efficient cleaning cycles each time you use them! 

Finally, there’s Samsung’s POWERbot line of robotic vacuums which offer users powerful suction capabilities as well as edge cleaning technology designed specifically for hardwood floors! These devices also feature Wi-Fi connectivity allowing users remote control over their robots via smartphone app plus extra long battery life so you don’t have worry about always having your device plugged into an outlet just waiting until its next charge cycle comes up - great news if you plan on using these bots often!
