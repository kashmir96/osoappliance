If your oven won't stay on, it could be a sign of a serious problem. There are a few potential causes that can explain why your oven won’t stay on. 

The first potential cause is a faulty thermostat. The thermostat is responsible for controlling the temperature of the oven. If the thermostat is not functioning correctly, it could cause your oven to turn off prematurely. To fix this, you may need to replace the thermostat. 

Another potential cause is a broken heating element. The heating element is what actually heats the oven, so if it is not working correctly, your oven won’t stay on. To fix this, you may need to replace the heating element.

Another potential cause is a faulty wiring connection. If the wiring connections are not secure, the oven may not be able to receive the power it needs to stay on. To fix this, you may need to inspect the wiring connections and make sure they are properly connected.

Finally, your oven may not be staying on because it is not receiving enough power. If this is the case, you may need to check your circuit breaker and make sure it is not tripped. If it is, you will need to reset it in order to restore power to the oven.

If your oven won’t stay on, it could be due to one of these potential causes. To determine the cause, you may need to inspect the wiring connections, check the thermostat, and inspect the heating element. Once you have identified the cause, you can take the necessary steps to fix the problem.
