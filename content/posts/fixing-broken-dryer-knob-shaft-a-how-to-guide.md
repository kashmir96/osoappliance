## Learn to Fix a Broken Dryer Knob Shaft
When a broken dryer knob shaft leaves you with limited options to get your dryer running, it can be frustrating. Fortunately, with some elbow grease, the right tools and a bit of patience, it’s possible to repair the knob shaft of your dryer yourself. 

This simple guide will help you get started with repairing a broken dryer knob shaft. First, you’ll need to collect the tools you need. To make the repair, you’ll need a Phillips head screwdriver, a drill, some screws and a shaft that fits your dryer model. You’ll also need to identify the right replacement part.

Once you have all the necessary tools, you can begin. First, unplug your dryer from the wall outlet to ensure that there's no power running to it. Then, locate the knob shaft located on the top or side of the dryer. 

Remove the screws that hold the knob shaft in place and then carefully remove the knob shaft. Once the knob shaft is removed, take a look at the shaft's design and compare it to the one you purchased as a replacement, ensuring that they're a match. 

Next, using the drill, remove the old mounting holes from the shaft and then drill new ones in the same locations as the old ones, leaving enough room to secure the new shaft. Once you've made the new holes, you can secure the new knob shaft in place. Insert small, Phillips head screws into each hole to keep the shaft attached to the dryer. 

Once you've fixed the dryer knob shaft and securely attached it, you're ready to get back to drying your clothes. 

Fixing a broken dryer knob shaft can be easier than you’d expect with some patience and the right tools and replacement parts. As with any DIY appliance repair project, it’s important to disconnect the power from the appliance when working and to find a replacement part that matches the model of your dryer correctly.
