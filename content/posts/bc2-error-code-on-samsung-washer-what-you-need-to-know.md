## The BC2 Error Code on Samsung Washers: What You Need to Know 

It's not uncommon to run into some issues while using your household appliances. In the case of a Samsung washer, the BC2 error code is common and it can be daunting if you don’t know what it means. In this blog, we’ll provide you with an overview of the BC2 error code and how to diagnose and resolve this issue. 

The BC2 error code is a motor error that indicates a problem with the motor, belt, or filter of your Samsung washer. When this code appears, the water valves that supply water to the washer will close automatically, but the washer will keep spinning for quite a while without water. The washer will continue to spin until it senses the increase in temperature from the heated motor, at which point it will stop spinning and display the BC2 error code. 

The best way to diagnose and troubleshoot this issue is to first examine the motor, belt, and filter of your Samsung washer. If there are no signs of wear and tear, then the problem is likely caused by an overload on the motor or a short circuit. To solve this overload issue, you should unplug the machine and let it rest for a few minutes before reconnecting the power cord and trying the cycle again. 

If the BC2 error continues to appear on your Samsung washer, then the issue is likely a short circuit, or a more serious error within the washer. In this case, you will need to contact a professional technician for further diagnosis and repair. 

Understanding the BC2 error code on Samsung washers can be daunting but, with this guide, hopefully you now have a better understanding of the issue.
