## Unlock the Mystery of Cleaning Refrigerator Doors
Keeping your refrigerator doors looking like new is a simple task. By following our expert tips, you can quickly and easily clean your stainless steel doors and keep them looking like new for years to come.

First, start by prepping the surface. Blot any moisture from the door with a microfiber cloth. If the door is especially dirty, use a mild soap and sponge to clean it before you begin polishing it. 

To remove dirt and grime, choose a stainless steel cleaner and polish. Spray the polish onto a soft cotton cloth and follow the grain of the steel as you wipe it across the surfaces. Once polished, switch to a clean, dry cloth. Use this to buff away any residual cleaner. This step will help to protect the stainless steel finish and also give it an appealing shine.

For any stuck-on grease, try using a small amount of baking soda and hot water. Dip a sponge into the mixture and lightly scrub the surfaces of the door. If the grease does not come off with the first attempt, apply a bit of pressure and repeat the process. Be sure to rinse any cleaner off the door with a damp cloth. 

For stubborn spots, use a soft-bristle brush. Go over these areas gently and don’t apply too much pressure as you could risk scratching the door. Once all the dirt and grime are removed, wipe the door completely with a damp cloth to remove the soap and baking soda residue. 

Cleaning your stainless steel refrigerator doors doesn’t have to be a chore. With the right products and a few simple steps, you can make your doors look like new again.
