If you're an avid dehydrator user, then you know how important it is to have the right accessories to make your dehydrating experience even better. That's why it's worth investing in the right Excalibur Dehydrator accessories. Whether you want to extend the life of your machine, add additional features or make cleaning and storage easier, Excalibur has you covered with its range of helpful accessories.

The Excalibur Paraflexx sheets are a great addition for any dehydrator user. These sheets are made from a silicon-based material that is non-stick and heat resistant. This makes them ideal for drying delicate fruits, herbs, vegetables and other items that need extra care when they are being dried out. The sheets also come in various sizes so you can get the perfect fit depending on what type of food item you’re dehydrating. 

Another handy accessory is the Excalibur Mesh Tray Inserts which come in three different sizes – quarter size, half size and full size – so they can accommodate whatever task you’re trying to accomplish with your dehydrator. The mesh tray inserts can be used to dry small food items like herbs or spices while still allowing air circulation around them so they don’t stick together during the dehydration process. This will help preserve their flavor and texture throughout the dehydration process without affecting other food items on other trays within the same batch. 

Finally, if you’re looking for an easy way to clean your machine after use then look no further than the Excalibur Cleaning Sponge & Brush Set which includes both a soft brush and a sponge suitable for removing stuck-on food particles from inside the machine quickly and easily without damaging its sensitive components or affecting performance in any way. 

With these great accessories from Excalibur Dehydrators, we guarantee that your next dehydration project will be much quicker and easier than ever before!
