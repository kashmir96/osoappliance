## Here's All You Need to Know About Resetting the Refrigerator 
Doing a reset of your refrigerator can help you troubleshoot existing problems or clear it before repair work. Resetting a refrigerator helps to restore it to its factory settings, fixing any existing issues and allowing for proper diagnosis of any underlying issues. Here's how to do a reset on your refrigerator.

### Step One: Disconnect the Refrigerator
First, you'll need to unplug the refrigerator from the wall socket. This is an important safety step -- and don't forget to remove any other connected sources of power, such as a cable or power bar. 

### Step Two: Locate and Press the Reset Button
Once the power has been disconnected and you are standing in front of the refrigerator, you’ll need to locate the reset button. This can be found at the bottom of the fridge or nearby. Once you press the reset button, you'll likely hear a click as you press it in. Then, you’ll need to let the refrigerator sit for at least five minutes without power.

### Step Three: Reconnect the Refrigerator
Once the waiting period is over, you can safely plug the refrigerator back into the wall socket. Let the refrigerator sit for up to an hour so it can cool down before turning on the switch. 

By following the steps above, you can reset your refrigerator and restore it to its factory settings in no time. Doing so will help troubleshoot any existing problems, or help you set it up for a proper diagnosis of any underlying issues by a professional.
