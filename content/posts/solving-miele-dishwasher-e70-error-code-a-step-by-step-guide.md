## Solving the Miele Dishwasher E70 Error Code
Are you experiencing your Miele dishwasher displaying the E70 error code? Don't worry - the issue can likely be resolved without the need to call in a professional. In this blog post, find out what this error code means and how to diagnose and fix it.


With electronic products, errors can be a huge inconvenience and often require experience in order to tackle. One such error that you may come across with a Miele dishwasher is the E70 code. 

This code may appear for any of the following reasons: 
- The inlet hose filter is blocked
- The sink valve is closed
- The waste water pump is defective

Here is a step by step guide to help you tackle the E70 error code.

1. Begin by checking the inlet hose filter from the water mains. To do this locate the filter at the end of the inlet hose and clean it if necessary.

2. If the filter is not blocked, you will then need to check and make sure the sink valve is open. This should be a visibly open element that facilitates the water to flow into the machine. If this is closed, open it and check that your machine is still displaying the E70 error code.

3. Lastly, if the above two steps did not resolve the issue - you may need to contact a professional such as one of the licensed technicians from our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) - as the problem could be with the actual washing machine such as the waste water pump being defective. 

Although it may feel daunting, with the right knowledge and guidance, you can often find a solution and fix the E70 error code yourself. We hope this blog post has been of help to you! If you require any more assistance or need help with a different error code, please feel free to look through our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
