## Refurbished Air Conditioners - Get Royal Comfort at Princess Auto!

Refurbished air conditioners are quickly becoming a popular option for people who don't want to spend a lot of money on a brand-new air conditioner. Refurbished air conditioners are air conditioners that have been repaired and upgraded at the factory that manufactured them and then resold at discounted prices. They are different from "used" air conditioners, which are sold as-is and often have unknown histories. 

Princess Auto has recently started offering a variety of refurbished air conditioners from top name brands. You can find Energy Star-qualified models that are both efficient and economical.
