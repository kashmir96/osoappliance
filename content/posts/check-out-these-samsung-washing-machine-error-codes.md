## Understanding Samsung Washing Machine Error Codes

Stuck with a Samsung washing machine error code and need help diagnosing what’s wrong? Many washing machine complaints are resolved by a simple fix like emptying the lint catcher or cleaning the filter. But when those solutions don’t work, it likely indicates a bigger problem.Samsung front and top load washers display an error code when something goes wrong. Knowing these error codes can help you quickly resolve the issue, and save you from an unnecessary service call from a technician.

Below are a few of the more commonly reported error codes for Samsung washing machines, and what you can do about them:

- **4E** - this code indicates a problem with the water supply. Make sure the water supply valves on the rear of the washer are turned on, and that the water supply hoses are attached to the correct faucets and not damaged.
- **NF** - this code stands for “No Fill” and means the water supply is not connected correctly or there is a problem with the water supply being shut off correctly. Check the hoses and valves to assure the washer has a proper and secure connection.
- **LE** - this code stands for “Lock Error” and indicates the door or lid is not properly closed. Make sure the door is firmly closed and the lid is properly latched. If a portion of the clothing is stuck in the door, remove it.

It’s best not to attempt to repair a Samsung washing machine yourself unless you are an experienced technician and have the correct tools and necessary expertise. The most permanent solution is to call a qualified appliance repair technician, and you can find one quickly and easily in our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
