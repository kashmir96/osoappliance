## Shopping Smarter for the Perfect Dryer 
Are you in the market for a new dryer but don't know where to start? Shopping for dryers can seem overwhelming, but if you shop by depth you can make sure you end up with the perfect dryer for your needs. Here's how. 

When shopping for a dryer, it is important to consider the depth of the dryer. Dryers come in different sizes and depths, so shopping by depth ensures that the model you choose is the right size for your closet space or laundry room. 

When considering the different depths of dryers, it is important to make sure that you measure the available space in your room before you begin shopping. This will help determine the size of the dryer that you need. Knowing what size of dryer is needed will give you a better idea of the depth to look for when shopping. 

In addition to the physical size of the dryer, you should also consider the features available. This can vary depending on the type of dryer, so it is important to look at the different types available. Depending on your needs, you may want a basic model, or a more advanced model with more options. 

Something else to consider is the energy efficiency of the dryer. The more efficient a dryer is, the less energy it will use and the lower your bills will be. By shopping for an energy efficient dryer, you can save money in the long run.

Once you have an idea of the size and features you need, the last step is to compare prices. You should compare the features and prices of different dryers to get the best deal possible. 

Shopping for a dryer can be easy if you shop by depth. This helps make sure you get the dryer that is the right size for your room, and also has the features you need. To get started, check out our [overview of top appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) and find the perfect dryer for you.
