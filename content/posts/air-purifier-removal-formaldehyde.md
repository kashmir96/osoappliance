Formaldehyde is an environmental hazard that can have adverse health effects. It is found in a variety of products and materials, such as adhesives, insulation materials, paints, and other household products. It is also released into the air from burning fuel and cigarettes. Exposure to high levels of formaldehyde can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, throat and skin, as well as headaches and even cancer.

Fortunately, there are several ways to reduce your exposure to formaldehyde. One of the most effective ways is using an air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. HEPA filters are designed to capture particles down to 0.3 microns in size - small enough for formaldehyde molecules - so it's highly effective at removing them from the air you breathe. Additionally, many air purifiers come with activated carbon filters which are even more effective at removing formaldehyde from the air because they adsorb it onto their surface rather than simply capturing it on a filter media like HEPA filters do. 

It's important to note that while an air purifier can help remove formaldehyde from your home or office environment, it won't completely eliminate its presence - especially if you live near sources of emissions such as factories or power plants or if you have furniture made with pressed wood products emitting formaldehyde into the atmosphere on their own accord. Therefore, it's important to consider other forms of mitigation such as improving ventilation in your home by opening windows regularly or using exhaust fans when applicable, avoiding pressed wood furniture or other materials that emit formaldehyde into the environment when possible or sealing them with low-VOC sealants if necessary and making sure all fuel-burning appliances are properly vented outdoors so any fumes don't enter indoors where people may be exposed. 

By taking these steps along with using an air purifier with a HEPA filter and/or activated carbon filter specifically designed for removing formaldehydes from indoor environments you'll be well on your way towards reducing your exposure levels significantly!
