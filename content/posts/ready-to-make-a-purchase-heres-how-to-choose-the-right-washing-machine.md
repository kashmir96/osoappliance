## Choosing the Right Washing Machine for Your Needs
Making the right choice when buying a new washing machine can feel overwhelming, but taking a few factors into account will help you choose the best model for you. From load capabilities to energy efficiency, understanding the features of a washing machine ahead of time will help ensure you make the right purchase. 

When looking at washers, first consider the load capacity. Depending on the size of your family, you may want to opt for a larger capacity washer. To determine the size of the drum you need, factor in the size of the items you’ll be washing, such as bedding, large towels, and other bulky items. 

You’ll then want to decide if you want a standard top-loading machine, or a front-loading machine. Front-loading models are typically more efficient since they use a reduced amount of water and energy. This option may be more expensive up front, but you’ll likely save more in the long run due to reduced operating costs. 

The type of washing machine you buy should also depend on where you intend to locate it. If you plan to install the machine in a garage or utility room, you should consider a more durable model that is designed for harsher environments. On the other hand, if the washer will be installed in the kitchen, look for one with a sleek front and control panel, as well as one with noise-reducing features. 

Finally, make sure to research features and settings to ensure you have all the features you need, as well as any additional ones you might want. Features such as temperature control and a timer are essential, however you may believe other features such as steam cleaning, and quick-wash cycle may come in handy.
