## Fixing an E20 Error on Your Washing Machine

For most of us, doing the laundry is an unavoidable weekly task. That's why it's frustrating when a washing machine stops working as expected. One of the most common errors on these appliances is an E20 error.

What is an E20 error? It is an indication that there is a blockage or restriction of water flow into the washing machine. This can occur if the hose or tap has a limited water pressure or the water filter is blocked.

In order to fix an E20 error, first check the tap, hose pipes, and filter for any clogs. If these items are clear, you may need to clean the filter and make sure that the water pressure is sufficient to fill the machine.

If these steps do not fix the issue, it's possible that there is a technical problem with the washing machine. If the filter appears to be in good condition and the water pressure is sufficient, it may be time to contact a repair technician to take a look at the machine. Often a technician will be able to identify and solve complex issue that the homeowner could not on their own.

An E20 error on a washing machine can be a headache and even a potential safety issue. If you're unsure what to do, it's best to contact a professional who can test and repair the machine in a safe and effective way.
