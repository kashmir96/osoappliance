## Demystifying Samsung Top Loader Washing Machine Error Codes

Household appliances like top loader washing machines are complex instruments and are prone to sudden breakdown due to a variety of reasons - wrong loading, improper programming and more. As frustrating as these breakdowns can be, there's some good news: most of them can be solved by simply looking up and understanding the error codes.

Samsung top loader washing machines and their error codes are no exception. To help you troubleshoot, they display an error code to indicate what is wrong and how you can proceed to fix the issue. Letâ€™s take a look at some common error codes and how to properly solve them.

If you see an error code SE, this means the motor or the drive belt is malfunctioning. This problem can usually be fixed with a simple reset. Make sure the breaker is turned off for a couple of minutes and then turn it back on. This should help solve the error.

Another common error code is dE, which indicates that the machine door is not locked properly. Check the door and door lock for any foreign objects and make sure it is securely closed. You should also make sure the latch is fixed properly in the machine. If these checks prove futile, you may need to replace the door switch and/or the door interlock, depending on the model.

If you encounter the HE error code, this indicates a high water temperature. The appliance is sensing water temperature that is too high and, to solve it, you will need to lower the temperature of the water. You can do this by connecting a cold-water supply line directly to the washer.

For the uC error code, this means the drum is overloaded with clothes or other objects and the washer is attempting to redistribute them. To fix this, you'll need to redistribute the items evenly in the drum and restart the cycle.

Lastly, the error code dS says the thermistor or temperature sensor is malfunctioning. If this occurs, you will have to replace or reset the temperature sensor to restore functionality.

These are only a few common error codes Samsung washing machines can throw. To help you out if you ever encouter a scenario not covered here, please refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for help.
