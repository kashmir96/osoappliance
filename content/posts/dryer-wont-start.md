If your dryer won't start, it could be due to a variety of reasons. Before you call a repairman, there are a few things you can try to get your dryer running again.

The first thing to check is the power source. Make sure the power cord is securely plugged into the wall outlet and the dryer is turned on. If the dryer is plugged in and still won't start, check the circuit breaker or fuse box to make sure the circuit hasn't been tripped or blown.

Next, check the door switch. This switch is located on the dryer door and must be activated for the dryer to start. If the switch is faulty, it won't activate and the dryer won't start. To test the switch, open and close the dryer door and listen for a click. If you don't hear a click, the switch may need to be replaced.

If the door switch is working properly, you may need to check the start switch. This switch is located on the control panel and must be activated for the dryer to start. To test the switch, press it firmly and listen for a click. If you don't hear a click, the switch may need to be replaced.

Finally, check the thermal fuse. The thermal fuse is a safety device that prevents the dryer from overheating. If the fuse is blown, the dryer won't start. To test the fuse, remove it from the dryer and test it with a multimeter. If the fuse is blown, it needs to be replaced.

If none of these solutions work, it's time to call a repairman. With a few simple steps, you can troubleshoot your dryer and get it running again.
