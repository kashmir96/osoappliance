## Overcoming the Smell of a Dead Mouse in Your Washing Machine

Do you have a stinky smell lingering in your laundry room? Are you unable to track down the source of this strange odor? If so, it's a good bet that you have a dead mouse living inside your washing machine. Not to worry: with a few simple steps, you can have the machine running again without a lingering stench in no time.

First, locate the source of the strong smell - this is likely a dead mouse trapped inside the appliance. To safely remove it from your machine, unplug the appliance and find the access door or panel. The door may be located on the top, back, or front of the machine - depending on the model. Once you open the door, put on a pair of rubber gloves and gently remove the mouse from the appliance.

Once you have removed the mouse, thoroughly clean the inside of the washer to make sure that it is free of any animal remains. Use a brush and disinfectant to clean any area the mouse may have contaminated. Be sure to keep the machine closed until the cleaning process is complete to avoid any pests from entering it in the future.

Finally, reset the washer back to its original settings and plug it back in. A cycle of hot water and a quality detergent should help to remove any lingering odors associated with the mouse. Additionally, you can add fabric softener to the cycle to help mask any smells that may still remain.

A dead mouse in your washing machine may not feel like the most pleasant experience, but with a little effort and a few simple steps you can easily have your machine cleaned and running again. If you find that your washing machine is not working properly, seek the help of a professional appliance repair technician.
