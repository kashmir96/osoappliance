Vacuum cleaner attachments are an essential part of any home cleaning routine. They can help you clean tight spaces, dust delicate surfaces, and eliminate pet hair and other debris from upholstery and carpets. There’s a variety of attachments available for different vacuum models, but some of the most common ones include the following:

1. Crevice Tool: A crevice tool is a slim attachment designed to fit into tight spaces like between the cushions on your couch or along baseboards. It has a narrow head that can reach into corners and hard-to-reach places that are difficult to get with a regular vacuum cleaner head. 

2. Dusting Brush: A dusting brush is great for getting rid of dust from delicate surfaces like blinds, lampshades, bookshelves, and computer keyboards. It has soft bristles that won’t scratch or cause damage to delicate items while still removing dust particles effectively. 

3. Upholstery Tool: An upholstery tool is designed specifically for cleaning fabrics like couches or chairs as well as stairs and car interiors. It has stiffer bristles than the dusting brush so it can lift dirt out without causing damage to fabric fibers. 

4. Pet Attachments: Vacuum cleaners with pet attachments are specially designed for eliminating pet hair from carpets and furniture. The attachment usually consists of rubberized blades mounted on flexible joints so it can reach deep down into carpets to remove stubborn pet hair that may be stuck in fibers or near the baseboard edges where regular vacuums cannot reach . These tools also work well on pet beds, car seats, curtains, drapes and clothing items too! 

5 Extension Wand: An extension wand is perfect for reaching high ceilings or hard-to-reach places like ceiling fans or air conditioning vents that would otherwise require ladders or scaffolding to clean properly. This attachment usually comes in two pieces which join together with a locking mechanism so you don’t have to worry about it slipping off while you work! 

 With these common vacuum cleaner attachments at your disposal you will soon find yourself tackling every nook and cranny in your home with ease!
