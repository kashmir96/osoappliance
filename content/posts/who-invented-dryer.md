The dryer was invented by George T. Sampson in 1892. Sampson was a African American inventor from South Carolina who had a passion for electricity and new inventions. He was the first to patent a clothes dryer, which he called a “clothes revivifier” or “clothes drier." 

Sampson's invention used hot air to speed up the drying process of clothes, which before this invention could take days to air-dry. His machine worked by taking damp laundry from a washing machine and transferring it into an enclosed chamber where heated air circulated around it. The warm air helped to evaporate the water from the clothes and then exhausted out of the machine.

Sampson's invention revolutionized laundry day for many households, reducing the time spent drying clothes from hours to minutes. His invention also made it easier for people to do their own laundry at home instead of having to pay someone else to do it for them, as had been done in previous years. 

Today, dryers are found in almost every household across America and are considered one of the most important appliances in any home. George T. Sampson’s contribution has helped make doing laundry much easier and faster than ever before!
