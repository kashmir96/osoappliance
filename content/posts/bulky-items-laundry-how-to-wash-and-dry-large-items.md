## Bulky Items Laundry: How to Wash and Dry Large Items 
When it comes to laundry, there are some items that just don’t fit in a standard-sized washer and dryer. These bulky items, such as blankets, comforters, sleeping bags and pillows, require a slightly different approach when it comes to laundering. Here are some tips on how to get your larger items clean: 

1. **Sort** - Make sure you sort each item by color and fabric type before washing. This will help keep colors from running during the wash cycle. It’s also important to check for any tears or holes that could be made worse with the agitation of the machine. 

2. **Wash** - The best way to wash large items is in a commercial-sized washer, if possible. If not available, try using two or three regular-sized machines instead of one larger one; this will reduce the risk of tearing due to excess weight in one load. Use cold water and gentle detergents specifically formulated for delicate fabrics or hand washing; these are usually labeled “gentle” or “delicate” on the packaging. 

3. **Dry** - After washing bulky items in a regular machine they may take several hours (or even days) to dry depending on their size and thickness so make sure you read your machine's instructions carefully before beginning any drying cycles.. For comforters and blankets it's usually best for them not be tumble dried because of their size; hang them up outdoors if possible or use an indoor drying rack if outside isn't an option . If you must use your dryer make sure you select air-fluff (no heat) setting as this will help prevent shrinkage . 

4 . **Ironing & Finishing Touches** - Once all components are completely dried give them a good shake out then ironing pressing is suggested for certain fabrics like cotton blends & linens . This will help restore shape & give them back their crispness .

 Taking care when laundering bigger pieces can ensure they last longer while helping keep colors vibrant over time ! Making sure all big items get laundered properly can be time consuming but well worth it in the end !
