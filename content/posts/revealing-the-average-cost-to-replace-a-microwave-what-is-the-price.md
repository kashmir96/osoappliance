## Uncovering the Average Cost to Replace a Microwave

For those in the market for an appliance replacement, the cost can be an important deciding factor. Microwaves prove no different. Knowing the average cost to replace a new model can help maximize your budget and determine whether this is the right purchase for you.

The exact cost of replacing a microwave varies from one store to the next. Replacing a microwave at a retail outlet could cost you anywhere from $100 to $400. Some of the costlier units could even climb up the scale, with some specialty brands asking for as much as $1000. These higher-end models usually feature additional settings and upgraded capabilities. 

On the other hand, you may be able to use online coupons and discounts to find better prices for the same microwave. Shopping around and comparing prices can help you find the right balance between quality and price.

Overall, replacing a microwave oven typically costs between $100 and $400. Of course, you can find many microwaves under $50, with some models costing even less, depending on the features you need. However, if you’re looking for something more advanced, you could invest up to $1000.
