## What is the Bottom Piece of a Dishwasher Called? 

The dishwasher is an integral part of many households for making our lives easier. Over time, we sometimes need to replace certain parts, but not everyone is an expert on appliance repair. When it comes to the bottom piece of a dishwasher, you may be wondering what it's called. 

The bottom piece of the dishwasher is called the spray arm. The spray arm is an adjustable piece of equipment that sprays the dishwashing detergent and hot water throughout the inside of your dishwasher. It helps to ensure that all of the dishes come out clean and spotless after each cycle. 

In order to clean the dishes, the spray arm spins around and sprays the dishwashing detergent and hot water. Sometimes the spray arm will become clogged with grease or other debris and it needs to be removed and cleaned. It is also not uncommon for the spray arm to become damaged over time and need to be replaced. 

You can purchase new replacement spray arms as well as other dishwasher parts from your local appliance store. Be sure to use the correct part that is compatible with the make and model of your dishwasher. It's also a good idea to read your appliance manual to make sure you're installing the part correctly. 

If you're unsure of the type of part you need, the friendly staff of your local hardware store will be able to assist you in finding and purchasing the right replacement part for your dishwasher. 

Knowing what the bottom piece of a dishwasher is called can be essential for proper maintenance and repair. Being educated on the parts of your dishwasher can help you keep your dishwasher running as smoothly and as efficiently as possible.
