## Replacing an Inoperative Oven Light
Oven lights help you keep an eye on your cooking, so when they don’t work, it can be a real nuisance. Fortunately replacing a broken oven light bulb is a relatively easy task and shouldn’t take you very long. Here’s how to do it.

Start by unplugging the oven and allowing it to cool. Then remove the damaged bulb by gently twisting it in a counter-clockwise motion. Having trouble removing it? Grip it firmly with a pair of pliers.

Clean the remaining socket to remove any debris or dust particles. With the socket clean, an experienced electrician can inspect it to check that the oven’s wiring is intact and that everything is in working order. 

Sparkies recommend using incandescent bulbs rather than LED bulbs for ovens as LED lights are typically not designed to withstand the higher temperatures of an oven. Once you’ve decided on the bulb type you’ll need, insert the new light into the socket and twist clockwise to secure it in place. 

Be sure to test your oven light once you’ve replaced the bulb. If the new light does not work, the socket or wiring may need further inspection.
