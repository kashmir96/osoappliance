Sub-Zero refrigerators are some of the highest quality, most reliable fridges on the market. They are known for their durability and energy efficiency, as well as their sleek design. But how much does a Sub-Zero fridge cost? The answer depends on several factors, including size, features, and style.

A basic 20 cubic foot built-in Sub-Zero refrigerator can range from around $4,000 to over $8,000. For larger sizes or added features such as integrated drawers or door panels with specialized shelving options can increase the cost to up to around $12,000 or more. Some of the higher end models can even reach over $20,000 in price!

The cost of a professional installation will also vary depending on your location and specific model of fridge you choose. A typical installation could range from $350-$1,200 depending on the complexity of the job and local labor rates. Professional installers will typically ensure everything is setup correctly so you can enjoy your new Sub-Zero refrigerator right away without any hassle or worry about it breaking down in the future due to improper installation techniques. 

Overall, buying a Sub-Zero refrigerator may be expensive but its superior quality makes it worth considering if money isn’t an issue for you – after all they do boast one of the longest lifespans amongst all other refrigerators available today!
