If you’ve recently purchased an Airstream, you know that it’s a great way to travel and explore the world. But, before you hit the road, you’ll need to make sure that your trailer is outfitted with all the essential appliances. 

The first thing to consider is a heating system. Most Airstreams come with either a propane or electric furnace. Propane furnaces are reliable and cost-effective but require propane tanks for fuel. Electric furnaces are great for those who want convenience but will require an RV power hookup. 

Next up is air conditioning. Whether it's hot summer days or cool nights, having an air conditioner in your trailer can make any trip more enjoyable and comfortable. There are two types of AC units available: roof-mounted and interior wall-mounted systems. Both offer similar cooling capacity but the roof-mounted unit requires less space inside the trailer itself while still providing excellent cooling power. 

In addition to heating and cooling, it's also important to have other appliances like a refrigerator, stovetop, microwave oven, and coffee maker for all your cooking needs while on the road. Refrigerators are designed specifically for RVs so they don't take up too much space or use too much power while still providing plenty of storage space for food items and leftovers alike! For cooking meals on the go, a two burner stovetop or microwave oven should do just fine! And if you're looking for something special to start off each morning right then be sure to check out some of the many coffee makers that are available specifically designed for RV use! 

Finally, there's no better way to stay connected while away from home than with some quality electronics like TVs and radios! Many Airstreams come equipped with built in entertainment centers complete with flat panel TVs as well as DVD players so you can watch movies together as a family during long drives! Plus, satellite radio receivers allow access to hundreds of channels of music from across multiple genres – perfect for those who love music but don't want any commercials interrupting their favorite tunes! 

Overall, there's no shortage of appliances available when outfitting an Airstream – just make sure that whatever items you choose fit both your lifestyle needs as well as budget constraints so that your travels can be both fun and stress free!
