If you’re the proud owner of a Vitamix blender, you’ll know there are plenty of exciting recipes that you can make with it. But did you know that there are also plenty of accessories available for your Vitamix? Whether you’re looking to expand your blending capabilities or just want some handy extras for convenience, here’s an overview of the different accessories that are available. 

The first accessory worth considering is a dry container. This is designed specifically for dry ingredients like grains and nuts, making it easier to make things like flour and nut butters with your Vitamix. This container also has a larger capacity than the standard wet container, so it’s great for larger batches of recipes. 

Next is the wet container accessory – this is great for making smoothies, soups and sauces in your Vitamix. It has a slightly different design to the standard wet containers as its blades are shaped differently to create more efficient blending action. It also lets in less air while blending which helps to keep everything smoother and prevents splashing out of the blender. 

If you want to get really creative with your blenders then why not try out one of the various blade attachment kits? These contain different types of blades such as dough blades or mince blades which allow you to use your blender for specific tasks like kneading dough or mincing meat – perfect if you want to try something new with your Vitamix! 

Finally, if convenience is key then why not get yourself an extra set of bottles? These can be used in conjunction with special lids which turn them into shaker cups – perfect for taking drinks or snacks on-the-go without having to wash out multiple containers every time! 

So there you have it – just some ideas of accessories that can expand your Vitamix usage even further! With all these extra bits and bobs at hand, who knows what delicious recipes will come out next?
