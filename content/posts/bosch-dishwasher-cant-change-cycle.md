If your Bosch dishwasher won’t change cycles, it could be due to a few different reasons. The first thing to check is the control panel. Make sure that all of the buttons are working properly and that the display is lit up. If the display is not lit up, the dishwasher may be in standby mode and will need to be reset.

If the control panel is working properly, the next thing to check is the door latch. The door latch is responsible for keeping the door closed while the dishwasher is running. If the latch is not working properly, the dishwasher may not be able to change cycles. You can try manually pushing the latch to see if it will move. If it does not move, it may need to be replaced.

Finally, if the control panel and door latch are working properly, the issue may be with the dishwasher’s programming. If the dishwasher is not recognizing the cycle you are trying to select, it may need to be reprogrammed. This can usually be done by pressing the reset button on the control panel. If the reset button does not work, you may need to contact a professional to reprogram the dishwasher.

In conclusion, if your Bosch dishwasher won’t change cycles, it could be due to a few different issues. Check the control panel and door latch to make sure they are working properly. If they are, the dishwasher may need to be reprogrammed. If the reset button does not work, you may need to contact a professional for assistance.
