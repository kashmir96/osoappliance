## Learn How to Run Diagnostics for LG Refrigerators
If you own an LG refrigerator, running diagnostics can help you troubleshoot potential problems when you experience an issue with your appliance. In this blog post, we will explain how to run diagnostics on your LG refrigerator.

To run diagnostics on your refrigerator, you'll need to access the Test Mode. To do this, unplug the refrigerator and wait for five seconds. Plug the refrigerator back in. Then, press and hold the “Lightings & Lock” and “Filter Reset” buttons on your refrigerator control panel. Keep both buttons held down until the control panel starts to beep. When the beeping begins, release the buttons. This will put your refrigerator into Test Mode.

Once you have accessed your refrigerator's Test Mode, you can then run diagnostics. To do this, select the “Diagnosis” option from the Test Mode menu. Then, press and hold the “Lighting & Lock” button once again. This will begin running diagnostics. You'll be able to view any error codes that have been detected by the refrigerator's system. At this point, you can use an [error code reference](./error-codes/) to determine the cause of the issue.

After checking any codes that have been detected, it's important to exit Test Mode and restart the refrigerator. To do this, press the “Cool Select” and “Freezing” buttons together for six seconds. This will exit Test Mode and restart the refrigerator.

By running diagnostics on your refrigerator, you can help to identify any potential problems your appliance may have. To learn more about refrigerator error codes, please refer to our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary. This will provide you with in-depth information about each code, allowing you to easily diagnose any issues with your refrigerator.
