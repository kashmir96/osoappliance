## Cleaning Oven Without Chemicals - Is it Possible? 

When you’re responsible for cleaning a household appliance such as an oven, it can be difficult to know how to accomplish this task without the use of harsh chemicals. Keeping your oven in top shape is an important part of any kitchen upkeep, but there are ways to do it without using harsh and potentially harmful chemicals.

The first step for chemical-free cleaning is to figure out what is causing the mess. Many ovens can build up with dirt and food particles that are easily wiped away with a wet sponge or damp cloth. For more stubborn grime, a paste of baking soda and water can easily be applied to help break up caked on substances. Make sure to use rubber gloves to protect your hands from the baking soda and water mixture. 

When dealing with more challenging areas such as the glass on the oven door, a mixture of white vinegar and baking soda works wonders. For tough spots, use a bit of elbow grease to make sure you are removing all of the dirt and grime. Be mindful not to use too much pressure while cleaning; you don’t want to damage the oven in the process.

Once your oven is clean, you can use a few tricks to help keep it looking its best. Try wiping over the interior of the oven with mineral oil or coconut oil at the end of each cleaning. A light spray of lemon juice will help keep your oven free of bacteria and other food particles.

Overall, there are many ways to clean an oven without the use of harsh chemicals. Start by identifying the cause of the mess and using natural ingredients such as baking soda and lemon juice to help break down and dissolve any build-up on the oven surface. With that and a bit of elbow grease, you can keep your oven looking and working its best at all times.
