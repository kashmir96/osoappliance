## Get the Most From Your Electric Microwave Oven
Heating up food quickly and without fuss is made easy with an electric microwave oven. Whether you're reheating yesterday’s leftovers, quick-cooking today's lunch, or preparing a frozen meal, your electric microwave oven is here to help. 

Many electric microwave ovens come with various special features and convenient presets to help you get the best results for whatever you’re cooking or reheating. For example, some ovens adjust the time and power levels automatically so you don’t have to worry about guessing. Others feature special touchpads to help you select from different cooking or defrost options, as well as a timer so you can be sure to get the results you want.

Using an electric microwave oven doesn’t have to be too complicated. All you really need to do is follow the instructions and directions in the owner’s manual. For best results, clean your electric microwave oven regularly and be sure to use microwave safe dishes and utensils. When cooking or reheating, it’s best to use the appropriate setting and to wait a few seconds between intervals. This can help you avoid overcooking or undercooking.

So don’t be intimidated by your electric microwave oven – it really can be used to get impressive results and make cooking and reheating easier. Ready to start getting the most out of yours? Check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) for more tips.
