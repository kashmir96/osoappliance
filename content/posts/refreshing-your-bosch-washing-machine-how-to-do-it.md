## Refreshing Your Bosch Washing Machine

Keeping your Bosch washing machine clean and maintained is essential for ensuring a long and healthy lifespan. Fortunately, the process for refreshing your Bosch washing machine is very simple and easy to do at home. 

The first step in refreshing your washer is to give it a thorough cleaning. Start by unplugging your machine and emptying the drum of all clothing and laundry detergent. Using a damp cloth and a non-abrasive cleaner, wipe down the inside and outside of the washer. Clean the detergent dispensers, filter, and door seal. Remove any lint or dirt buildup from the drum and use a hoover to clear any lint or dust from around the filters. 

Next, you will need to run a refreshing wash cycle. Add a small amount of laundry detergent to the detergent dispenser and fill the machine with hot water. Run a 15-minute cycle on the hottest temperature setting, without any clothing in the drum. This will help to remove any dirt built up in the washing machine, as well as any stale detergent odours. 

Finally, you can prevent your washer from smelling bad in the future. It is best to leave the drum open and the door ajar when the washer is not in use. This will allow any remaining moisture to evaporate, reducing the chance of bacteria buildup. Make sure to regularly check the seal around the door for any buildup and clean it with a damp cloth or brush. 

Refreshing your Bosch washing machine helps to ensure it remains in good condition and performs at optimal levels. Regularly cleaning the detergent dispensers, filter, and door seal, as well as running a regular refreshing cycle, will help prevent bad smells and make sure your machine continues to work properly.
