## Forced Reset: Know What to Do When Your Washing Machine Malfunctions
Havingyour washing machine malfunction can be a stressful and annoying experience. If a reset isn't the solution, it can be hard to know what to do. Fortunately, forcing your washing machine to reset is often an easy solution to most common problems. In this blog, we'll explain how to force a reset of your washing machine.

First off, unplug the washing machine from its power source, wait a few seconds and then plug it back in. Usually, this will reset the machine. If that doesn't do resolve the issue, you'll want to disconnect the power once again and remove any foreign objects, such as coins or keys that might be blocking any of the washing machine parts. Clean out the filter, door lock, and detergent drawer, and then plug it back in.

If these steps don’t work, it is possible that the control board or power supply has malfunctioned. You will then want to look into replacing these components of the machine or seek professional help. Be sure to assess whether a professional repair service is your most cost-effective option.

It’s also important to understand what might be causing the issues in the first place. Before you attempt any repairs, make sure you go through the standard troubleshooting steps — resetting the machine, cleaning out the lint filter, and checking for any objects stuck in the parts — as outlined in the user manual.
