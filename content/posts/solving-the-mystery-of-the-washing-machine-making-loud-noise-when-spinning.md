## Finding the Cause of a Noisy Washing Machine

Ever heard a loud, thumping noise coming from your washing machine during its spin cycle? As annoying as it can be, there could be a simple explanation. The key to solving the mystery of this noise is to identify the cause. Fortunately, with a bit of troubleshooting and some minor repairs, you can likely eliminate the loud noises your washing machine is making—allowing you to once again enjoy peaceful laundry days.

The first possible cause of a noisy spinning wash machine is an unbalanced load. If your washing machine is filled with too few clothes and the imbalance has shifted, the appliance will try to compensate, causing a loud thumping noise. In this case, the solution is simple: add a few more items and balance the load, and be sure to redistribute clothes during the entire cycle. If a heavier item, like a wet towel, is off-center, the load can become unbalanced.

If redistributing your load doesn’t help, then you may need to check the shocks, springs, or other dampening materials that come with your appliance. If these are worn out or damaged, your appliance won’t be able to absorb the energy of its spinning cycles, causing it to make too much noise. Although such repairs require professional repairs, they may be necessary to keep your washing machine running.

If the problems seem to be deeper than just replacing worn out shock absorbers, you may need to replace your pulley, belt, or clutch to stop the loud noises. These parts can wear out due to an abundance of soap or fabric softener, or a buildup of lint or dirt. Additionally, older washing machines do tend to make more noise due to wear and tear.

Due to the complexities of these repairs, it’s best to consult with a professional. Our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) includes a list of experienced professionals to help you find the perfect fix for your noisy washing machine.

With quick troubleshooting and the help of an experienced appliance repair technician, you can easily get your washing machine humming once again.
