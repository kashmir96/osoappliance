## 4 Essential Rules of Kitchen Organization

When it comes to kitchen organization, it's important to know a few simple rules for keeping your kitchen clean, organized, and running smoothly. Whether you're cooking a meal or storing all of your food, having a few basic guidelines can help you keep your kitchen in top shape. Here are 4 golden rules of the kitchen that you need to know. 

### Pre-Planning and Meal Prep Can Help Save Time 

Getting organized in the kitchen doesn't have to take a lot of time. A great way to save time when cooking is to do a bit of pre-planning before you begin. Meal planning and prepping in advance can help you save a lot of time in the kitchen. Take the time to decide what meals you would like to make and come up with a grocery list to make grocery shopping a breeze.

### Keep Food Stored and Organized

The key to an organized kitchen is proper and efficient food storage. Make sure all of your canned, jarred, and boxed food has a designated and consistent storage spot. This will help make it easier to find what you're looking for and put things back where they belong after use. Additionally, it’s important to keep produce stored in a cool and dark place and make sure all of your perishables have a place in the refrigerator. 

### Clean As You Go

As you cook your meals, it's important to clean any messes as soon as you make them. This will help you keep your kitchen clean throughout the cooking process. Taking the extra few minutes to wash your dishes and wipe down your counters will save you from a bigger mess later.

### Rely on Quality Kitchen Appliances

Having the right kitchen tools in hand can make your life much easier. Quality kitchen appliances, such as a good refrigerator, automatic dishwasher, and dependable oven, are essential for any functional kitchen. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when shopping for small kitchen appliances, but knowing what features you need and want can help narrow down your choice.
