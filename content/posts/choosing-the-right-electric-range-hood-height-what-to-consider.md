## Choosing the Right Height for an Electric Range Hood

Cooking is an important part of life, and having the right equipment to do the job is just as important. A range hood is often the overlooked, yet important centerpiece of a kitchen—not only helping to keep the air clean and safe, but also providing a stylish and modern touch. When it comes to choosing the right electric range hood height, there are a few things to consider.

The height of the range hood should be chosen based on various factors, such as the size of the range and the size of the kitchen. For example, if the range is smaller in size, then a lower-hanging range hood is often more suitable. Additionally, the style of the electric range should be taken into consideration—SHOULD it be wall-mounted or island-mounted? The height of a wall-mounted range hood should typically range from 24 to 36 inches from the cooking surface, Whereas an island-mounted range hood is typically installed at a minimum height of 30 inches. 

In addition to the size and style of the range hood, the BTU of the range hood is another factor to take into consideration. If the BTU rating of the range goes up, then the height of the electric range hood should also go up in order to cover all the potential smoke and fumes created while cooking.

So, to recap, when selecting the right electric range hood height, the size of the range and kitchen, the styles of the range hood, and the BTU needs should all be taken into consideration. By keeping these important points in mind, you can be sure to find the right range hood height that suits your kitchen and your cooking needs.
