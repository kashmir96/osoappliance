## Solving the Unpleasant Noises Your Washing Machine Makes
When your washing machine seems to be making loud noise when it is spinning, it can be a cause for alarm. But the good news is, most of the time the loud noise is easily fixable. In this blog post, we will take a look at the causes of the noise and how to solve the problem. 

The most common cause for a noisy washing machine is a worn out belt or a broken drive shaft. When these components become worn, the movement of the agitator or the drum becomes uneven, leading to a clanking sound. To fix this, you'll need to replace the worn parts. 

Another common cause of loud noise is that the shocks and springs that move the washing machine have deteriorated or worn out. This will require replacing those components as well. Lastly, an unbalanced load can cause an off-kilter spin, leading to a medium to loud clanking noise. To stop this noise, make sure the load is evenly distributed when you start the cycle.

If the problem persists after examining and replacing any of the components listed above, it may be time to call a specialist. Depending on the severity of the issue, a certified expert may be able to troubleshoot and solve the problem.

No one wants their washing machine to disrupt the household with its noise. But, with a little bit of detective work and a few replacements, most loud noises can be fixed.
