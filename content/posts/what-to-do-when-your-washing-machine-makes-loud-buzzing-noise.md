## Troubleshooting a Noisy Washing Machine
If your washing machine has recently started making a lot of noise, you may be wondering what to do next. In this blog post, we'll provide a few tips for troubleshooting a noisy washing machine.

One of the first steps you should take when your washing machine starts making a loud buzzing noise is to make sure nothing is stuck in the wash cycle. Check to see if any clothes, fabric softener, lint, buttons, or coins are stuck in the machine. If you can easily remove the item, be sure to do so and then re-start the wash cycle.

If your machine is still noisy after removing any stuck items, you may want to check the spin cycle next. An unbalanced load can cause a washer to make a loud buzzing noise. Try re-arranging the load and restarting the spin cycle.

When these steps don't stop the noise, it may indicate a mechanical issue or an issue with the hose. You can try tightening the hose clamps, or checking the hoses for any signs of wear and tear. If the issue persists, it may be time to call a repair technician.

It's important to address a noisy washing machine as soon as possible. If ignored, the issue may worsen, resulting in additional repair costs down the line.
