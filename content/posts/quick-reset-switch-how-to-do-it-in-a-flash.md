## Flick the Switch and Get Back Up Again with a Quick Reset
Are you trying to reset an electrical appliance, but don't know where to start? You may not realize it, but a quick reset switch could provide an easy solution. Read on to learn how to quickly reset your appliance in a few simple steps. 

When you're troubleshooting an appliance, there are often several ways to find out what's wrong. But sometimes, the easiest solution is to just reset the appliance by hitting the quick reset switch. This switch is a part of the appliance's circuitry and can restore it to factory settings in a flash. 

The quickest way to accomplish a quick reset is to locate the switch on the side of the appliance. It will often be near the power cord and may look like a little red button. Press and hold the button for a few seconds. This should reset the appliance to its default settings and clear any glitches in its operation.

If you don’t have a quick reset switch or it doesn’t work, you can also reset by unplugging the appliance’s power cord and plugging it back in. This will also reset the appliance to its default settings. However, this is not as effective as a quick reset switch as some of the settings or programming may still be saved.
