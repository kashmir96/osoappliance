In today’s world, the kitchen is an essential part of every home. We use it for meal preparation, entertaining family and friends, and for many other activities. As such, having the right kitchen appliances is more important than ever. With so many options on the market, it can be difficult to know which brands are best and have the biggest market share. 

When it comes to kitchen appliances, one of the biggest names in the game is Whirlpool Corporation. This company has been around since 1911 and produces a wide range of products including refrigerators, dishwashers, ranges/ovens, microwaves/hoods and washers/dryers. In 2018 alone they sold over $21 billion worth of products globally! Whirlpool also holds a strong brand presence with a strong reputation for quality products that stand up to years of use. 

GE Appliances (formerly known as General Electric) is another leader in this field with an estimated 16% market share in 2018 according to Statista. The company produces some popular refrigerator models like Profile Series French Door Refrigerator or Cafe Series French Door Refrigerator that include features like built-in water dispensers or smart temperature control systems making them very attractive for consumers looking for convenience in their kitchens. 

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd is yet another major player in this sector with 12% global market share in 2018 according to Statista reports as well as numerous awards from various organizations such as Consumer Reports or Good Housekeeping Institute giving them recognition amongst consumers who value these accolades when shopping around for appliances they can trust will do their job properly year after year without needing repairs or replacements too often due to poor performance or quality control issues common among lesser brands on the market today.. 

LG Electronics Inc rounds off this list at 11% global market share with their various home appliance offerings ranging from refrigerators with auto fill water pitchers included all way through washing machines that offer multi-program cycles meaning customers can tailor each load’s wash settings depending on what type of fabric being washed – giving them superior cleaning results each time! LG also has several award winning products across different categories making them a great choice when shopping around looking for reliable appliances that won’t fail you prematurely due lacklustre build quality.. 

Overall there are many options available when choosing what kind of kitchen appliance you need but these 4 companies make up almost half (47%)the entire global market so it's no surprise why they're considered some most reliable choices out there right now – not only do they have huge brand presence but combined awards & accolades received by their respective product lines back up why they remain top contenders within competitive industry today!
