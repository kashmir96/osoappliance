## Solving Enigmatic F35 Error Code Issues
As a household appliance user, you may have stumbled across the enigmatic F35 error code at least once. The F35 error code is an indication that you may have an issue with your washing machine,, and is likely to cause distress and confusion in households all around the world. 

In this blog post, we'll go over the most common causes for the F35 error code issue, as well as how to go about fixing it yourself, or when to seek professional help. 

The Whirlpool Duet model of washing machine can trigger the F35 error code when it has resistance problems with its motor triac, an electronic component. This can be caused by either a worn out or corroded motor, or by a malfunctioning user control and display board. 

Your first step should be to look over the motor and motor triac. If they look worn out or corroded, they should probably be replaced. In addition, if the user control and display board isn't functioning correctly, it may need to be replaced. 

Another possible cause of the F35 error code is if the temperature sensor in the washer's main control is malfunctioning. This temperature sensor may have a faulty connector, or the wiring itself may have become frayed or broken. Either way, the sensor may need to be replaced. 

The last potential cause of the F35 error code is a malfunctioning steam valve. The steam valve is responsible for controlling the washer's water levels and if it is damaged or not working, it can cause the washer to display the F35 error code. 

Fortunately, you can try to fix all of these causes by yourself. Replacing the motor or user control and display board is relatively simple and should be easy enough to accomplish with some patience and the right tools. If the temperature sensor is faulty, you can replace the connector or wiring, which should also be easy. If, however, you are having trouble with the steam valve, you may need to call in a professional Appliance Repair Technician. 

When faced with a perplexing F35 error code, it's important to take a deep breath and not panic. Identifying the potential causes can be the first step in trying to find a solution yourself, or seek the help of a professional when needed.
