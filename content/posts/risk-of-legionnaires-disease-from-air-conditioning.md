Air conditioning is a common comfort feature in many homes and businesses. Unfortunately, if not properly maintained, air conditioning can be a source of Legionnaires’ disease. Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by breathing in small droplets of water containing the Legionella bacteria. 

The most common way that Legionnaires’ disease is spread is through contaminated water systems such as cooling towers, evaporative condensers, hot tubs, and decorative fountains. However, air conditioning systems can also become contaminated with the bacteria if they are not properly maintained and cleaned regularly. As these systems circulate air throughout buildings, they can disperse droplets of water containing the bacteria into the air where it can be inhaled by people nearby. 

The risk of developing Legionnaires’ disease from an air conditioning system increases when it has not been adequately maintained or cleaned on a regular basis. The buildup of organic matter such as dirt, dust and other debris on cooling coils provide an ideal environment for the growth of legionella bacteria which can then be dispersed into the air. It is also important to ensure that all components within an air-conditioning system are functioning correctly as leaking water pipes or valves can allow stagnant water to accumulate within the system which creates favourable conditions for bacterial growth and proliferation. 

To reduce your risk of developing Legionnaires’ disease from air conditioning systems, it is important to have them regularly inspected and serviced by qualified professionals who have experience in dealing with this type of equipment. Regular cleaning should also be performed to remove any built-up dirt or debris which could provide an ideal environment for bacterial growth. Additionally, any leaking pipes or valves should be fixed immediately to prevent stagnant water from accumulating within your system which could lead to bacterial contamination.
