## Dealing with Range Hood Issues: Tips & Advice

Range hoods are an important part of any kitchen, providing ventilation and improved air flow throughout the space. If you're having common issues such as your range hood not working, making strange noises, or not installing properly, the right advice can help you tackle it quickly and effectively. In this blog, we provide expert advice and tips to help you get your range hood running again.

One of the most common problems with range hoods is improper installation. If your range hood isn’t mounted properly, it’s not only dangerous but also inefficient – it won’t be able to filter and recirculate the air correctly. To tackle this, make sure it is securely mounted, check all connections, and ensure the fan and ventilation system are properly aligned.

Faulty wiring can also be a common culprit for malfunction or strange noises coming from range hoods. Over time, wiring may become damaged, leading to problems with functions such as the lights or fan. If this is the case, it’s best to get an expert electrician or appliance technician in to diagnose and repair any damaged wiring.

Air flow problems are another common issue with range hoods. If your range hood isn’t clearing the air correctly, check the filter, ducts, and fan settings. The filter should be replaced every 6 months - if it’s clogged, this can cause your range hood to run ineffectively. Inspect and clean the ducts regularly, and if necessary ask a technician to check the settings of the fan to ensure it’s running at the right speed.

If your range hood still isn’t functioning as it should, needs replacing, or needs a repair, it’s important to call in the experts.

## Common Questions and Answers About Range Hoods 

1. **What is the purpose of a range hood?** A range hood serves to ventilate your kitchen by removing smoke, odors and grease from the air. 

2. **What is the difference between a range hood and a vent hood?** While the terms are often used interchangeably, range hoods are typically installed directly above a range, stove or cooktop to capture the smoke, odors, and grease produced by cooking. Vent hoods are usually built into the wall and are used to exhaust air from the kitchen.

3. **What is the best type of range hood for my kitchen?** It depends on what type of ventilation your kitchen needs, but the best type of range hood is usually an under-cabinet hood with a built-in fan. This type of hood is capable of ventilating smoke, grease and odors efficiently, and can be installed easily. 

4. **How do I install a range hood?** When installing a range hood, it is important to locate a spot that is closest to the vent location, allowing the capture hood to capture and exhaust the smoke, odors and grease most quickly. Once the hood is in place, you should make sure that the exhaust duct is correctly connected.

5. **What maintenance is needed for a range hood?** It is important to clean the range hood regularly, especially the filters. Grease, dirt and dust can build up on the filters and affect the airflow, performance and efficiency of the range hood. It is also important to keep the fan and motor of the range hood clean and dust-free.
