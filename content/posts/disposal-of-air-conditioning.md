Air conditioners are a great way to beat the heat during summer months, but when it comes time to get rid of your old unit, proper disposal is essential. Improperly disposing of an air conditioner can cause environmental damage, so itâ€™s important to know how to properly dispose of your old unit.

The first step in disposing of an air conditioner is determining if the unit contains any hazardous materials such as Freon or other refrigerant gases. If the air conditioner does contain any hazardous materials, it must be taken to a certified waste disposal facility for proper disposal. Check with your local government or waste management authority for approved waste removal services in your area.

If the air conditioning system does not contain hazardous materials, you can usually recycle the unit through your local recycling center or donate it to charity. Many organizations accept donations of working and non-working appliances and will often pick them up from your home free of charge. Check with local charities in your area for more information on donating used appliances. 

If neither recycling nor donation are possible options for you, contact a scrap metal dealer who may take the old system off your hands and pay you for its weight in scrap metal value. However, keep in mind that many scrap dealers will not accept air conditioning systems due to their size and weight so be sure to call ahead before taking any action. 

Finally, if all else fails, contact a professional appliance removal service who specializes in safe and responsible appliance removal services at reasonable rates. They will come out and pick up the old system from your home and safely remove it from your property without causing any damage or harm to either you or the environment along the way! 
 
Properly disposing of an air conditioner is important both for safety reasons as well as environmental protection reasons so make sure that you always take the time necessary to properly dispose of any unwanted units!
