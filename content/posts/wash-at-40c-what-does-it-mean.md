## Learn What Washing at 40°C Really Means
On any appliance there's a good chance you will see a temperature setting for your wash. If there's just a number such as 40°C then it can be confusing to understand what that actually means and what you should set your appliance to. In this blog we will take a look at what it means when it just says to wash at 40°C and what the differences are between washing at different temperatures.

Washing at 40°C is a water temperature for doing laundry. It is one of the most common washing temperatures that you will come across and is often labeled as "normal" on the dial of your machine. It is the most suitable temperature to get clothes clean while being gentle enough to avoid causing damage to the fabric. 

The 40°C temperature is efficient enough to get rid of any dirt or stains, while at the same time protecting delicate items such as lingerie, wool and silk garments. This temperature is typically used for normal loads of bedding or mixed clothing. It's also the best temperature when you need to be at all confident that every item you wash, is both clean and cared for, so that your whites remain white and your colours remain vibrant.

When using a lower temperature than 40°C for washing, dirt and stains may not be removed thoroughly but on the other hand, using a higher temperature, though it will do a better job of removing dirt and stains, can damage certain fabrics such as wool or silk.

In conclusion, when an appliance gives a simple setting of 40°C it is indicating that this temperature is the most suitable, balanced was temperature. It is an efficient way to get rid of dirt and stains while still being gentle enough to not damage the fabric of any garments. If you have any doubt about what temperature to choose for a specific item then check the care label on the item for the manufacturer’s recommendation.
