If you want to keep your washing machine clean and running smoothly, using the right cleaning products is essential. Cleaning a washing machine can be a daunting task, so it’s important to understand which cleaning products are best.

First, consider what type of washing machine you have. Different types of machines require different types of cleaning products. Top-loading machines, for example, require a detergent designed specifically for them. Front-loading machines typically require an all-purpose cleaner that is safe for use on both the inside and outside of the washer.

Once you know what type of detergent is appropriate for your machine, look for one that is specifically formulated to clean both the exterior and interior surfaces of your washer. It's also important to choose a product that contains enzymes or other ingredients designed to break down and remove residue from laundry cycles past. This will help keep your washer running in tiptop shape while preventing odors from building up over time. 

Your choice in cleaning product may also depend on how often you plan to clean your washing machine and how much buildup has already accumulated inside it. For instance, if there's already some residue present on interior surfaces due to hard water or regular wear and tear, then a specialized deep cleaner may be necessary in order to fully remove it all before applying any other product or solution for regular maintenance purposes. 

Finally, don’t forget about the outside surface of the washer when considering which cleaning products are best suited for it - especially if your model has been painted or finished with plastic coating! A gentle all-purpose cleaner should do just fine here as long as it’s sprayed on sparingly and wiped off thoroughly after use with a soft cloth or sponge - never abrasive materials like steel wool! 

With these tips in mind, you can easily select the right washing machine cleaner suited to keeping yours looking shiny new while operating at optimal performance levels!
