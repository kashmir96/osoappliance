## Unearthing LG's 10 Year Warranty on Washers

Are you considering purchasing an LG washer? Then you'll be glad to know that LG offers a 10 year warranty on many of their washing machines. But, before you make your purchase, you should understand exactly what this warranty covers and what it doesn't cover.

The 10 year warranty applies to LG washers with a part listed as LG Motor Inverter Direct Drive System. This includes the motor and the inside parts of the washer. It does not include the outside appearance components like the latch and door, or any plastic or rubber parts.

If your washer is covered by the 10 year warranty, then you can expect the DC Inverter motor and other parts to be replaced free of charge. It's important to keep your original sales receipt and the serial number of the washer handy so that you can prove your machine is eligible for the warranty.

It's also worth noting that in order for these parts to be replaced for free under the 10 year warranty, your washing machine will need to be used in a residential setting and within the guidelines of the owners manual. Repairs or replacements carried out by a third party or aftermarket parts void this warranty. 

The 10-year warranty on LG washers is a great benefit to customers. If you're in the market for a washer, make sure to check to see if the one you are considering is covered by this generous warranty.

Before you purchase your LG washer, make sure you research what each part is covered by and which parts are excluded from the warranty.
