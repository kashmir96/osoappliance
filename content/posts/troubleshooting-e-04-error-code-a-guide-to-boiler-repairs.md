## Troubleshooting an e-04 Error Code for Boiler Repairs

A boiler is a large home appliance used to heat a dwelling in colder climates. They can be complex and expensive to maintain, so it's important to be aware of any issues that may arise while they are in use. One common error code that can display on the boiler mechanism is the e-04 error code. This code can be difficult to troubleshoot, but understanding the boiler's system can help you solve the problem.

The e-04 error code is caused by a faulty high limit switch. This switch is responsible for detecting when the water in the boiler is too hot, and shutting off the heating element to prevent overheating. If the high limit switch fails, the water in the boiler can reach a dangerously high temperature, and the e-04 error will be displayed. 

To fix this issue, the high limit switch should be replaced. It is recommended to replace the switch with an OEM part from the same manufacturer as the boiler. Installing an OEM part guarantees a good fit and compatible product. In addition, the boiler should also be cleared of any sediment or calcium deposits that could be clogging the system. These deposits can build up over time and interfere with boiler functionality.

Once the new high limit switch is installed, the boiler should be reset and tested. Apply power and check the temperature gauge on the system. If the temperature is in the normal range, then the problem has been solved. 

Troubleshooting an e-04 error code can seem like a daunting task, but with the right knowledge and tools, it can be done quickly and easily. For more trouble shooting guidance check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/).
