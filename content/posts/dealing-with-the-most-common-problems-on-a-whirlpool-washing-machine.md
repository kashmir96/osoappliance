## Common Problems and Solutions for a Whirlpool Washing Machine
Do you own a Whirlpool washing machine? If so, it’s important to know how to handle common issues that may arise. While there are many potential problems that could present themselves, there are a few common issues that many Whirlpool owners may come across.

The most common problems that occur with a Whirlpool washing machine involve starting the machine, draining it properly, and making sure it is properly leveled. If the machine doesn’t turn on at all, the issue could be related to a power issue, such as a tripped breaker, or a faulty outlet. If the machine turns on and off rapidly, it could be caused by a kink in the water hose, a clogged filter, or the load of laundry being unbalanced. If the machine is not draining correctly, it could be related to a blockage in the drain, which can usually be resolved by cleaning the drain hose. Lastly, if the machine is vibrating too much, it could be related to the machine being unbalanced. To correct this, simply adjust the feet downwards until the machine is level.

In rarer instances, the problem could be related to the internal components of the Whirlpool appliance. If this is the case, then it’s a good idea to reference error codes in the appliance, which can be done by referring to our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary. This resource can help to pinpoint any issue that could be related to the internal workings of a washing machine.

Dealing with common problems with a Whirlpool washing machine can be fairly easy, as long as you’re proactive in diagnosing the issue. If the problem persists after trying the previously mentioned solutions, it’s important to investigate further, which can be done referencing our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary. This can help to get your Whirlpool appliance back in running order, and ensure your clothes are getting washed properly and in a timely manner.
