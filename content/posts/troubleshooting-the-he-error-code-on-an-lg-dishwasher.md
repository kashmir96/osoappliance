## Troubleshooting the HE Error Code on an LG Dishwasher
Having an error code appear on your LG Dishwasher can be frightening or overwhelming. The good news is that they are almost always straightforward to diagnose and repair. Here, we explore what causes the dreaded "HE" error code and how you can quickly and easily troubleshoot and resolve the problem.

When your LG Dishwasher displays an "HE" error code, there is a problem communicating between the dishwasher's motor and the machine's main control board. This error code is caused in one of two ways: either voltage from the water heater is incorrect, or a water-heater malfunctioning has caused a fault in the dishwater's motor controller. 

To troubleshoot the issue, first check the power to the dishwasher. If the power is ok, then check that the water heater is working correctly. If the water heater is functioning properly, then check if the temperature is set too high on the dishwater. It's also possible that the motor is malfunctioning and needs to be replaced. 

Finally, it's important to check the wiring harnesses to make sure they are properly connected. This can be done by unplugging the dishwasher's power cord and examining the wiring connection between the hose and the device.

## Troubleshooting the 'HE Error Code' on an LG Dishwasher

**Q: What is an HE error code on an LG Dishwasher?**
A: HE stands for ‘High Efficiency’ error code. When this code appears on an LG Dishwasher, it means there is a problem with the water temperature in the dishwasher.

**Q: What are the common causes of an HE error code?**
A: The common causes of an HE error code include: a clogged inlet valve, a malfunctioning heating element, low mains supply voltage, poor counter-pressure or too much suds, and blocked or kinked water inlet hose.

**Q: How can I check and diagnose the issue?**
A: To diagnose the issue, first check the inlet valve. Confirm that it is not clogged, damaged, or blocked. If it is not, then check the heating element and make sure it is functioning properly and that the mains supply voltage is sufficient. You should also check the counter-pressure and the suds, then look at the water inlet hose to make sure it is clear and free from any kinks or blockages.

**Q: How can I reset the HE error code?**
A: To reset the error code, you will need to take the following steps: unplug the dishwasher from the power outlet, wait for 5 minutes, and then plug it back in. Once the dishwasher has been turned back on, run a drain cycle to help clear out any additional suds or water.

**Q: How can I prevent an HE error code from recurring?**
A: To help prevent the error code from returning, make sure to periodically check your water inlet hose for any kinks or blockages. Likewise, keep an eye on the mains supply voltage, as too low of a voltage can also be a cause of the HE error code. In addition, maintain proper counter-pressure throughout the system and make sure not to exceed the recommended suds level.
