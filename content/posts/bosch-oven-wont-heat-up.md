If your Bosch oven won't heat up, it can be a frustrating issue to deal with. Luckily, there are a few steps you can take to get it working again. First, check the power supply to make sure the oven is plugged in securely. If that doesn't work, try resetting the oven by turning off its circuit breaker and waiting 30 seconds before turning it back on.

After resetting the oven, you should make sure the temperature is set to the correct setting. Also check that it's not on a time delay or kept warm function that could be preventing it from heating up.

Finally, make sure none of the internal parts of the oven are blocked or covered. If something is blocking access to air flow, such as a large utensil, then this could be preventing your Bosch oven from heating up properly. Remove anything that might be blocking air flow and test out your oven again.

Next, you should check the door seal to make sure there are no gaps or tears that could be causing air leaks. If necessary, replace the seal with an identical one from a local home improvement store. Additionally, you can check any switches or heating elements inside the oven and make sure they're in good condition and connected properly.

If all else fails, it's time to contact a professional appliance technician for further assistance. They'll have access to specialized tools and diagnostic techniques that may help pinpoint the problem more quickly and efficiently than what you can do yourself at home. The technician may also be able to offer advice on whether replacing parts or having repairs done will be more cost effective than buying a new appliance altogether
