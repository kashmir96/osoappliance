Microwave convection ovens are one of the most versatile cooking appliances available. They combine the convenience of microwave cooking with the traditional heating methods used in convection ovens to provide an efficient, all-in-one solution for your kitchen. Microwave convection ovens offer a number of advantages over traditional ovens, including faster cooking times and even heat distribution for more consistent results. But just what is a microwave convection oven? 

A microwave convection oven is a combination appliance that combines both microwaving and baking in one unit. It has two heating elements: one that uses microwaves to quickly cook food, and another that uses hot air (convected from an electric fan) to bake or roast food more slowly and evenly than a traditional oven. This type of appliance also typically includes special settings for defrosting, steaming, grilling and baking pizzas.

The size of microwave convection ovens can vary greatly; some models are large enough to replace your existing wall or countertop oven while others are compact enough to fit on your countertop without taking up much space at all. The biggest advantage these appliances offer is their ability to cook faster than standard conventional or microwave only units – they can cut down on overall prep time significantly by combining the speed of microwaving with the even heat distribution produced by hot air circulating around food during baking or roasting processes. 

The biggest downside associated with this type of appliance is its higher price tag compared to other types of kitchen appliances – most models typically cost between $300-$800 depending on size and features included. However, if you’re looking for an efficient way to prepare meals quickly without sacrificing quality then investing in a high-end model may be worth the extra expense as it could save you precious time in the kitchen in addition to providing consistently delicious results!
