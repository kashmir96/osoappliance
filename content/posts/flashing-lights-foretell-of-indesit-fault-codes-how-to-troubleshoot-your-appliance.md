## How to Troubleshoot Your Indesit Appliance Using Fault Codes
Have you ever been puzzled when confronted with a flashing light on your Indesit appliance? Understanding the range of error codes can help you to diagnose and fix the problem, preventing the need for an expensive callout from a repair service.

Error codes can differ from model to model but many can tell you what the issue is, alerting you to the possible causes of errors which you can then resolve or identify for a professional repair.

Indesit dishwashers, for example, will flash a specific set of lights to denote a fault. An illumination of the ‘ANTI-FLOOD’ and 'ELECTRONIC CONTROL' lights indicates a blocked motor clearance. To identify the cause of the fault, you must check for blockages in the internal motor housing or filter, then carry out the necessary remedial work to release the blockage and continue use of the appliance.

Indesit washing machines often display various LED patterns, such as two flashes. This code can range from a defective door catch to an overfilled tank - the exact cause can be identified by the specific combination of lights that are illuminated.

When an Indesit tumble dryer malfunctions, it’s likely to display a number of blinking lights that can indicate faults with the heating element, vent or filter. In this instance, your best solution is to check these components of the appliance, clean or replace as necessary and your appliance should be back to its usual self.

In short, a malfunctioning Indesit appliance may seem daunting but knowledge of the settings’ error codes makes troubleshooting simpler and can save the need for costly interventions.
