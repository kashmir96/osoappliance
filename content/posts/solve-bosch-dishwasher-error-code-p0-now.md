## Resolving Error Code P0 on Bosch Dishwasher
Often times, your Bosch dishwasher may run into some trouble and display an error code. One of the codes you might encounter is P0. This can be an irritating problem, but this guide will help you solve it quickly and easily.

First, look to see if any of the indicator lights are flashing in a particular pattern. This can provide more information about the source of your dishwasher’s problem. If the light is flashing four times, pause, four times, pause, and repeated, this means the error code is P0. The possible causes are a blockage in the water pump, a stuck water fill button, or a faulty control module.

Then, check the water inlet hose to see if it’s properly connected. Make sure the filter isn’t blocked or clogged. Check for any kinks in the hose, and ensure the end of the hose isn’t inserted too far into the standpipe. Inspect the filter and sump for any debris that might be blocking the water inlet.

Next, you should take a look at the wiring from the control module to make sure everything is connected properly. Make sure the wiring isn’t damaged or frayed. If it’s properly connected, check for an issue with the control module by replacing it with a new one.

Finally, if none of these solutions worked, you may want to call a service technician to help you pinpoint the issue. With proper diagnosis and repair, you should be able to return your Bosch dishwasher to proper functioning order. 

Whether you’re looking to repair and error code P0 yourself or need a service technician to help, you can find more detailed information in our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary. Check it out today to make sure your appliance is working like new again!
