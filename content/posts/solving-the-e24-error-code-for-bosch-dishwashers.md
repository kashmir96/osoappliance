## Solving Bosch Dishwasher E24 Error

If you have a Bosch dishwasher, you may have experienced the dreaded E24 error code. An E24 error code indicates a blockage in the drain pump. Fortunately, with a few simple steps, this error can be easily resolved.

To get started, turn off your dishwasher and ensure that all power and water supply valves are shut off. Depending on the model, you’ll also want to unplug the dishwasher. Check the drain hose for any blockage or kinks in the hose. The drain hose should be disconnected and the end of the hose should be clear of any debris. When reconnecting the hose, be sure it is securely attached.

Next, check the filter and look for any loose or damaged components. Open the pump chamber, located just under the dishwasher’s filter. If there is debris or items in the chamber, remove them and clean the area. Sometimes items can enter the drain pipes and cause back-pressure, leading to an error. After cleaning the chamber, ensure that all parts are securely in place before running the dishwasher again. 

If your dishwasher is still presenting the E24 error code, you may need to contact Bosch service for further information about repair or replacement. By following the steps listed above for your Bosch dishwasher, you should have resolution for this error code in no time.
