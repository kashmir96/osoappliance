If you’ve ever gone into a commercial kitchen, you’ve likely seen a large range hood. Range hoods are an important piece of equipment for any kitchen, providing ventilation and air circulation to keep the air clean. But what makes a range hood large?

A large range hood typically has a width of at least 6 feet. The height can vary from 5-10 feet depending on the size of the kitchen and the type of cooking that is done in it. It will also have powerful fans to draw smoke, steam, and other odors out of the kitchen quickly and efficiently. Many models also feature charcoal or other filters to help capture grease particles before they can escape into the air.

The benefits of having a large range hood are numerous. Having one installed helps reduce indoor air pollution by drawing out pollutants like smoke, grease, odors, and more from your kitchen before they circulate throughout your home or business space. It also helps keep your walls free from stains caused by smoke buildup while improving visibility in your cooking area as well as keeping temperatures more comfortable in general due to increased ventilation. Finally, installing one may even reduce energy costs since it takes less energy to ventilate areas with powerful fans than standard ceiling exhaust fans do. 

Overall, installing a large range hood is an excellent choice for any kitchen looking for increased ventilation capabilities that will help keep kitchens cleaner and healthier while reducing energy costs when compared to traditional exhaust methods!
