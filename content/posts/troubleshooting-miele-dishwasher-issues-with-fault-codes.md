## Troubleshooting Issues with Miele Dishwasher Fault Codes

Miele dishwashers are reliable appliances and with regular maintenance, they can serve your family for years. Unfortunately, dishwasher problems can and do occur. Knowing how to troubleshoot your dishwasher and read the fault codes can help you isolate the problem and determine the best repair solution.

Fault codes are the most reliable way of diagnosing issues with your Miele dishwasher. A fault code (often referred to as an error code) is an alphanumeric code which is normally displayed in the center of the LED rotary selector on the front of the machine. By understanding these codes, you can gain an insight into the cause of any issue which is preventing you from using your dishwasher as you usually would. 

The codes generally start with the letter “F” and are then followed by three numbers (e.g. F12). Different codes have different meanings and various assumptions can be drawn according to the combination of numbers which follow the “F”. For example, an “F12” code typically means that the door latch is defective. However, diagnosing fault codes isn’t always so straightforward. That’s why it’s important to familiarize yourself with all the available codes and also be aware of the different interpretation and understanding which manufacturers may have of the same code.

When you troubleshoot with fault codes, it’s important to remember that your first step should always be to try and reset the dishwasher before you consider replacing any parts. After resetting your dishwasher, it’s also important to run a cycle and make sure that the fault code re-appears. If the fault code doesn’t re-appear, then it’s likely that the issue has been fixed. 

If the fault code does show up again then you can begin replacing parts or hiring an experienced and qualified appliance repair technician. If this is your first time working with appliance repair, locating a trusted and experienced technician in your area can be challenging.
