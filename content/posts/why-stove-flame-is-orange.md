When you turn on the stove, you may have noticed that the flame is usually orange. But why is that?

The answer lies in the physics behind combustion. Combustion occurs when a fuel reacts with oxygen, releasing heat energy. This reaction takes place in a flame, which is composed of several different gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor, and nitrogen. When these gases are heated to their combustion temperature (around 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit), they react with each other and emit light. The color of this light depends on the temperature of the flame.

At lower temperatures (around 1,400-2,000 degrees Fahrenheit), the flames are yellow or blue. At higher temperatures (around 2,500-3,000 degrees Fahrenheit) the flames become orange or red. This is why stove flames are usually orange – they’re hot enough for the reaction to produce an orange color.

So there you have it! The next time you turn on your stove and notice an orange flame, you’ll know why!
