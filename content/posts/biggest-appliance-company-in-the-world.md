Today, appliances are a necessity in our everyday lives. Whether it be for cooking, washing dishes, or doing laundry, appliances are an integral part of our lives. That’s why it’s no surprise that the appliance industry is one of the most profitable industries in the world. In fact, according to a report by Grand View Research Inc., the global appliance market size was valued at USD 637.50 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2020 to 2027. 

With so many companies vying for their share of this lucrative industry, it can be hard to determine which company is leading the pack as the biggest appliance company in the world. Fortunately, there have been several studies done on this subject which makes it easier to identify who exactly holds this distinction: Whirlpool Corporation. 

Founded in 1911 by Louis Upton and Emory Upton, Whirlpool Corporation has since grown into one of the largest appliance makers on earth with more than 70 manufacturing and technology research centers worldwide as well as operations in more than 170 countries around the globe. The company produces such popular brands as KitchenAid appliances and Maytag washers and dryers among others and its products are available for purchase through major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot across North America. 

In addition to being one of the most profitable companies within its sector, Whirlpool Corp has also earned praise from customers due to its commitment to sustainability initiatives such as energy efficient products that reduce water consumption while still delivering superior performance levels compared with traditional models. This commitment has helped propel them into becoming one of only four energy star certified manufacturers out there today – further cementing their place not just as an industry leader but also a responsible corporate citizen committed to environmental stewardship along with customer satisfaction excellence standards across all areas within their scope!
