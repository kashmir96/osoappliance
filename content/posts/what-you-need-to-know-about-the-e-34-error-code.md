## What You Need To Know About E-34 Error Codes

E-34 error codes relate to a variety of household appliances including washers, dryers and dishwashers. These errors indicate a problem with your appliance’s water supply or connection, making it difficult for it to function properly. If you are seeing an error code E-34 when trying to use your appliance, it’s important to determine the root cause so that you can take the necessary steps to fix the issue. 

Common causes of E-34 error codes include a faulty water supply valve, blocked or jammed hoses, water pressure that’s too low, clogged water filters and incorrect connections. Before attempting to diagnose and fix the problem, make sure you turn off the power to the appliance to prevent any further damage. Once the power is off, you can then confirm that the water supply valve is open and the water level is high enough to give the appliance adequate pressure. 

Next, check if the inlet hoses are blocked or disconnected, and also make sure to inspect your filters and remove any blockages or debris. Furthermore, if your appliance has been recently moved, make sure that the connections are all secure and properly connected. Once you’ve checked all of these components, you can then turn the power back on and see if the error code is still appearing. 

If you've gone through all the steps above and the error is still persisting, then it’s likely that the issue is a more serious one. It could be that the water inlet valve is faulty and needs replacing, or that you may have to call in an appliance technician to look into the issue.
