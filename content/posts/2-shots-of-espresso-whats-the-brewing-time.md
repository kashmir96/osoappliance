## How Long Does It Take to Make Two Shots of Espresso?

Coffee aficionados and connoisseurs everywhere know the flavor and complexity that comes with a perfect shot of espresso. The process of brewing a two-shot espresso is one that requires both time and technique. Many variables, such as the grind, temperature of the water, bag size, and extraction pressure all affect the moment-to-moment brewing process. 

If you’re using an espresso machine with a traditional steam wand, a two-shot espresso will take between 20 to 25 seconds to make. This means that it’s both critical and challenging to pull a shot of espresso in the optimal time frame. When pulled correctly, the espresso will have a dark golden crema floating on top of a rich, dark, and slick body. 

If you’re using an automatic espresso machine, the process can take between 25 to 35 seconds. With automatic machines, the dose and grind size can be adjusted with the touch of a button. Even with convenience, however, the technique for tamping must still be precise in order to create the desired crema and intense espresso flavor. 

Making two shots of espresso with either method requires incredibly precise timing. If the shot is pulled for too long, the crema can start to take on a reddish color and deep bitterness can present itself. If the shot takes too little time, it may be sour, watery, and lack flavor. 

Whether you’re using an espresso machine with a steam wand, or an automated one, one of the keys to making the perfect two-shot espresso is making sure your equipment is maintained properly.
