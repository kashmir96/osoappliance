## Minimizing Moisture Levels with Dehydrating Agents 
Moisture levels can pose risk to our houses and furniture, as it encourages mold and mildew growth. To combat this, using dehydrating agents could be an efficient and effective way to reduce moisture levels in the home. In this post, we will provide an overview of how to use dehydrating agents in the household so you can minimize moisture levels.

The two main types of dehydrating agents are silica gel packets and activated charcoal. Silica gel packets are small sachets filled with white granules or beads that absorb anywhere from 40 percent to 40 percent of their weight in moisture. These packets are commonly used inside small enclosed electronics and storage containers to keep their contents dry. As for activated charcoal, it has a large surface area that is negatively charged and helps to attract positively charged moisture molecules away from any environment it is placed in. 

Silica gel packets are often placed directly in storage boxes, while activated charcoal is typically placed in small pouches hung or placed in areas with high moisture levels, such as bathrooms or basements. Be sure to adjust atmospheric humidity levels to the right range so dehydrating agents can work optimally. Depending on your needs, you may need a dehumidifier to lower the moisture levels in your home.

Remember that dehydrating agents are not a long-term solution and should be changed or replaced on a regular basis. A good rule of thumb is to replace silica gel packets every one to two months, while activated charcoal should be replaced after one month. Keep in mind that you should check regularly to make sure that your dehydrating agents are in good condition, as they can fail and will no longer be able to absorb moisture. 

By using dehydrating agents and adjusting humidity levels, you can maintain a safe and healthy home by minimizing moisture levels.
