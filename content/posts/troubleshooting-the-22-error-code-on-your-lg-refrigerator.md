## Troubleshooting the 22 Error Code on Your LG Refrigerator

If your LG refrigerator is displaying an error code of 22, this simple troubleshooting guide will help you identify the possible cause and, if you’re capable, take a few basic steps to try and fix the issue. Read on to find out what you can do and then, if you’re in the market for a new appliance, visit our comprehensive appliance error codes glossary to find all the great LG products available.

The 22 error code on your LG refrigerator indicates a problem with the refrigerator’s freezer function. Specifically, it is signaling that the freezer may be too warm - about 25 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. This may be caused by warm food being stored in the freezer, an malfunctioning fan motor, an improper thermostat setting, or a sealed system issue.

If the problem is due to warm food being stored in the freezer, the most logical course of action is to remove or rearrange food to improve air circulation. You can also turn down the freezer temperature setting to -2 degrees Fahrenheit to prompt the freezer to cycle on and cool down.

If the problem is a malfunctioning fan motor, you may need to call a technician if you are not confident in your abilities. This problem is caused by a faulty evaporator fan motor and requires professional replacement for safe and effective repair.

If the problem is due to the thermostat setting, make sure the thermostat is set to the correct coolness level by referring to the freezer’s user manual. If the thermostat is already set correctly, it is possible that the thermostat itself is malfunctioning and will require professional repair or replacement.

Finally, if the problem is caused by a sealed system issue, the freezer may not be getting proper airflow and cooling, meaning the refrigerator’s cooling system needs more gas or oil. This is a more complicated repair and typically should be handled by a professional.

Troubleshooting the 22 Error Code on your LG refrigerator may seem overwhelming, but there are a few basic steps you can take to help identify and, if possible, fix the issue.
