## Diagnosing Your LG TV Appliance

When it comes to dealing with tech issues, running a diagnostic on the appliance in question can often be the best first step. With LG televisions, there are a few important steps you'll want to consider in order to get your appliance running up to par. Diagnostic strategies, such as LG TV's Live TV Self Diagnosis and Automatic Sound Test, can lead you in the right direction in identifying and resolving any issues you may encounter. 

The Live TV Self Diagnosis upon activating your LG TV can enable you to access program info, picture and sound quality, and even a list of various hardware components and ports available. Through this feature, you can quickly view and assess your system's functionality and make any necessary adjustments. In addition, the Automatic Sound Test can be useful in making sure that all of your external audio components such as sound bars and receivers are functioning properly. This will also allow you to confirm if the system is outputting sound correctly and that no external audio equipment is causing problems. 

When running a diagnostic on your LG TV appliance it's always important to be thorough and ensure every step is being taken for the best assessment of the system. Diagnostic checks such as Self and Automatic Sound tests can be a great way to detect any hardware and software problems so you can begin to fix them and get your LG TV up and running as intended.
