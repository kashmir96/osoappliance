## What Affects the Quality of Your Stainless Steel Appliances?
Stainless steel appliances offer a stylish, modern look for any kitchen. But if you want to maintain its lustrous appearance and overall performance for years to come, it’s crucial to practice the right cleaning methods. Cleaning with the wrong materials or products can lead to scratches, discoloring, or damage. Here’s what you should not clean stainless steel with, and what supplies and methods to use instead.

### Abstain from Abrasive Materials and Products 
When scrubbing your stainless steel, stay away from any materials or products that will be abrasive. Scouring pads and steel wool in particular are notorious for causing scratches or markings in the surface. Even abrasive sponges can be damaging and may leave marks—stick to soft, non-abrasive materials and sponges for a clean and safe result.

### Avoid Harsh Chemicals and Cleaners
Often, people want to reach for any cleaner available to wipe down a messy surface. Unfortunately, this can be a bad decision when talking about stainless steel. Many chemicals and cleaners contain ingredients like bleach or ammonia, which can alter the hue of the material and damage the surface of your appliance. If a chemical cleaner must be used for a more heavy-duty cleaning job, it’s best to test it in an inconspicuous area first.

### Don’t Allow Stains to Dwell
Like many materials, stainless steel can be prone to staining. Don’t allow these staining agents to remain on the surface of your appliance—time is of the essence in removing them. Oil spots can be particularly cumbersome to clean and may require a bit of elbow grease, but it’s important to eliminate these spots as soon as possible. Otherwise, they can accumulate into unappealing streaks and smears over time, which will lessen the beauty of your stainless steel appliance.

### Stick to Soap and Water, or a Mild Detergent
When it comes to cleaning stainless steel, sometimes the simplest methods are the most effective. Warm water and a gentle soap should be your go-to solution for a basic cleaning. Finally, if your appliance requires a bit of extra effort, use a mild detergent (or a designated stainless steel cleaner) instead of harsher products.

When it comes to stainless steel appliances, don’t make the mistake and choose the wrong supplies or cleaners! Abstain from abrasive materials and products, avoid harsh chemicals and cleaners, don’t allow stains to settle into the material, and stick to using soapy water or a mild detergent.
