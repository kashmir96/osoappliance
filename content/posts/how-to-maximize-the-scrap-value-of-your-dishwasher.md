## Maximizing the Return of Your Dishwasher

When you’re ready to replace your dishwasher, you want to get the most value out of it before it’s officially retired. With the right approach, you can maximize the scrap value of your dishwasher and use it to invest in a brand-new model. Here are some of the best strategies to maximize the scrap value of your dishwasher.

The most important thing you can do is have the dishwasher serviced regularly by a [professional appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). This helps keep your dishwasher running quickly and efficiently and prevents major issues from forming before you’re ready to part with it. Regular maintenance also increases the value of your used dishwasher when you finally take it to a scrapyard or resell it secondhand.

Before bringing the dishwasher to a scrapyard, disassemble it so that the moving parts can be reused. Many of these parts can be sold on their own, giving the dishwasher scrap value beyond just being recycled. Doing some research on current scrap prices for dishwashers will also help you know if you’re getting a fair price for your model.

Finally, if you decide to resell your dishwasher instead of scrapping it, consider cleaning and updating its aesthetic before listing it. Give the dishwasher a thorough clean and, if necessary, apply a coat of paint to make it look like new. You may need to take parts and pieces off to paint them, but the extra effort will help you get the best possible resale price for your dishwasher.

With the right strategy, you can maximize the scrap value of your dishwasher and make the most out of its use before you upgrade. Make sure to practice good maintenance habits and service your dishwasher regularly to ensure it’s in good condition when you take it to a scrapyard or list it for resale.

## Maximizing Dishwasher Scrap Value

1. What kind of scrap metal do dishwashers contain?

Dishwashers generally contain a variety of metals, including scrap steel, copper, aluminum, and sometimes brass.

2. Can I take my dishwasher to recycling centers?

Yes, you can take a regular residential dishwasher to most local recycling centers that accept scrap metal for recycling. It is also possible to drop off your dishwasher for recycling at a waste management facility or you can contact a scrap metal dealer to arrange for pickup and to receive payment for the scrap value of your dishwasher.

3. How do the recycling centers calculate the scrap value of my dishwasher?

The scrap value of your dishwasher depends on several factors including the type of metal it contains and its weight. The overall quality of the metals that make up the dishwasher can also have an impact on its scrap value.

4. Is there any way to increase the scrap value of my dishwasher?

You can increase the scrap value of your dishwasher by taking it apart and separating the different types of metals it contains. Metal recyclers typically pay higher rates for specific metals so separating them can result in a higher scrap value.

5. How else can I use my dishwasher after I’ve maximized its scrap value?

If you don’t have a scrap metal recycler near you, then you can still get some use out of your dishwasher by using its parts as DIY materials for other projects or selling the parts as used materials on sites like Craigslist or eBay.
