## Basics of Using a Gas Stove
Using a gas stove can seem intimidating at first, but it is one of the most reliable, efficient and cost-effective ways to cook! Learning how to use a gas stove correctly is essential for any household appliance user, so here are some tips for mastering the basics of your gas stove.

When first turning on the gas stove, it is important to remember to open the window and begin to light the stove from a distance. Igniting the stove with a lighted match or a lighter is usually the most simple and safe technique. The flame should turn blue, indicating that the gas is burning correctly. If it doesn't ignite after several attempts, turn the gas off and check your connections.

Once you have successfully ignited the stove, adjusting the flame is an important part of using your gas stove. A blue flame indicates a top temperature, while a yellow flame at the base of the burner means temperatures are low. Medium temps will give you a combination of the two. After you have found that perfect temperature setting, then you can cook your food!

If at any time you have the gas burner on and the flame goes out, turn off the gas immediately and start over. Also, be sure to turn off the gas valve when not in use and make sure no flammable materials are near the stove.

Using a gas stove is a nifty way to cook! With a little bit of practice and care, you can become a master chef in no time. If you experience any difficulty setting up, operating, or replacing your gas stove, our directory of appliance repair technicians can help.
