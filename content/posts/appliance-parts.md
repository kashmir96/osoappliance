Appliance parts are an essential component to the successful functioning of your household appliances. From refrigerator shelves and oven knobs to washing machine pumps and dryer lint filters, appliance parts are what keep your home running smoothly. Knowing a little bit about the different types of appliance parts available can help you find the right ones for your specific needs. 

The first type of appliance part you should consider is electrical components, such as switches, circuit boards, timers, and thermostats. These components regulate how electricity flows through the appliance and help control its performance. You will also need to purchase replacement power cords or extension cords that connect to your wall outlet. 

Other common types of appliance parts include door seals, shelves and drawers, knobs and handles, coils and gaskets, vents and filters, cleaning supplies such as brushes or wipes for ovens or dishwashers. Additionally you may need a variety of small hardware items like screws, bolts washers etc. In some cases you may find that you need specialized tools such as wrenches or pliers in order to replace certain parts properly. 

Finally it’s important to remember that some models require special OEM (original equipment manufacturer) replacement parts which may not be available elsewhere at regular stores or online retailers; if this is the case with your model then it’s best to reach out directly to the manufacturer for assistance in finding those specific pieces needed for repair work on your device. Knowing all these different types of appliance parts can help make sure that a breakdown of one doesn’t leave you stuck without a fixable solution!
