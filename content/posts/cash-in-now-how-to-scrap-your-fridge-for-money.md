## Scrap Your Fridge for Easy Profit 

You don't have to throw away your beloved fridge when it starts to become outdated. There is easy money to be made if you decide to scrap it for parts. Not only will you get some extra cash in your pocket, but you can also help the environment by recycling rather than throwing stuff away.

When you decide to scrap your fridge, the process can be overwhelming. You need to consider if it would be better to have it dismantled professionally or if you're going to do it yourself. 

If you're brave enough, taking on the job of dismantling your fridge and selling the parts individually can be a great way to put some extra cash in your pocket. Fridge parts tend to be in high demand and can fetch a good price when sold online or to an appliance repair shop. You may even have some parted out that hasn't seen the inside of a recycling centre in years.

When it comes to the actual scrapping process there are a few rules to keep in mind. The first is to be aware of the fact that certain parts like the compressor, motor and condenser contain heavy metals and may be subject to specialized rules and regulations when it comes to disposing of them. Additionally, it's important to properly dispose of any hazardous material like coolants or oils.

When it comes to selling your scrap, it's also important to keep safety in mind. If you plan to part out the fridge, itâ€™s a good idea to label each part with a part number and condition to avoid any misunderstanding when it comes to pricing. It's also recommended to clean off any corrosion or dirt from the parts, as this can result in a much better price.

Additionally, make sure to put a fair price on what you are selling. Too low of a price and you aren't making the most of your scrap, but too high and you risk people not wanting to buy what you have. Taking the time to properly research the market can help you set prices to maximize your profits and make sure you don't miss out on any potential buyers.

Scrapping your refrigerator for money is not only an easy way to make some extra cash, but it also helps to keep potentially dangerous materials out of the environment. Taking the time to properly prepare and price your components can also ensure you make the most of your scrapping efforts.
