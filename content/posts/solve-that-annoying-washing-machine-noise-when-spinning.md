## Quiet Those Noisy Washer Spins
If you’re hearing grumbling and growling coming from your washing machine during spin cycles, it’s time to look into a repair. Washing machines can produce loud noises when they start wearing out or have some loose parts. All this can easily be repaired or replaced if you call in a washing machine service tech. 

The most common contributing factors to a noisy spin cycle are typically worn or unbalanced bearings, a damaged tub or a loose unbalanced drum. The bearings and tub will most likely need to be replaced and the drum can often be balanced by adjusting the legs of the washing machine. A service tech will take the right steps to diagnose the underlying cause of the problem and make the necessary repairs.

As soon as you notice any unusual noise while the washing machine is in the spin cycle, you should call in a washing machine service tech. Waiting too long can allow the problem to worsen, causing more damage and more expensive repairs. Act quickly and don’t let the noise get too out of hand before you call in professional help.

At the end of the day, it’s important to take care of your washing machine and have it serviced regularly for optimum performance. Regular maintenance and tune-ups can help prevent uncomfortable and loud noises from affecting your home life.
