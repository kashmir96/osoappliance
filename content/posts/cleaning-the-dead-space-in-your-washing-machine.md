## Keeping Your Washing Machine Clean and Working Properly
Having a washing machine is a great convenience for many of us, but if you don't take care of it, then it may break or stop functioning properly. Cleaning your washing machine will not only help it last longer, but also help it continue to give you the best washing performance. One often neglected area is the dead space in your washing machine, and this is why it's important to clean it out every once in a while.

The dead space in your washing machine is the area between the outer tub and the inner drum. It is often difficult to reach and easy to forget, which can lead to dirt, lint, and other materials collecting there over time. Failure to clean the dead space can cause your washing machine to become unbalanced, and the collected materials can eventually make their way into your clothes, leading to discoloration or other damage.

Fortunately, cleaning the dead space in your washing machine is relatively simple. You should first use a vacuum cleaner to get rid of most of the dirt and other particles that may have accumulated there. After you've done that, run a cycle with a cup of vinegar and a cup of baking soda inside the washer. This vinegar and soda solution will help remove any remaining dirt and debris, and keep your machine running smoothly.

Finally, you can use a soft cloth to wipe the inside of the machine and remove any remaining dirt, lint, and grime. This will help your machine look and smell better, as well as help it last longer, so you won't have to worry about replacing it in the near future.

By taking the time to clean the dead space in your washing machine, you can help ensure it continues to operate properly and efficiently. With regular cleanings, you can have confidence that your washing machine is working the best it can in order to give you the best performance. If problems do arise, it is important to contact a qualified technician to diagnose the issue and provide repairs if needed.
