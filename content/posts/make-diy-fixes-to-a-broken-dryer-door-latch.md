## Repair Your Broken Dryer Door Latch Yourself
Dryers have many helpful features and it can be inconvenient when one of them fails. A broken dryer door latch can be especially irritating and inconvenient as it will stop the dryer from operating properly. Read on for instructions for repairing your dryer's door latch yourself.

The first thing you should do before attempting to repair your door latch is to turn off the dryer at the circuit breaker in order to ensure you donâ€™t get a shock while working. After switching off the power to the dryer, you can then locate the door latch and inspect it.
 
Depending on the type of dryer and model you have, the door latch may be accessed by removing a panel inside the dryer, or the door may need to be removed in order to access it. If the latch assembly can be removed, you should be able to loosen the screws that hold it in place.

Once the door latch is accessible, you will need to inspect it for damage. If the problem is simply with a loose or stuck latch, the part can usually be tightened with the screws, without the need to replace the part. If the latch has broken parts or any other visible damage, it will need to be replaced before the dryer can be used again.

Finally, to complete the process, you can reassemble the dryer and test the latch by running the machine. If it appears that the latch has been successfully repaired, turn on the power at the circuit breaker and then run a regular drying cycle to make sure the problem has been resolved.

In summary, a broken dryer door latch can be repaired on your own with a few simple tools and some patience. It's important to turn off the power to the dryer before attempting any repairs, and to use caution when doing so.
