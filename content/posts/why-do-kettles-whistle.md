The whistle of a kettle is one of the most iconic sounds of home, and for good reason. But why do kettles whistle?

Kettles are designed to whistle when the water inside has reached boiling point, commonly 100°C (212°F). This occurs because when water boils at this temperature, it produces steam which can't escape through the spout or lid of the kettle. Instead, it builds up pressure inside and forces its way out through a small hole in the lid. The steam is pushed through this hole and a tiny vibrating diaphragm attached to it creates the whistle sound that we all know so well.

The idea behind having a kettle that whistles is to alert users that their water has reached boiling point and is ready for use. This means you don't have to constantly check your kettle or wait for an electric indicator light – you just know when it's done! It's also useful if you're away from your kitchen when heating your water, as you'll be able to hear it from another room and not worry about leaving anything on too long.

So there you have it – kettles whistle because they are designed to alert users when their water has reached boiling point! Next time you hear one go off, remember what amazing engineering feat lies behind its simple but effective sound!
