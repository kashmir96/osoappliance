## Troubleshooting Your Broken Washing Machine 
If you have a broken washing machine, it can be a stressful situation. But the fix may not be as complicated as you think. With a few key troubleshooting tips, you can save your clothes and get your washing machine up and running again in no time.

If your washing machine is making strange noises, you’ll want to take a few steps to isolate the problem. Start with unplugging the machine and manually shifting the drum around to see if it disrupts the noise in any way. You should also check any small vent or grates for any objects that could have lodged themselves in there and causing a rattle. After you’ve checked for those things, you can plug the machine back in and try the cycle again. If the noise persists, the next step will be to remove any dryer sheets, metal clasps, coins, and other materials that may have gotten caught in the pump filter. 

If the machine just isn't turning on at all when you turn the timer, then you've got an electrical issue on your hands. To isolate the issue, check the plugs and wall outlets, as well as the wall switches. You can also check the circuit breakers to make sure that they are all in the on-position and not the tripped position. If all these troubleshooting steps don’t work, you may need to call in a professional to look at the more specialised components of the machine like the main control board or timer. 

It is possible to fix your washing machine and save your clothes from being ruined. With a few easy steps, you can troubleshoot and identify the source of the problem, making for a much calmer home life.
