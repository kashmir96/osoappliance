## A Guide to Understanding Samsung Dishwasher LC Error Code 
Getting an error code on your dishwasher can be a bit disheartening, especially when you donâ€™t know what it means. This guide will explain what the LC error code on Samsung dishwashers actually is and how to fix it. 

The LC error code occurs if the customer is using a low flow or low pressure faucet when attempting to start the dishwasher. The dishwasher requires a set minimum water pressure to work properly and a low pressure faucet will not meet the requirements. Luckily, this is an easy fix - all that is required is increasing the water pressure at the faucet. If your faucet does not have a pressure adjusting function, a booster pump for the water source can be installed.

With the proper water pressure in place, the dishwasher should be able to start. However, if the LC error code continues to appear after boosting the water pressure, other issues may need to be addressed. It is possible that there is the presence of a kinked hose, a clogged filter, or a malfunctioning water inlet valve. 

If any of these additional issues are present, we recommend seeking support from a professional appliance repair technician. This certified technician can properly diagnose the issue and provide lasting repair services. 

In conclusion, the LC error code on Samsung dishwashers indicates that there is an issue with the water pressure at the faucet. This can be remedied by either increasing the faucet pressure or by installing a booster pump. However, if the LC error code continues to persist, other issues may need to be addressed. For this, we recommend enlisting the help of our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to ensure that your dishwasher is working properly.
