## Solving Washing Machine Error Codes

Nowadays, Samsung washing machines are quite prevalent and provide users with innovative features to make laundry a breeze. But even top-of-the-line products can have trouble sometimes, and when they do you may be met with an intimidating error code. Here, we discuss some common error codes and how to tackle them.

Error code 3E appears on top-loader washers and means that the water level is too low. To address this type of error code, check the faucets to ensure the hoses are open, and then check the filters in the hoses to make sure nothing is clogging the openings. If everything checks out, the user can then reset the machine and restart the cycle.

Error code, 4E, is a show stopper and rarely happens. This indicates the washer cannot fill with water and may be caused by a loose hose or a clogged water inlet valve. To address this issue, check the hoses to ensure they are connected securely and clear any blockages inside the water inlet valve.

Error code LE appears during a cycle and indicates that the motor is overloaded. To address this, it is recommended to redistribute the load evenly and try running the cycle again. Users can also pause the cycle and restart the washer to see if that helps.

Error codes SE and 5E are the most common and usually arise when the washer is not draining properly. SE is displayed before the cycle while 5E is displayed during the cycle. To address these errors, check the drain hose and make sure there are no clogs or kinks in it. It is also important to check the drain pump filter as it may be clogged, which causes water to build up. When this happens, it is recommended to Clean the filter and then restart the cycle.

In summary, Samsung washing machines are powerful and reliable appliances but like all machines, you may encounter an error code from time to time.
