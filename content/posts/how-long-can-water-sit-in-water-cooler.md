Water coolers are a great way to have access to cold, refreshing water throughout your day. But like with any appliance, it’s important to take proper care of it and maintain good hygiene. This includes making sure that the water in your water cooler is fresh and safe to drink. When you don’t change the water in your cooler regularly, bacteria can start building up and potentially make you sick. So how long can you leave the same batch of water in your cooler? 

The general rule of thumb is that you should replace the water every 3-4 days or when it starts tasting stale. This will depend on how much you use the cooler and how often you clean it out – if more people are using it frequently, then replacing the water every few days is best practice. Be sure to also clean out any residue inside the tank as well as wipe down the outside with a damp cloth each time you empty it – this will help remove any bacteria buildup and keep everything sanitary. 

If there are periods where nobody is using the cooler for an extended period of time (for example, if everyone’s away for vacation), then emptying out all of its contents completely before storing would be ideal. This ensures that no bacteria or other contaminants build up while not in use and that no stale taste lingers when everyone returns back from their break. 

Overall, keeping your water fresh by replacing batches every few days or so will help ensure that everyone who drinks from it stays healthy and hydrated!
