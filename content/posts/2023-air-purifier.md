As air pollution continues to worsen, the need for air purifiers is becoming more and more evident. An air purifier is an appliance designed to cleanse the air in a room or building from potentially harmful airborne particles and gases. In 2023, we can expect that these devices will be even more advanced than they are now. 

First of all, many of the top brands are expected to offer a wide range of different sized air purifiers. This will give consumers the ability to choose a device that fits their specific needs and budget. Additionally, we can expect that these devices will be much quieter than current models due to advances in noise-canceling technology. 

Furthermore, 2023 models are expected to feature sensors which monitor indoor air quality levels in real time. These sensors allow users to track their indoor environment and make sure it stays healthy by adjusting settings accordingly based on what they measure. The most advanced of these devices may even have some form of artificial intelligence which allows them to adjust settings automatically when needed without human intervention! 

We can also anticipate that advances in filtration technology will significantly increase the efficiency at which these devices remove common pollutants from the surrounding environment such as smoke particles, dust mites, mold spores and other allergens. Some high-end models may even use carbon filters for additional odor reduction capabilities as well as HEPA filters for removing very fine particles from the atmosphere including pollen and pet dander! 

Finally, 2023's top brands are likely going to offer their customers a variety of options when it comes controlling their device remotely via mobile app or voice commands through virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Home Assistant . With this level of convenience users no longer need worry about manually changing settings on their device every day; instead they’ll be able just tell it what type setting they want with ease! 

Overall, by 2023 we should see improved performance compared with today’s models due both advances in filtration technology as well as added convenience features such as automatic sensor readings and remote control capability via voice command. This means better overall performance while still being accessible enough for any user regardless of tech savvy!
