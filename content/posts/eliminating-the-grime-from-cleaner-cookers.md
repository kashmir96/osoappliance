## Keeping Cookers Clean for Improved Hygiene
Keeping your cooker clean is essential to good hygiene and food safety. No matter how often you use your cooker, grime and grease can quickly accumulate, making it difficult to keep it looking and smelling nice. Fortunately, with the right cleaning methods and products, you can quickly eliminate the grime from cleaner cookers. 

Start by preheating your oven to 120°C and removing any food, grease and grime using plain warm soapy water and a cleaning cloth. Endeavor to use a scouring pad only on burnt-on food, as it can damage the enamel finish. Once this is finished, use a baking soda paste to remove any tougher stains. To make the paste, mix baking soda and warm water. Use a cloth to apply the paste and leave for 10 minutes before rinsing with a damp cloth. This should begin to break down the tough grime.

To finish the job of eliminating the grime from cleaner cookers, use a sacrificial cloth or a steam cleaner to give the surface an additional level of cleanliness. These items are affordable and can be used to wipe away stubborn stains and grease. Similarly, use an acid-free cleaner to target any limescale and stubborn grease in the cavity of the oven. Once the steam cleaner or acid solution has been applied and removed, rinse the surface of the cooker with cool water. 

When it comes to keeping your cooker clean and hygienic, it is important to follow these steps often to keep the grime away. Regular preventative cleaning can prolong the life of your cooker and help you maintain a clean and healthy environment.

##Tips For Eliminating Grease and Grime From Your Cooker

1. **What are the steps for cleaning a cooker properly?**
 
 First, unplug the cooker from the power source. Remove all the removable parts and items, such as the trays, racks, and knobs. Thoroughly scrub the removable pieces with a degreaser and a clean cloth or sponge. Be sure to remove any food particles, dirt, or burning marks. Place the removable pieces in a container with warm water and a degreaser and let them soak for about an hour. After the soaking, take each item out of the water and scrub clean before drying. For the cooker itself, use a cooker-safe cleaner and a clean cloth to wipe it down. Make sure to get into the corners and edges.

2. **How often should I clean the exterior and interior of my cooker?**

It is recommended that you clean the exterior of your cooker monthly using a soft, damp cloth and appliance cleaner. The interior should be cleaned at least once every three months, but more frequently after heavy usage.

3. **How do I remove burnt-on grease from the cooker?**

If your cooker has some burned-on grease, you can use a degreaser to dissolve it. Apply the degreaser directly onto the grease and let it sit for several minutes. Then, use a sponge or cloth to scrub the surface.

4. **Can I use some everyday household items to clean my cooker?**

Yes, you can use some everyday items to help clean your cooker. Baking soda and white vinegar are both effective cleaners.
