## Is Your Dryer Fuse Blown? Here's How to Find Out

Are you having trouble with your dryer? A blown fuse may be the culprit. You should know how to check if it is blown quickly, with minimal effort. This guide will explain what you need to know to test your dryer fuse. 

The first indication that the fuse may be blown is that the dryer won’t start up. A blown fuse will prevent any electricity from getting to the dryer’s motor. The fuse is usually located in the dryer’s terminal box. You’ll need to remove the box’s cover in order to get to it.

Next, you’ll want to unplug the power cord from the outlet, as well as the wires connected to it. Inspect the fuse to look for signs of damage, such as a break in the wire. If the internal fuse is the problem, the wires that make up the circuit will be melted. 

To ensure that the fuse isn’t just loose, you’ll want to take a voltage meter and use it to check the continuity of the circuit. If it measures zero, then the power has been cut off, meaning the fuse is definitely blown.

Once you’ve determined that the fuse is blown, you’ll need to replace it. Make sure to use the same type of fuse, especially if it’s a specialised size. Double-check that the power output of the fuse is optimal for the dryer.

Testing the fuse in your dryer is an easy and important step in keeping your family and home safe during appliance use. Once you’ve checked the fuse, if you’re still having issues with your dryer, please take a look at our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to help find a solution.
