Air filters are an important part of home HVAC systems. They help to remove pollutants from the air, keeping you and your family safe from potentially hazardous airborne particles. There are a variety of air filters available on the market, each designed for different needs and requirements. Here’s a look at some of the most common types of air filters: 

1. Fiberglass Air Filters: These disposable fiberglass air filters are one of the most affordable options available, often costing less than $10 per filter. While they do help to trap dust and other particles, they don’t offer any protection against more dangerous substances like mold spores or bacteria. 

2. Pleated Air Filters: Pleated air filters have many layers that trap more particles than traditional fiberglass filters, making them a good choice for those looking for higher levels of filtration. They can also last up to three months before needing to be replaced, meaning you don’t need to buy new ones as often as with other types of filters. 

3. High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) Filters: HEPA filters are capable of trapping even the smallest particles in the air – including pollen, smoke, pet dander and other allergens – giving you relief if you suffer from allergies or asthma. However, due to their high efficiency rating these air filter can be quite expensive compared to other types on the market so it may not be suitable for everyone’s budget. 

4 .Activated Carbon Air Filters: Activated carbon is great at absorbing odors and gases like cigarette smoke or cooking fumes from your home’s air supply but it won’t filter out larger particles like dust or pollen like some other types will do so it isn’t ideal if you suffer from allergies or asthma problems caused by airborne pollutants.. 

No matter what type of air filter you choose make sure that it fits correctly into your HVAC system as this will ensure optimal performance and filtration!
