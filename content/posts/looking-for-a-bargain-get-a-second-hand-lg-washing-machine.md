When it comes to washing machines, LG are known for their quality and great performance. Buying secondhand can represent an incredible value and you can often get a great quality machine for far less than buying new. Additionally, secondhand machines may come with a warranty, giving you added peace of mind. Don't be afraid to ask about the seller's return policy before committing to a purchase. 

When shopping for a secondhand LG washing machine, it's important to inspect it thoroughly before making a purchase. Make sure all buttons, settings, and functions are present, and that any lights or indicators are in working order. Additionally, check for rust, grime, and other signs of wear. If the machine looks physically damaged in any way, you may want to pass on it. 

It's also a good idea to test the washing machine before buying it. This could involve some trial and error, but it's the best way to determine whether the machine is in good working order. Try putting a few items of washing in and turning it on. If your clothes come out clean, then you have a winner! 

Buying a secondhand LG washing machine is a great way to save on costs and still enjoy the same features and performance that you would expect from a new one. Before making a purchase, be sure to inspect the appliance and test it out first to ensure that it is in good working order.
