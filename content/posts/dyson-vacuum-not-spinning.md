If you’ve recently purchased a Dyson vacuum cleaner and it’s not spinning, there could be a few different reasons why. In this blog, we’ll explain what could be causing the issue and how to fix it. 

The first thing you should check is the power cord. Make sure the cord is securely plugged into the outlet and the vacuum cleaner. If the cord is loose, it could be causing the vacuum not to spin. 

Next, check the filter. If the filter is clogged or dirty, it can prevent the vacuum from spinning. To clean the filter, remove it from the vacuum and rinse it with warm water. Let it air dry before reinserting it into the vacuum. 

If the filter is clean and the cord is securely plugged in, the issue could be with the brush bar. The brush bar is responsible for spinning the vacuum’s brush head. If it is clogged with debris or damaged, it can prevent the brush head from spinning. To clean the brush bar, remove it from the vacuum and use a brush to remove any debris. If the brush bar is damaged, you may need to replace it. 

Finally, check the belt. The belt is responsible for connecting the motor to the brush bar and if it is worn or damaged, it can prevent the brush head from spinning. To replace the belt, you will need to remove the brush bar and replace the belt with a new one. 

If you’ve checked all of these components and the vacuum still isn’t spinning, it’s possible that the motor is damaged and needs to be replaced. If this is the case, you will need to take the vacuum to a repair shop. 

We hope this blog has helped you understand why your Dyson vacuum isn’t spinning and how to fix it. If you’re still having trouble, contact a local repair shop for assistance.
