## Troubleshoot Fisher & Paykel Washing Machines in 5 Easy Steps

Having a well-functioning washing machine is essential for most households as it is used on a regular basis to keep our clothing and bedding clean and free from dirt and bacteria. Unfortunately, washing machines can sometimes develop faults and become unreliable. The good news is that some of these faults can be fixed by troubleshooting the machine yourself using a few simple steps. 

The first step is to identify the fault. If the washing machine won't turn on, the problem might be with the power supply or drainage pump. If the machine doesn't fill up with water, check to make sure that the water supply is on and try cleaning any filters. Detergent can also cause problems so make sure to use the correct amount and type of detergent for the load that is being washed. 

If you find that your Fisher & Paykel washing machine has no agitation, the cause might be that the lid isn't completely shut, or a jammed belt or pulley. To fix this, first make sure the lid is completely shut and then check to see if the belt or pulley is blocked or disengaged. If the machine is leaking, it may be due to a broken hose, worn valve seal ring or blocked filter. It is important to replace any worn parts promptly to prevent further damage. 

The fourth step is to check if the machine is overloaded. Fisher & Paykel washing machines must not be overloaded, as it can cause agitation problems and damage to the machine. Always make sure the load is appropriate for the size of the machine. Finally, check to make sure that the temperature settings are correct. If they are too low, the clothes may not be sufficiently washed, while too high of a setting can potentially damage the clothes. 

These five steps can help you to troubleshoot most commonly encountered faults on a Fisher & Paykel washing machine.
