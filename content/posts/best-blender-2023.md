Are you looking for the best front loader washing machine? If so, you have come to the right place. Front-loading washing machines are designed to provide a more efficient and thorough cleaning of your clothes than their top-loading counterparts. They use less water and energy, resulting in lower utility bills. Plus, they often feature bigger capacities and more advanced features than top-loaders. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the features to look for when selecting a front-loader, as well as our picks for the best front loader washing machines on the market today.

When it comes to choosing a front loading washer, there are several factors you should consider:

Capacity: How much laundry do you need to wash at one time? Front loaders typically range from 1 cubic foot (8 pounds of laundry) up to 5 cubic feet (40 pounds). The larger your family or household is, the larger capacity machine you’ll want to purchase. 

Energy Efficiency: Look for an Energy Star certified model which will use less energy and save you money on your monthly utility bills. 
Technology: Many modern front load washers feature advanced settings such as steam cycles and sanitize options that help ensure your clothes come out cleaner and fresher smelling than ever before. Some models also have Wi-Fi connectivity so that you can control them remotely from your smartphone or tablet device. 

Price: Budget is always an important consideration when it comes to making a purchase like this; however be sure not to sacrifice quality over price when selecting your washer as higher end units can provide better performance and additional features that can make life easier in the long run. 

 With these factors in mind, here are our picks for the best front loader washing machines on the market today:

	• LG Electronics WM3600HVA – This 4 cubic foot ultra large capacity washer has 12 different wash cycles including Steam Sanitary cycle which eliminates 99% of bacteria while being gentle on fabrics with its ColdWash technology which uses cold water temperatures combined with enhanced washing motions for maximum performance without sacrificing energy efficiency or gentleness on fabrics like other traditional top loaders do 

	• Samsung WF45K6500AV – This 4.2 cubic foot large capacity washer features advanced vibration reduction technology plus innovative addwash door so users can quickly throw in last minute items mid cycle without having to restart it again from scratch 

	• Maytag MHW5630HC – This 5 cubic foot extra large capacity washer has PowerWash cycle which uses extra cleaning action plus heated water temperatures to tackle even tough stains quicker than ever before while still being gentle enough on fabrics 

	• Electrolux EFLS627UTT – This 4 cu ft ultra large capacity washer has IQ Touch Controls with perfect steam option plus LuxCare Wash System which combines powerful stain removal capabilities using cold water temperatures plus enhanced cleaning motions all while saving up energy costs along way
