Whether it's a new commercial-grade product on the market or a breakthrough in consumer pricing and features, knowing the latest news is key to finding the best appliance for your home.

Currently, the blender market is experiencing a boost due to more commercial-grade models being released. Professional-grade blenders are becoming more affordable and accessible to home cooks.

Finally, a key trend in the blender space is the increasing availability of alternatives to traditional glass or stainless steel blending jars. More and more manufacturers are introducing innovative containers manufactured from materials such as BPA-free plastics and silicone. These alternative containers come with many advantages, such as improved durability and convenience with respect to cleanup.

Overall, developments in blenders show no sign of slowing down as manufacturers strive to provide a greater variety of models with more features and convenience.
