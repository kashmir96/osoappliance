With summer quickly approaching, many of us are turning on our air conditioners to keep cool and comfortable during the hot months. Although air conditioning can be a great way to beat the heat, it also comes with certain risks and dangers that we should be aware of.

First, air conditioning systems require regular maintenance in order for them to operate at peak efficiency and safety. Poorly maintained systems can consume more energy than necessary, driving up your electric bills and potentially leading to fire hazards or other problems. It's important that all parts of an AC system are regularly checked and cleaned by a qualified technician in order to ensure optimal performance and safety. 

Second, air conditioning units can accumulate mold over time if not properly maintained. Mold spores can travel through the system’s cooling coils, ducts and filters before ultimately being released into your home’s air supply where they can cause allergic reactions or respiratory ailments in some people. To prevent mold growth, ensure that all parts of your AC unit are regularly cleaned to reduce the chances of excess moisture buildup which would allow mold spores to fester within the system. 

Finally, improperly installed or malfunctioning AC units have been known to leak refrigerant into the environment which is harmful both for people as well as animals living nearby who could be exposed directly or indirectly through groundwater contamination from leaked refrigerant lines near bodies of water. Therefore it is important that any new installations are performed correctly by certified technicians using approved materials suited for their specific applications in order to minimize any potential environmental harm caused by leaking refrigerants. 

Overall, it's clear that there are various dangers associated with using an air conditioner if proper maintenance is not adhered too. By taking all necessary precautions when dealing with your AC unit such as scheduling regular maintenance checks from a qualified technician or ensuring proper installation when installing a new unit you can help minimize these risks while still enjoying cool comfort throughout summer months!
