As summer approaches, it’s important to be aware of how to use your air conditioning (AC) system as an air purifier. With the right settings and maintenance, your AC can help you breathe easier in your home and improve the overall air quality. 

The first step to using your AC as an air purifier is setting the temperature correctly. You want to keep the temperature just cool enough that you feel comfortable in the house, but not so cold that you’re running up your electric bill unnecessarily. Generally speaking, it’s best to keep temperatures between 75-78 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Next, make sure that you replace or clean your AC filters regularly according to manufacturer instructions. This will help ensure that pollutants like dust and pollen are filtered out from the air inside of your home before being circulated back into the living space. It’s also important to note that some filters may need changing more often than others; for example, if someone in your household has allergies or asthma then a higher quality filter may need replacing more frequently than a standard one. 

When using your AC as an air purifier, it’s also important to regularly clean other parts of the system such as coils and condensate pans which can collect dirt and debris over time. This will help ensure optimal performance from your unit which can further improve indoor air quality by removing additional airborne contaminants like mold spores, bacteria, viruses etc.. Additionally, make sure any ductwork is sealed properly so there isn't any leakage which could bring contaminants into your home from outside sources - this is especially critical if you live in an area with higher levels of outdoor pollution such as industrial sites or near traffic-heavy roads/highways etc.. 

Finally - make sure you get regular professional maintenance performed on both inside and outside components of the system by a qualified HVAC technician every 2-3 months depending on usage and local environmental conditions (for instance areas with higher levels of pollen/dust during certain times of year). This will help keep everything running smoothly while also ensuring optimal indoor air quality throughout year round - something everyone should strive for!
