## Make Extra Money with Scrap Value Bottle Caps 
Are you trying to find new ways to get a little extra money? Recycling bottle caps is a great start! By collecting bottle caps from water, soda, and even beer bottles and selling them for scrap value, you can gain some extra cash in your coin purse. 

When it comes to selling bottle caps for scrap, you’ll want to try to include as many different types of caps as possible. Different types of bottle caps vary in value, so you’ll want to try to include a variety of them. It’s also important to ensure that your bottle caps are all in relatively good condition, without any major dents or discolouration before you take them to be recycled. 

If you’re looking for the most efficient way to collect a variety of bottle caps, the easiest method is by asking friends, family members, or people in your community for their used bottle caps. You can even set up a few donation boxes around your city or neighbourhood for people to drop their bottled caps off. It’s also possible to purchase bottle caps online, although you’ll likely want to make sure you’re only buying rare or hard to find caps that can be recycled for higher returns. 

When you’ve collected a variety of bottle caps, you can then take them to a scrap recycling center to be sorted and weighed. Different sizes and types of caps have different rates of value, so they will be marked and weighed accordingly. After your caps have been weighed and recorded, you’ll be paid right away in cash! 

Recycling bottle caps for scrap value is a great way to add some money to your coin purse without much effort needed. Before you start collecting, make sure to research what types of caps have the highest returns and keep them intact by avoiding dents and damage. With just a few steps, collecting and recycling bottle caps can become a regular source of revenue.
