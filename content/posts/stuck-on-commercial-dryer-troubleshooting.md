## How To Tackle Commercial Dryer Troubleshooting

Are you having trouble figuring out why your commercial dryer is not working? It can be frustrating when your dryer isn’t drying clothes or is otherwise malfunctioning. Thankfully, you can use commercial dryer troubleshooting to identify the problem and get your dryer back in working order.

The first step to dryer troubleshooting is to identify the issue. If the dryer isn’t running at all, the first thing to do is check the power outlet and test the power with a circuit tester. If power is present, then you should check the dryer’s circuit breaker. If it seems ok, you can next check the dryer’s door switch. If all these tests come back negative, you may need to move on to the dryer’s motor and other components.

Another common issue is when the dryer’s drum isn’t rotating. First check to make sure there is no lint blocking fhe lint filter. Then also check for any obstructions in the drum. If all these are clear, you should inspect the motor and motor belt to make sure they are functioning correctly.

If you have a dryer that is overheating, first check the vent and make sure it’s not clogged. Also make sure the thermostat and thermal limiter are clean and working properly. If everything looks to be in order, then it’s a good idea to clean the interior of the dryer with a vacuum and dust remover to remove built-up dust, dirt and lint.

There can be several other problems that require commercial dryer troubleshooting. In most cases, however, you can diagnose and repair the problem on your own with a little time and effort. If you are having difficulty troubleshooting, you can also consider contacting a certified appliance repair technician who can give you quick and efficient service.
