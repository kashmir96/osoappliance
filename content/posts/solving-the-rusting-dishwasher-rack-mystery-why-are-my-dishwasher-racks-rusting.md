## Determining the Cause of Rusting Dishwasher Racks
It can be a surprise and a nuisance when dishwasher racks start to rust. While it is a fairly common problem, the cause of this rust can often be difficult to determine. If you find yourself asking “Why are my dishwasher racks rusting?”, read this blog to help you understand the possible causes. 

One of the most common causes of rusting on dishwasher racks is simply due to the materials used in the manufacture of the racks. Many dishwashers use plastic coated wire racks, and over time the combination of water, heat and the chemicals used in the dishwasher detergent can cause the coating to degrade. The rust is a combination of metal and oxidation, resulting in the familiar reddish-brown color. 

Another potential cause of dishwasher rack rust is a crack or tear in the plastic coating. This can be caused by general wear and tear over time, or from an item placed in the rack that is too large or heavy. If there is a crack or tear, it allows moisture and oxygen to access the metal beneath the coating, leading to rust formation. 

Incorrect dishwasher detergent may also be to blame when it comes to dishwasher rack rust. Certain detergents and additives, or even hard water build up, can cause the plastic coating to be more easily degraded. The result is a loss of protective barrier between the metal and the elements, leading to rust. 

Not cleaning your dishwasher racks regularly can also lead to rust. Over time, food debris and other residue can build up on the surfaces of the racks, leading to corrosion. To prevent this, you should clean the racks regularly by hand or utilize the dishwasher's self-cleaning or sanitizing cycle. 

Finally, if you have had the same dishwasher for a number of years, the age of the appliance itself can contribute to rust. If the seals are damaged or the connection to the water source is faulty, water may be able to enter the dishwasher and cause water damage and corrosion. 

It is important to determine the cause of rusting dishwasher racks in order to rectify the problem and prevent it from happening again in the future. It’s a good idea to inspect the racks for damage, use the appropriate detergent, and take the time to clean your appliance regularly.
