Robots are increasingly becoming a part of our everyday lives. From vacuum cleaners to factory assembly lines, robots have made their way into numerous aspects of our lives. But what exactly is a robot? A robot is an artificial intelligence that performs tasks autonomously or with guidance from humans. They are often programmed to complete specific tasks, like cleaning floors or assembling components in factories. 

The most common robots are industrial robots, which are used in factories and warehouses for various production operations. Industrial robots can be programmed to perform multiple tasks, such as welding, cutting, painting, and loading and unloading materials from machines or conveyor belts. They can also be used for repetitive operations like packing boxes or sorting fruits and vegetables.

Another type of robot that is gaining popularity is the service robot. Service robots are designed to interact with people in order to provide assistance in daily activities such as cooking meals or providing companionship to seniors who live alone. These types of robots are being developed specifically for use in homes and hospitals as they provide a safe alternative when it comes to helping the elderly with their daily routines. 

Robotic arms are also becoming increasingly common across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, aerospace engineering and construction sites where they can be used for carrying out complex operations with precision and accuracy that would otherwise not be achievable by human hands alone. Robotic arms come equipped with sensors that allow them to detect changes in the environment around them so they can adjust their movements accordingly to complete tasks accurately without endangering anyone nearby. 

Finally thereâ€™s the growing use of drones which can be used for surveillance purposes or even delivering goods from one location to another quickly and efficiently without any human intervention required at all times during the process. Drones have become particularly popular amongst consumers who want quick delivery services without having any physical contact with an individual delivering it directly at their doorstep making it easier than ever before for customers all over the world receive goods right at their doorsteps within minutes!
