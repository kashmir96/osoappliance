## Can You Get Diseases from Laundromats? Understanding the Risks of Laundry Services 

If you’re a frequent laundromat user, you may be wondering if there are risks of diseases associated with using public laundry services. Unfortunately, while it’s not likely that you’ll catch a serious illness from using a laundromat, there are some potential health hazards to be aware of. In this article, we will explain the potential risks associated with using public laundry services and provide tips for staying safe when doing your laundry. 

One risk associated with public laundry services is exposure to germs and bacteria. While most people take steps to clean their clothes properly before putting them in the wash at home, it can be difficult to know what kind of germs an item has been exposed to at a public laundromat. Furthermore, many people do not use detergents or other cleaning products when doing their laundry at these facilities. This can lead to cross-contamination between clothing items and increase exposure to germs and bacteria that could cause illnesses such as colds or flu-like symptoms. 

Another potential risk is exposure to chemicals used in the washing machines or dryers. It is important for laundromats to regularly maintain their equipment and ensure that they are properly cleaned between uses in order to reduce exposure levels of potentially harmful chemical residues left behind by previous customers. If a machine has not been properly maintained or cleaned recently, then it may still contain residues from previous uses which could pose health risks if inhaled or absorbed through contact with skin or eyes while doing your own laundry load. 

Finally, another risk associated with using public facilities is theft—both of personal belongings as well as money spent on coins for machines which may malfunction due to faulty wiring or outdated technology used by the facility itself. To protect against theft while doing your laundry at a public facility it is important take precautions such as removing all valuables from pockets before loading clothing into machines; avoiding leaving coins unattended; notifying staff immediately if any machinery appears faulty; and always paying attention while on premises so that any suspicious activity can be reported quickly before items are stolen away unseen! 

Overall, while there are certainly potential risks associated with using laundromats it's important remember that these incidents are rare and can easily be avoided by taking extra care when handling clothing items both before during after use at any facility - whether private residential home ones commercial establishments alike! For those who don't want worry about these risks altogether consider appliance rentals instead - renting appliances like washers & dryers makes sense cost-wise too since renters only pay for what they need without having commit long-term contracts [here](./pages/appliance-rental).
