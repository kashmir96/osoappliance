Stove sizes vary depending on the type of stove you are looking for, but the most popular size is a 30-inch freestanding range. This size range is perfect for home cooks because it has ample space for cookware and can be easily installed in most existing kitchen layouts without having to make any major modifications. A 30-inch stove typically has four burners, a moderately sized oven, and a broiler drawer. 

If you are looking for something larger than a 30-inch stove, you might want to consider a 36-inch stove. This size offers more cooking space with five burners plus an extra large oven and broiler drawer. It’s perfect for those who need more room to prepare larger meals or entertain frequently. 

For those with limited kitchen space, there are 24-inch stoves available that offer two burners and a smaller oven capacity but still provide enough room to whip up some delicious meals. If you don’t need all the bells and whistles of a full-size range but still want basic cooking capabilities, this might be the right choice for your kitchen needs. 

Finally, if you have an especially small kitchen or just don’t need anything beyond basic cooking abilities, consider picking up a 20-inch range that typically only comes with one burner plus an oven compartment. This is great if all you need is something simple that takes up minimal counter space and won’t break your budget either! 

No matter what size range fits your needs best, there are plenty of options out there when it comes to finding the right fit for your kitchen layout!
