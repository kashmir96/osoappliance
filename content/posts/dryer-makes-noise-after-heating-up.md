If you've noticed your dryer making more noise than usual after heating up, it can be a sign of a problem that requires professional help. But before you call a repair service, there are several things you can do yourself to try and fix the issue.

First, check that the exhaust vent is clear of lint and debris. This could be blocking airflow and causing noise as the motor works harder to push air through. If it’s clogged, clean it out using a vacuum cleaner or brush attachment.

Next, check for any loose parts or screws inside the dryer cabinet. Over time, these components can become worn out or come loose due to vibrations created by the machine’s operation. Make sure everything is securely fastened before continuing with other troubleshooting steps. 

If your machine has rollers or drum glides at the back of its cylinder tube (which helps keep clothes from bunching up), make sure they're not worn down too far or missing entirely — if so, replace them with new parts so they can continue providing adequate support to prevent further damage to internal components during operation. 

Dryer belts should also be checked for signs of wear; if they are frayed or cracked, replace them with new ones as soon as possible for smoother operation and less noise when running your appliance. Additionally, ensure all other moving parts such as pulleys and wheels are properly lubricated using manufacturer-approved lubricants in order to reduce friction-related noises when spinning clothes inside your dryer drum. 

Finally, if all else fails - please contact an experienced repair technician who will have access to specialized tools and knowledge on how best to diagnose & fix whatever issue may be causing excessive noise coming from your appliance's motor area!
