# How to maintain a dishwasher

It’s easy to forget about our dishwashers; once we’ve loaded it up and turn it on, we don’t pay it much attention until the dishes come out clean. But in order to keep your dishwasher running at peak efficiency, there are a few maintenance habits you should get into.

First and foremost, you should make sure to clean your dishwasher regularly. This means running a cleaning cycle with either vinegar or a dedicated product like Affresh, which can help dissolve any built-up residue from detergent or food scraps that might be caught in the filter. Doing this about once per month can help prevent mold and mildew from accumulating and causing unpleasant odors.

If you have hard water, you may need to “descale” your dishwasher every couple of months as well. This involves adding a solution of citric acid or vinegar to the bottom of the dishwasher in order to break down mineral deposits that can cause buildup inside the machine over time. Just be sure to follow the instructions on whichever product you use so that you don’t accidentally damage any components of the machine while descaling it!

Finally, there are some simple things that can help maintain your dishwasher's performance between deep cleanings. Make sure not to overload it with dishes (which might prevent them from getting properly cleaned), and scrape off any large chunks of food before loading them in for washing so that they don’t end up clogging up filters or jets down below. Additionally, if possible try not to run too many consecutive cycles without allowing for some air circulation between each one—this will help keep moisture levels down inside, which is essential for preventing mold growth!  Following these simple tips will ensure that your dishwasher continues running efficiently for years down the line!
