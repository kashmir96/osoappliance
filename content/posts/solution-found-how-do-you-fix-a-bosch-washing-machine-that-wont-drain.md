## Repairing a Bosch Washing Machine That Won't Drain
If your Bosch Washing Machine isn’t draining correctly, it can be a frustrating and time consuming problem. Fortunately, with a few simple steps, you can quickly fix this issue and get your washing machine back in working order.

The first step to take is to check your drain hose and make sure it is clean and unobstructed. A clogged hose is a very common cause of a washing machine that won’t drain properly. Try unclogging the hose with a plunger, or using a mixture of water and vinegar to break down any blockages. Additionally, make sure the hose is correctly connected to the correct drainage pipe.

The next step you can take is to examine the drain filter and make sure it is clean. The filter can become clogged with lint, dirt, and other debris, which can cause blockages that prevent the washing machine from draining. Use a brush to remove any debris that has built up, and vacuum out the filter if necessary.

Finally, if neither of these steps work, check to see if your washing machine is level. A machine that is not level can prevent the pump from draining correctly, so use a level and adjust the feet of the machine until it is level and securely installed.

Taking these steps should get the washing machine back up and running. If these steps do not work, it might be time to call for professional help or try replacing the pump.

No one likes dealing with a washing machine that won’t drain, but fortunately you can usually fix this issue quickly and easily with a few simple steps. If none of these solutions work, it’s time to contact a professional to diagnose and repair the washing machine.
