Solo Stove is an outdoor cooking and camping equipment company that was founded in 2010 in Dallas, Texas. The company specializes in making wood burning stoves and accessories. The Solo Stove's original design was the result of a collaboration between two friends, engineers Jody Benson and Chris McAllister. 

The idea for the stove came from a need to find an efficient way to cook outdoors that didn’t require carrying around bulky fuel or propane tanks. The two founders put their engineering skills to work and developed the Solo Stove, which is a wood burning stove with an innovative design that uses convection to maximize heat output from the fire. The unique air intake vents on the bottom of the stove draw air up into an internal chamber where it is heated before being drawn out through top vents, creating a highly efficient burn. 

Since its founding, Solo Stove has grown into one of the most popular outdoor cooking brands on the market today. Their products are sold all over the world and have been featured in numerous magazines, websites, and TV shows such as National Geographic’s “Adventure Series” and “Man vs Wild” with Bear Grylls. 

Solo Stove continues to innovate their product line by offering new products such as their fire pits, backpacking stoves, grills and accessories; while still staying true to their mission of creating innovative outdoor cooking solutions that are both functional and sustainable.
