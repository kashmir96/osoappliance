# How to stop leaving stove on

When you're busy with life, it's easy to forget to turn off your stove. Unfortunately, leaving the stove on can cause serious safety hazards, such as fire and gas leaks. To help ensure your home is safe and secure, here are some tips on how to stop leaving the stove on:

1. Make sure all knobs are set to "off" each time you finish cooking—it takes just seconds but could save you from a big headache down the line! 
2. Place a note in an obvious spot near your kitchen that says “Remember to turn off the stove” so that it will act as a reminder when necessary 
3. Install motion sensors or alarm systems near your kitchen that alert you if something has been left cooking for too long 
4. Leave yourself audio reminders- set up automated recordings of yourself saying “Don't forget to turn off the stove” so they play when it’s time for dinner 
5. Get into the habit of always checking for open flames before leaving the house—just give each burner one quick glance before rushing out 
6. Ask someone else in your home or trusted neighbor/friend nearby who can double check if need be  

 Following these simple steps can go a long way towards keeping everyone safe when using your cooker! Remember—safety first!
