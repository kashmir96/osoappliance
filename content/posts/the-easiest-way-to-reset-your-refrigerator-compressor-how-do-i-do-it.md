## Resetting Your Refrigerator Compressor: A Step-by-Step Guide
You’ve been told that resetting your refrigerator compressor may help with cooling issues, but how do you do it? Refrigerator resetting can save you time and money on repairs by allowing you to diagnose and fix the problem yourself. In this post, we’ll provide a step-by-step guide to resetting your refrigerator compressor.

The first step is to unplug the refrigerator from the wall and close any open doors. Then you should locate and press the power reset switch. The switch should be somewhere on the back or side of the refrigerator, typically behind the bottom grille. Once you press the switch, hold it down for five seconds, and then let go. The compressor should then restart, and the cooling cycle should begin again.

If the reset switch didn't help, you may need to perform a hard reset. Instead of pressing the reset switch, turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to the refrigerator. This disconnects all power from the unit, which can help reset any electronics. Then turn the breaker back on, and all parts should restart as normal. This may also reset any faults that may have been present before.

If the reset doesn’t work, then it’s time to call a technician. When calling your appliance provider, be sure to reference error codes from our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to help diagnose the problem. This will help our technicians quickly understand the issue and know exactly what to do.

For any refrigerator-related problem, resetting the compressor is often a quick and easy initial fix. Our step-by-step guide can help you reset your refrigerator compressor with minimal effort and time on your end. If the problem persists, please be sure to reference our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary to help our technicians diagnose the problem.
