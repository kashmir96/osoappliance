## Keeping Your Home Electric - Understanding the Most Common Problems

From lights that won't switch off to unexpected power surges, having an understanding of the most common electrical problems around the house can help make your home safer and keep your appliances in good condition. Here is a list of the 10 most common electrical problems you should be on the lookout for. 

1. Faulty Light Switches: If the switch is stuck on, won’t turn off the light, or is warm to the touch, this could be a sign of an issue with the connections and should be investigated by a professional electrician. 

2. Damaged Appliance Cords: Frayed, cracked, or split appliance cords could be a fire hazard. Inspect cords regularly and make sure they are not stretched out or pulled tight, as this can wear down the internal connection and create a safety risk.

3. Circuit Overloads: If your circuit breaker keeps tripping or you have too many appliances running on the same circuit, you may be pushing your circuit’s power output beyond the rated amperage. To fix, you can move some appliances to another circuit.

4. Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) Issues: GFCIs are outlets that protect people from electric shock by cutting off power when a short in the circuit is detected. If your GFCI is consistently tripping, it may not be able to handle the amount of electricity passing through it.

5. Loose Outlets: If an outlet feels loose, it could mean a broken off prong or a loose connection, both of which can create a fire hazard.

6. Poor Insulation: If your wiring is not properly insulated, moisture can occur and the wiring can be exposed.

7. Outdated Electrical System: Electrical systems become outdated over time, so if you live in an older home, it’s important to have your wiring checked regularly to make sure it’s up to code.

8. Flickering Lights: This is often a sign of a faulty connection or worn out switch and may be a fire hazard.

9. Overheating: If wires, switches, or outlets are hot to the touch, it could be a sign of improper wiring or poor ventilation.

10. Power Surges: These occur when spikes of electricity flow into your home and can damage sensitive electronic equipment. 

By understanding the most common electrical problems in the home, you can stay safe and extend the life of your appliances. If you experience any of these issues in your home, it’s best to call an experienced professional electrician for help. Ready to upgrade your appliances?
