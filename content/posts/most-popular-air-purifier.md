Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular as more people become concerned about the air quality in their homes. Many factors, ranging from dust and pollen to pet dander and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can cause indoor air pollution. An air purifier can help reduce these pollutants, leaving you with cleaner, healthier air.

There are a variety of different types of air purifiers on the market today, but the most popular models tend to be those that use mechanical filtration. These models use advanced filters to capture and remove particles from the air before they enter your home or office space. The best filters for this type of model are HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which are designed to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns in size — that’s smaller than the diameter of a human hair! Some models also feature an activated carbon filter for removing odors and VOCs from the air.

Other popular types of air purifiers include ionizers and ultraviolet (UV) light systems. Ionizers release negative ions into the atmosphere which attach to airborne particles and cause them to drop out of circulation; UV light systems use UV lamps to destroy bacteria and viruses in your home or office space before they can spread through your breathing zone (the area where you spend most of your time).

No matter which type of model you choose, it’s important to pay attention to its CADR rating — this indicates how well it cleans by measuring how much a particular volume of air is cleaned each minute on high speed settings. A higher CADR rating indicates better performance overall, so make sure you look for one with a rating that meets your needs!
