# Washing machine wobbles

A washer that wobbles can be a very frustrating problem. It can cause excessive noise and damage to both the machine and your laundry room. The good news is, a wobbly washing machine is usually an easy problem to fix.

First, check for objects underneath the washing machine that could be causing it to wobble. Things like coins or other small items can get lodged in the feet of the machine and create an uneven base, causing it to move around when in use. Remove any foreign objects from under the machine before proceeding with further inspection.

Another possible cause for a wobbly washer could be uneven flooring or an unsupported dryer above it. Make sure your floor is level, as well as an adequate amount of space between yourself, your dryer and/or other appliances nearby that might interfere with your washing machines operation .
 
If after checking these factors your washer continues to wobble then you may need to adjust its feet accordingly. On most modern machines there should be 4 adjustable feet at the bottom of each corner, which you can turn clockwise or counter-clockwise in order to level out the appliance and stabilize it on the floor surface. 

Finally inspect all four of your washing machines hoses for any signs of wear or leaks which could have been caused by excess movement of apparatus over time due such as our previous causes mentioned above. If you find them loose fasten them back up securely with hose clamps and ensure they’re placed correctly according to their manufacturer’s instructions otherwise this may lead to more vibration problems down the line so make sure each connection is properly tightened before using again . 

If you are still unable to resolve this issue then contact a professional repairman who will do so efficiently without any hassle!
