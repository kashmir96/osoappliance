If you’ve recently replaced some of your household appliances, you may be wondering how to properly dispose of them. Disposing of large appliances can be tricky, as they aren’t easy to transport and many communities don’t accept them at their local waste management facilities. Fortunately, there are several different options available for the proper disposal of your old appliance. 

One option is to see if the store where you purchased your new appliance offers a recycling program. Many stores will take back old appliances and either recycle or donate them to charities or local organizations in need. Additionally, many cities and towns provide curbside pickup services that will pick up bulky items such as large appliances from your home for free or a small fee. 

If neither of those options are available to you, you can also look into renting a dumpster and having someone haul away the unwanted appliance for you. This may be more costly than other methods but is an effective way to get rid of large items such as refrigerators, stoves, and washers and dryers without having to worry about transporting them yourself. 

Finally, if all else fails there are companies that specialize in appliance removal services who will come directly to your house and take away any unwanted appliances for a fee. Before hiring one of these companies though it’s important to do some research online first in order to compare prices between different services in order to find the best deal possible. 

No matter what method you choose for disposing of old household appliances it is important that all hazardous materials such as batteries or Freon (from refrigerators) are removed before doing so in order to ensure proper disposal practices are followed and the environment is protected from any potential harm caused by these materials being released into the atmosphere during disposal process.
