## 5 Common Microwave Problems and How to Fix Them

Microwaves are an essential household appliance that we use multiple times a day. We can quickly and easily heat food, defrost items, or even cook an entire meal without having to turn on the oven. Because it is used regularly, problems may arise over time. Knowing the common problems to look out for and how to spot and fix them will help keep your microwave running smoothly day in and day out. 

One of the most common issues with a microwave is poor performance due to lacking the proper wattage. Generally, microwaves have wattages ranging from 800 to 1,500, and the microwave will likely have this information on the back or underside of the door. If the wattage in your microwave is lower than desired, consider investing in a new microwave with the proper wattage.

The second issue is probably the most common one, a blown fuse due to a short circuit. When your microwave does not seem to be working properly, first try resetting the fuse by unplugging the unit from the wall and then plugging it back in. If this does not solve the issue, you may need to replace the fuse in the microwave. This can be a tricky process and should be done with the help of a qualified technician. 

The third issue that may arise is a microwave running for too long, which happens if a timer does not work correctly or if the power settings are too high. To solve this, simply check the timer setting and adjust as necessary to ensure that the appliance is not running for too long. If this does not solve the problem and the microwave is running too long, you may need to have the power settings adjusted by a technician.

The fourth problem may be a malfunctioning door latch. This common issue can often be fixed easily without needing the help of a technician. First, check the latch mechanism and make sure that it is clean and properly lubricated. If that does not work, try replacing the latch mechanism.

Finally, the fifth most common problem is a dead microwave. This happens if the microwave’s internal components stop working for some reason. If it is electrical, it may need to be serviced by a qualified technician. If the issue has to do with worn out parts, the component may need to be replaced.

## Conclusion

There you have it. The five most common problems with microwaves and how to fix them. The key takeaway is that prevention is better than cure and it is important to regularly maintain and check the wattage, fuse and other components of a microwave. If problems arise, remember that a qualified technician can help you in fixing an issue with your microwave.

## 5 Common Microwave Problems
#### What are the most common microwave problems? 
The most common microwave problems are:
- Sparks inside the machine 
- Poor heating performance
- Display panel not working
- Unusual noises from the microwave 
- Motor not spinning

#### How do I know if my microwave is sparking inside? 
If you see an orange or blue spark coming from the inside of the microwave when cooking, it’s a sure sign that there is an issue with either the interior light or the magnetron (a high voltage transformer in the microwave that creates the heat).

#### What should I do if my microwave isn't heating food properly? 
Ensure that the internal temperature sensor is not blocked by food. If the temperature sensor is blocked, it will not be able to monitor the correct internal temperature and the microwave will fail to heat the food evenly. You can also check to see if the door or seal is damaged or loose, as this can also cause poor heating.

#### What if the microwave display panel has stopped working? 
If the display panel has stopped working, the most likely cause is a blown fuse or a faulty control board. If the display panel is not working, you cannot use the microwave until the cause of the problem is identified and fixed.

#### What should I do if I hear unusual noises coming from the microwave? 
Unusual noises coming from your microwave could be the sign of a worn out roller support or a damaged drum belt. If you hear grinding or thumping noises while the microwave is running, you should stop it immediately and contact a qualified service technician to check and fix the problem.

#### What if the motor is not spinning?
If the motor is not spinning, it is likely to be caused by a faulty capacitor or a worn out motor. A qualified service technician should be able to inspect and diagnose the cause of the problem so it can be fixed.
