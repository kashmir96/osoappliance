## Learn How to Easily Fix a Microwave with These Tips

Microwaves are one of the most useful and oft-used pieces of equipment in your kitchen. Unfortunately, due to wear and tear, it's not uncommon for them to break down or experience issues from time to time. Luckily, with the help of some simple tips, you can figure out how to fix your microwave instantly without having to call an appliance repair technician.

If that doesn’t help, it could be related to a defective circuit board or other issue. In this case, it is best to call in a professional.

If your microwave isn’t turning on it may be a result of a faulty power cord or loose connection. First, check the outlet, as well as the connection of the power cord at both ends. If everything seems good there, it is likely that something inside the microwave is broken and again, it may be best to opt for a repair technician.

A humming sound from the microwave may signify that it is running without actually heating up. This could be an issue with the door switch, high voltage diode, or a magnetron.
