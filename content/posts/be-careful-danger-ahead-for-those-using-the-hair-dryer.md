## Hairdryers Carry Fire Risk When Used Improperly

Hairdryers are great beauty and time-saving appliances that can have many benefits, but when used improperly, they can lead to dangerous situations quickly. It's important to take some time to make sure the hairdryer you are using is safe and not a safety hazard.

Hairdryers draw a lot of power, so if it overheats it can cause a potential fire. This can happen if the hairdryer is old or damaged, if blocked vents are restricting airflow, or if the user keeps the hairdryer too close to combustible materials. It's also important to trust the hairdryer. If it smells burning, look for fraying wires, or sparks, then it is an electrical hazard, is unsafe to use, and needs to be replaced or checked out by an appliance repair technician. 

Hairdryers also use a lot of electricity, so even when they aren't a physical hazard, they can cause drastic increases in electricity bills. Periodically unplugging the hairdryer when not in use can help reduce the energy usage, and it also makes sure that it doesn't cause harm if it gets knocked over.

When using a hairdryer, be aware of the potential fire risk and make sure to follow the instructions and keep the appliance away from combustible materials to reduce the risk and keep yourself and your loved ones safe. Make sure to get any malfunctioning hairdryers checked out by a certified appliance repair technician. If you're looking for the experienced technician near you, be sure to check out our [directory of appliance repair technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). 

Hairdryers can be a great tool, but they must be used with caution and proper care to ensure safety and avoid dangerous hazards. Be sure to familiarize yourself with your hairdryer, recognize any signs of physical damage, and unplug it when not in use. With the proper care, hairdryers can be a great tool for looking your best without the danger of a potential fire.
