An electric gas cooker is a kitchen appliance that uses an electrical current to heat the cooking surface and cook food. It works in much the same way as a traditional stovetop, only the heat is generated from electricity instead of gas. Electric gas cookers are becoming increasingly popular due to their convenience, safety and efficiency.

Electric gas cookers are typically smaller than traditional stoves and have less space for large pots and pans. This can make them more suitable for small kitchens or apartments where counter space is limited. They also require less ventilation than traditional stoves, since they do not produce any smoke or fumes when heating up. This makes them ideal for people who live in homes without proper ventilation systems or those who suffer from respiratory issues such as asthma.

Electric gas cookers use electricity to generate heat which is then transferred to the cooking surface via a coil or ceramic plate on top of the stove. The surface will usually include multiple burners which allow you to control both temperature and intensity of each burner independently from one another. Some electric gas cookers even come with additional features such as timers, warming elements, defrosters and even griddles or grills for added versatility when preparing meals at home.

Overall, electric gas cookers offer an efficient and convenient way to prepare meals at home without having to worry about fumes or smoke-related health risks associated with traditional stoves. They can be easily installed in tight spaces due to their compact size, making them perfect for small kitchens or apartments with minimal counter space available. Plus, their ability to adjust temperatures quickly means that you can easily switch between different dishes while still maintaining consistent results every time!
