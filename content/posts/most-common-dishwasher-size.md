When it comes to purchasing a dishwasher, size is an important factor to consider. Generally speaking, there are three common sizes of dishwashers available—standard, slimline, and compact. 

Standard-size dishwashers measure 24 inches wide and typically have enough room for 12 place settings. Some models may even fit up to 16 place settings. These dishwashers are designed to be installed under a kitchen countertop or in an adjacent cabinet and can easily accommodate large pots and pans. 

Slimline dishwashers are narrower than the standard size—measuring 18 inches wide—but just as deep as regular-sized models. As such, they can hold fewer dishes than their larger counterparts but still offer plenty of space for everyday needs such as plates and glasses. These narrow units also tend to be more energy efficient than standard-sized models due to their reduced capacity. 

Compact (or mini) dishwashers are even narrower at 17 inches wide with a shallow depth of just 15 inches deep—making them ideal for tight spaces like apartments or RVs where larger appliances may not fit comfortably into the layout of the room or kitchen area. While these smaller versions won’t hold as many dishes as standard or slimline models, they can still accommodate up to eight place settings with ease and provide enough space for daily washing needs without taking up too much real estate in smaller kitchens .
