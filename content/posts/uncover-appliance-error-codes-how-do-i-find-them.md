## Decoding Error Codes from Your Home Appliances
For many homeowners and renters, having an appliance stop working correctly can be a worrying experience. Trying to figure out how to get it working again can be even more daunting. To help make it easier to diagnose the issue and get our appliances running again, some appliances now come packaged with error codes that point us in the right direction towards resolution. Let's look at how we can locate and interpret these codes. 

The error codes that your appliance displays usually show up as a letter or series of letters and numbers. Depending on the manufacturer of your appliance, some are fairly easy to interpret while others may require a little bit more detective work. 

For easy to interpret codes, an instruction manual or quick reference guide will likely provide an explanation for the code. Check for these codes first and it's important to take note that not all codes are error codes, some are simply part of the standard operating procedure of the machine.

If no documentation is available, head to the manufacturer's website. Most manufacturers, including the industry leaders, have all of the manuals and error code descriptions available for download. If the code isn't already in easy to decode numbers and letters, it may be in the form of an acronym.

In some cases, the manual might still not provide an explanation for the code. If this happens, a good source of information is online customer support forums where owners of the same appliance come together to share troubleshooting techniques. Here you'll be able to search for your specific error code, narrowing your search down to the exact model and model type.

Follow these steps and you should be able to uncover appliance error codes quickly and get your appliance up and running again quickly. Need help finding the right appliance for your home? Make sure to check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to get started.
