When it comes to drinking water, there are many options on the market and filtered water is one of them. Filtered water has been around for a while but recently has become more popular due to its convenience and perceived health benefits. While filtered water can seem like a great choice, it may not always be the best option for your health and safety. Here are some of the dangers of drinking filtered water. 

1. Contamination – Filters don’t always remove all contaminants from the water, so there is still a risk that you could be drinking contaminated water if you opt for this option. Unfiltered water contains things like bacteria, parasites, and viruses that can cause illness if consumed. Even with filtration, some contaminants may remain in your drinking water depending on how powerful the filter is and how often it’s changed or replaced. 

2. Lead Leaching – Filters can leach lead into your drinking water even if they are designed to remove it from tap or well-water sources. The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) tested several types of filters from different brands and found that some filters actually increased lead levels in tap or well-water sources when used at home rather than reducing them as intended! This means that by using these filters you could actually be exposing yourself to higher levels of lead in your drinking water than before you started filtering it – not exactly what you were hoping for! 

3. Bacterial Growth – It’s possible for bacteria to start growing inside of certain types of filtered pitchers or dispensers over time due to moisture build-up inside them which creates an ideal environment for bacterial growth and contamination of your drinking water supply! Most filters will have instructions on how often they need to be changed so make sure to follow those instructions carefully in order to avoid this dangerous situation from occurring in your own home! 

4. Inadequate Removal Of Contaminants – Some types of filters may not be able to adequately remove all known contaminants from your drinking source even when they are working properly which means that certain chemicals, metals or other pollutants could still end up in your glass when you pour yourself a drink! Be sure to research any filter before buying it so that you know exactly what type(s) of contaminants each specific model is capable (or incapable) of removing so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not this type would work best for your needs! 


All in all, while filtered waters offer convenience they also come with their own set of risks associated with their use - ranging from contamination issues through inadequate removal capabilities - which must be considered before deciding on this option as part of any individual's daily hydration routine!
