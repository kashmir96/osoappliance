## Bringing Lustre Back to Locks 
Do you feel like your hair has lost its luster? Reviving your hair to its former glory and shine can be surprisingly simple. With a few tips and tricks you can have healthy, glossy locks to be envied again. 

As the first step to restoring hair it is essential to pay attention to proper care. The right cleanser and conditioner to meet your individual needs should be used twice each week in combination with an everyday low-sudsing shampoo. After cleansing, use a wet brush or comb and begin at the bottom, working your way up. Once your hair is dry, an adequate protectant should be used when styling to prevent damage from styling tools. Home remedies such as eggs and olive oil can also be used to give hair a deep, sheen-enhancing treatment. 

In addition to home remedies and adequate protection when styling, eating properly can have a huge effect on hair's health. Eating a balanced diet rich in zinc, iron, and biotin, as well as foods high in omega 3 fatty acids can help hair to reach its full potential for sheen and resilience. 

Supplements can also be used to ensure hair receives adequate nutrients. A range of products, including tablets and shampoos, are available on the market that contain key vitamins and minerals said to be essential for luscious locks.

Overall, bringing your hair's shine and luster back to life doesn't need to be expensive or difficult. With a few key steps and proper maintenance, it can be easy to restore hair to its former glory.
