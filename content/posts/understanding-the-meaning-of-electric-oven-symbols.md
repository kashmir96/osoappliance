## Deciphering Electric Oven Symbols
Electric ovens come with countless symbols on their frames and control panels. It can get confusing knowing what all of them mean. To help out, read through for the explanations of these symbols so you can best utilize your electric oven. 

The power symbol looks like a capital letter “I” inside a circle. This means that you can turn the oven on and off with this switch. The temperature knob is a slightly different circle with a line inside. This knob is how you select the temperature for your oven. Depending on the model of oven, this can be anywhere from about 180 degrees up to 500 degrees. 

Another symbol you might find is a triangle with a small line in it. This symbol is mainly used in the convection oven setting and means the fan will turn on when activated. This provides an even heat source throughout the inside of the oven so you don’t have to worry about scorching your food. 

The next symbol is a square with a circle inside of it. This symbol indicates the timer. You can adjust the length of time you wish your food to bake, and the oven will automatically turn off when the time is up. This feature is often combined with a buzzer or chime, alerting you when your food is ready.

The last common symbol is a small dot inside of a square shape. This one is quite useful and stand for the “heat up” feature. When activated the oven will heat up to the desired temperature without having to wait for the oven to reach the temperature that is manually set.
