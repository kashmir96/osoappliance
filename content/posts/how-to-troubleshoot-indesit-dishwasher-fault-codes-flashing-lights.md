## Troubleshooting Indesit Dishwasher Fault Codes

Have you recently noticed that your Indesit dishwasher has blinkinh lights and you're not sure what it means? You’re not alone. Fault codes in dishwashers are often generic or specific to a certain brand, and it can be difficult to know how to respond. Fortunately, troubleshooting Indesit dishwasher fault codes is not that complicated. Here's what you need to know. 

The first step in troubleshooting fault codes is to determine the meaning of the code. If your dishwasher has conspicuous lights flashing, the first thing to do is look up the code and understand the meaning. Depending on the code, it could be an indication of a minor fault or a major one. 

Once you determine the exact meaning of the code, it will become easier to resolve the issue. Many fault codes are simple to troubleshoot and can be quickly resolved with a few simple steps. For example, if the fault has to do with overflowing water, disconnect your dishwasher and make sure no water is present in the machine. 

It is also important to remember that some fault codes are simply a symptom of a much larger malfunction. For example, if your dishwasher’s fault code is ‘water leakage’, the problem could be something like a clogged drain or a faulty water inlet valve. In these cases, you may need to call a professional for help.

Despite their complexities, fault codes in Indesit dishwashers can usually be resolved by following a few simple steps. With the right knowledge, you can determine the exact meaning of the code and quickly find the root of the problem.
