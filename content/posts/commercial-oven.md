A commercial oven is a large appliance used to prepare food in commercial kitchens. These ovens are typically larger and more powerful than residential ovens, and they are designed to handle the high-volume cooking needs of restaurant kitchens. They come in several varieties, including convection, steam, combi and specialty ovens, each of which offers different features that make them ideal for specific types of cooking.

Convection ovens use fans to circulate hot air evenly throughout the cooking chamber for faster and more even baking results. Steam ovens utilize steam injection technology to cook food faster while retaining moisture for enhanced flavor and texture. Combi ovens combine convection heating with steam injection for greater versatility that can be used for baking, steaming or roasting dishes all at once. Specialty ovens can be configured with additional features such as rotisseries or pizza stones to accommodate particular types of cooking tasks. 

Commercial ovens are an essential tool in any restaurant kitchen due to their ability to quickly produce consistently cooked dishes at a large scaleâ€”a capability that would be impossible with residential-grade models alone. They also offer significant energy savings compared to traditional gas or electric ranges since they are designed specifically for the high-heat demands of commercial kitchens. Additionally, many newer models feature digital temperature controls that allow chefs greater control over their cooking processes while reducing energy costs even further by automatically shutting off when not in use. 

In short, commercial ovens are an invaluable piece of equipment needed by any professional chef who wants reliable performance from their kitchen appliances without sacrificing quality or taste in the process!
