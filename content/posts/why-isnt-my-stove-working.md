If your stove isn't working, it could be due to a variety of reasons. The first thing you should do is check the power source. Make sure that the stove is plugged in and that the circuit breaker hasn't been tripped. If the power source is fine, then the problem could be with the stove itself.

When it comes to stoves, there are several potential issues that can cause them not to work properly. The most common issue is a malfunctioning igniter. This can be caused by a faulty spark module, broken igniter wires, or clogged burner ports. If your stove has an electronic ignition system, you may need to replace the spark module or wiring if there's no spark when you turn on the stove.

Other potential causes of a non-working stove include a faulty gas valve or regulator valve, a faulty thermocouple, or a broken thermostat. If your stove runs on natural gas, then it may need to be serviced by a professional technician as these types of repairs can be dangerous and require specialized knowledge and tools. 

Finally, if none of these issues are causing your stove not to work properly, then it may simply be in need of some general maintenance such as cleaning out dust and debris from the burners or replacing worn out parts such as knobs or seals. 

No matter what's causing your stove not to work properly, it's best to have it looked at by an experienced technician who can diagnose and repair the issue quickly and safely so you can get back to cooking!
