When you have a dirty dishwasher that isn’t cleaning dishes properly, it can be incredibly frustrating. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem and get your dishwasher back up and running.

The first step is to check the filter. Over time, the filter can become clogged with food particles, grease, and other debris, which can prevent the dishwasher from properly cleaning dishes. To clean the filter, remove it from the dishwasher and rinse it off under running water. Be sure to also check the spray arms and make sure they are free of any blockages.

If the filter and spray arms are clear, the next step is to check the detergent. Make sure you are using the correct type of detergent and that it is not expired. If you are using a dishwasher-specific detergent, be sure to use the recommended amount. If you are using a regular dish soap, use only a small amount and be sure to rinse off any excess before loading the dishwasher.

If the detergent is not the issue, the next step is to check the water. If the water is not hot enough, it can prevent the detergent from properly cleaning the dishes. Check the temperature of the water entering the dishwasher, and if it is not hot enough, adjust the water heater accordingly.

If none of these steps are successful, it may be time to call a professional. A technician can inspect the dishwasher and determine the source of the problem. In some cases, the dishwasher may need to be replaced.

By following these steps, you should be able to get your dishwasher back up and running and your dishes sparkling clean.
