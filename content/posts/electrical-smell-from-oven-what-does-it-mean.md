## Electrical Odor Coming From Oven: What Causes It?
When an electrical smell inside your oven is present, it is a warning sign that something is wrong and needs to be addressed immediately. Fortunately, an electrical smell from your oven can give you an indication of the source of the problem so you can figure out the best way to repair the issue and make your oven safe to use again.

There are a few potential sources of the odor. It could be caused by a faulty oven element, a faulty wire, burnt food, or a gas leak.

If the smell is coming from a wire or a faulty oven element, it is important to check and make sure that the wire insulation is not deteriorating and that no overpowering is taking place. If damage to the wiring is found, it can lead to an electrical fire, which can be very dangerous. A licensed electrician should be called in to repair any faulty wiring. 

Burnt food can also be a source of the smell. If food burns or is left in the oven and forgotten about, it can create an unpleasant smell that can linger for days. An oven cleaner can help to eliminate the smell if it comes from burnt food.

Finally, an electrical smell can indicate a gas leak. Natural gas is odorless, but many gas companies add a sulfur-based odor to natural gas to make it easier to detect. If you smell a strong sulfurous odor, open the windows and leave the house. Call the gas company to come out and check for leaks immediately.

It is important to stay aware of any odors coming from your appliances, particularly the oven. If a strong electrical smell is present, do not use the oven until the source of the smell has been identified and fixed by a qualified technician.
