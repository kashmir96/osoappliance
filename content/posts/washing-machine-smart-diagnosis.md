In today’s world, smart home technology is becoming increasingly popular. Smart home appliances like washing machines are now equipped with smart diagnosis features that allow them to detect and diagnose problems on their own. This feature eliminates the need to call a technician or service person whenever a problem arises, saving you time and money in the process.

Smart diagnosis is a feature that uses artificial intelligence and digital communication technology to diagnose issues with your washing machine. It can detect problems such as overfilling, incorrect settings, blocked drainage pipes and more. The washer also sends troubleshooting instructions through its app or display so you can make repairs yourself without having to call in an expert.

The first step of the smart diagnosis process is for the appliance to gather information about its environment. It does this by using sensors that measure things like temperature, humidity, water levels and more. Once the data has been collected, it is sent to the manufacturer's cloud platform where it is analyzed by algorithms that search for any potential problems or errors within the system. If a problem is found, then it will be displayed on your app or display along with specific troubleshooting instructions on how to fix it yourself without having to call in an expert service person.

The benefit of using this type of technology is that you don't need to wait for someone else to come out and inspect your washing machine; instead you can do it yourself quickly and easily from the comfort of your own home! Plus, by being able to detect errors before they become major issues you can save time and money by avoiding costly repairs down the line. 

Overall, Smart Diagnosis technology makes it easier than ever before for homeowners to diagnose problems with their washing machines without needing an outside service person's help – saving them time and money in the process!
