## Understanding the Benefits of Electric Range Hood Clearance 
Are you looking to upgrade your kitchen appliances with improved, energy efficient models? When considering new additions, making sure you think about electric range hood clearance is a must. In this blog, we'll discuss the benefits of electric range hood clearance and why it's important to take into consideration when looking to upgrade your kitchen.

Electric range hoods come in a variety of designs and can provide your kitchen with powerful extra ventilation. Their primary benefit is clear — they help vent smoke, grease and other particles from the air in your kitchen. But there's an additional, important factor to consider — electric range hood clearance is also important for helping to prevent fires. The clearance between the hood and the surface of the range or cooktop protects against fire as well as other unwanted heat and smoke conditions. 

Beyond its importance for safety, electric range hood clearance is also vital for helping to maximize the effectiveness of the hood in ventilating hot air, steam, and smoke from your kitchen. Keep in mind that electric range hoods should not be placed too close to the surface of the range, as this can cause them to operate at a lower capacity and not live up to their true potential.

Electric range hoods are vital appliances for a smoke-free and safe environment in your kitchen. As you look to upgrade your appliances, it's important to take electric range hood clearance into consideration to ensure your hood is properly and safely installed.
