## Maximizing Profits Through Smart Recycling

When it comes to making money on a small scale, recycling can be an easy way to make a few extra bucks. While recycling just paper, plastic, and glass may be all youâ€™ve considered before, there are additional items you should add to the list to make your efforts more profitable. 

Here are the 5 most profitable things to recycle:

1. Ink Cartridges

Ink cartridges from printers and fax machines can be recycled for cash. Many retailers will pay for used ink cartridges and some community donation centers may accept used cartridges as well.

2. Scrap Metal

Scrap metal from old appliances, furniture, bicycles, and other items that can be broken down for spare parts are valuable and can be recycled for a profit. Contact local scrap yards for details on acceptable items and pricing.

3. Cell Phones

Cell phones contain valuable parts, and many retailers accept donated cell phones. Simply make sure that all of your personal data is erased from the device.

4. Electronics

Old or broken electronics such as computers, speakers, and gaming consoles contain valuable parts that can be recycled for cash. Check with local recycling centers in your area for details.

5. Cardboard

Cardboard boxes, usually found on the sides of streets in many cities, can be recycled for cash. Check with local recycling centers for details on pickup, pricing, and accepted items.

Recycling is an easy way to make a few extra bucks and help the environment at the same time. It is important to note that some items such as batteries and car parts cannot be recycled, but they do have other options. Contact your local recycling center or waste management company for details on these items.
