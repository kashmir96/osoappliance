Maybe you want something more powerful? The Cuisinart 4-in-1 Griddler is perfect for those who love cooking up burgers and sandwiches without having to dirty multiple pans or skillets. This griddle is equipped with four different plates – one for grilling burgers, one for grilling veggies, one for paninis and sandwiches, and one reversible plate that can switch from flat top griddling style cooking to ridged grilling style cooking! 

Finally if you're looking for an air fryer then check out the PowerXL Pro Air Fryer Oven Deluxe 7 QT model – this air fryer is large enough to fit whole chickens or racks of ribs while also featuring pre-programmed settings that take all the guesswork out of frying foods perfectly every time!
