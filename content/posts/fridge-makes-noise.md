Fridge makes noise and it is an annoying sound that can drive you crazy especially at night. It can be caused by a number of different problems, from the fan motor to the compressor, and can range from a low humming sound to a loud grinding noise. If your fridge is making noise, it’s important to figure out what’s causing it so you can fix the problem or call in a repair serviceman if necessary. 

The first step is to identify where the noise is coming from. Check the back of your fridge near the motor and compressor for any obvious signs of damage or wear. If you don’t find anything there, then move on to checking other areas such as around doors and hinges, seals, condenser coils, defrost timer and evaporator fan motor. 

Once you have identified which part/component is causing the noise then you should try troubleshooting it yourself before calling in a repair serviceman. Some common causes include: 
- The fan motor could be malfunctioning due to worn bearings or blades not spinning properly; this could cause loud grinding noises or humming noises depending on how bad it has gotten. 
- The condenser coils may need cleaning as dirt buildup will cause them to become inefficient; this will result in louder than normal running sounds from your fridge. 
- The door seals could be loose or worn out which will also lead to rattling noises when opening/closing doors on your fridge; check these for any tears/rips and replace them if necessary (this should fix most rattling issues). You may also want to inspect hinges for wear or misalignment as this too can lead to noisy operations when opening/closing doors on your refrigerator unit. 
- Lastly, there could be an issue with your defrost timer; if this component malfunctions it may cause ticking noises which are normally heard during defrost cycles (usually once every 10-12 hours). To fix this problem yourself simply replace the timer with a new one that matches its specs (size & model). 

Taking these steps should allow you diagnose most common issues that make fridges noisy but if all else fails then contacting a repair serviceman would be best advised in order ensure proper repairs are made safely & correctly!
