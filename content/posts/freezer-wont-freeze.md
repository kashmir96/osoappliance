# Freezer wont freeze

If your freezer isn’t freezing, it can be a major inconvenience. Not only will you have to throw out all the food that has gone bad, but you won’t be able to store any new food until the issue is resolved. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to try and fix the problem yourself before calling in a professional.

First, check to make sure that the temperature setting on your freezer is set correctly. If it is too low, it may not be cold enough to freeze your food. If this doesn’t solve the problem, then check for any blockages in the vents or coils of your freezer. Dust or debris can prevent air from circulating properly and cause your freezer not to freeze.

Next, check the door seals. If they are loose or worn out, cold air may be escaping and causing your freezer to not freeze. Make sure all the seals are tight and secure. If they need to be replaced, you can find replacements at most hardware stores.

Finally, make sure that your freezer is getting enough power. Check the outlet it is plugged into and make sure it’s working properly. If not, try plugging it into a different outlet or using a surge protector to ensure it’s getting enough power.

If these steps don’t work, then it may be time to call a professional for help. They will be able to diagnose the issue and recommend a solution. It could be something as simple as replacing a part or as complex as replacing an entire compressor unit. Either way, getting professional help is usually the best way to get your freezer back up and running again quickly and safely.
