When it comes to purchasing a commercial dryer, the cost can be a major factor in deciding which one is right for you. Commercial dryers are designed to handle large amounts of laundry and can range from basic models to more advanced units with multiple features. Prices vary depending on size, type, brand, and features.

Basic models with limited features start at around $500 and go up from there depending on your needs. These basic models are typically coin-operated or have manual controls with no digital displays or sophisticated functions. They also tend to be smaller in size compared to higher-end models, making them ideal for small businesses that don't need the capacity of a larger machine.

Mid-range commercial dryers offer more options and generally cost between $1,000-$3,000. These machines usually come equipped with digital displays that allow you to customize settings like temperature and cycle times as well as additional features such as built-in lint filters or energy efficient designs. Mid-range models also tend to be larger than entry level versions so they can accommodate heavier loads while still providing an efficient drying cycle time. 

High end commercial dryers offer all the bells and whistles ranging from $3,500-$8,000+. These machines come equipped with multiple programmable cycles tailored for different types of fabrics as well as additional safety measures like locking doors or automatic shutoff switches when the door is left open too long during operation. Many high end commercial dryers are connected directly into the building's plumbing system for easy draining of water after each cycle which increases efficiency even further by reducing labor costs associated with emptying out collection tanks manually each day or week depending on usage levels.. 
 
Ultimately choosing a commercial dryer will depend on your budget as well as what type of business you operate and how much laundry needs to be done each day or week in order to determine what model would best suit your needs without breaking the bank!
