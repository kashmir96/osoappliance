## Guide to Fix 5e Error Code on a Samsung Washer
Are you having trouble solving the 5e error code on your Samsung washer? We're here to help! Read on for step-by-step instructions on how to resolve this problem easily and quickly.

The 5e error code denotes a drain-related problem. This could mean a clog, kink, or foreign object trapped in the drain hose or a unit that is not sealing properly. 

To fix this error, first unplug your Samsung washer and check for any kinks or obstructions in the drain hose. If there are any, straighten them out. Then, check the drain pump filter for any debris or foreign objects and remove them. If the drain pump is defective, it may need to be replaced. 

Next, make sure the drain hose is properly connected and that the unit is level. The washer should not be tilted or raised off the ground by more than 1/2 inch. To do this, use a level or a carpenter’s level.

Also check to see if the drain hose is installed correctly. Make sure it isn’t kinked, crushed or clogged. It should be placed 4 to 6 inches above the floor and it should not be higher than the maximum marked on the hose.

Finally, check the washer's wiring and connections. Make sure they are all properly connected and not damaged.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully resolve the 5e error code issue on your Samsung washer. To avoid such issues, regularly inspect and clean the drain hose, and make sure all connections are secure and undamaged.
