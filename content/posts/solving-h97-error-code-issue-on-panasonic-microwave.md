## Resolving H97 Code on Panasonic Microwaves
Panasonic microwaves offer a variety of convenience and safety features to make your life easier while cooking. That being said, an error code can be encountered when something goes wrong, one of the most common being the H97 error code. We have compiled some of the most common steps for resolving this error to get you back to cooking. 

Whenever the H97 error code appears on a Panasonic microwave, it signifies that there is a problem with the door. If it is not fully closed, or there is something that is keeping it from properly latching, then you will get this code. 

The first step is to check the latch and make sure the door is securely closed. Make sure that nothing is preventing it from latching securely. If something is preventing the door from closing, then remove the obstacle before continuing. 

If the door is securely closed and the code persists, then it's time to take a look at the door switch itself. This switch will normally be located near the latch and should be tested using a multimeter. If you are not comfortable with doing this, it is probably a good idea to have this done by a qualified engineer or appliance repair technician. 

If at any time when performing these checks your microwave shows any other error codes, make sure to consult with the user manual or contact a qualified professional before continuing. 

If all of these checks have passed and you get the same H97 error code, then it is likely that either the door switch or latch itself will need to be replaced. This type of repair should only be attempted by a qualified engineer/appliance repair technician, as incorrect installation/fitting of these components could lead to an unsafe environment for use.

Resolving an H97 error code on a Panasonic microwave doesn’t have to be complicated. With a few simple checks, and the right expert, you should be back up and running in no time.
