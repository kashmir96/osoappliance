## Toast Troubles Don't Have To Toast Your Day

Toaster issues can be a real day ruiner, especially when you have been looking forward to that late-morning slice of toast. But with a few simple solutions, you can often quickly identify and repair the problems that can occur with a toaster, and get your toast back on track. 

One of the most common issues with toasters is a broken wire or worn connection. Check all exposed wires for rust, damage or fraying and if present, use a multi-meter to check for continuity. If no continuity is found, the wire may need to be replaced. Additionally, check all connections for wear or corrosion and secure as needed.

Sometimes the toaster will fail to heat as desired, or will not heat at all. In this case, the heating element may need to be replaced. This is a relatively simple process which can be completed with an ordinary screwdriver and basic work gloves. Disconnect any power sources to the device, then locate and remove the screws that hold the heating element in place. Replace the element, then reattach all of the screws before reinstalling power to the device.

Finally, occasional jams can prevent your toast from popping up. To stop further jams, make sure you are only inserting the approved sized slices of bread and there are no objects other than the toast inside the toaster. If the problem persists, you can use a long-handled object or gripper to safely remove anything that may have gotten stuck in the toaster.

With just a few basic checks and solutions, you can quickly repair your toaster and get your morning toast back on track. If youâ€™re still in need of assistance, you can find a reliable repair technician in your area through our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).

## Don't Let Toaster Issues Toast Your Day - FAQ's
1. What should I do if my toaster is sparking or smoking?
If your toaster is sparking or smoking, you should unplug the toaster immediately and contact a qualified service technician to assess the device.

2. What should I do if the toaster won't stay down?
If the toaster arm is not staying down when the toast is finished, try turning the toaster dial to its lowest setting first. If this isn't successful, the tension springs in the toaster may need to be adjusted. We advise contacting a qualified service technician if this is the case. 

3. How often should I clean my toaster?
Regular cleaning of your toaster will keep it in good working order. At minimum, we suggest cleaning the outside of the toaster and the crumb trays once a month. If you notice any buildup of debris or crumbs, clean this immediately to prevent issues with the toaster.

4. What should I do if my toaster won't stay plugged in?
If your toaster is not staying plugged in, check the power cord to make sure it is secure. If the cord is not securely connected, cut off the old plug, strip the ends of the wires, put the wires through the plug, and twist the ends of the wires back together. Tuck the wires into the plug and then secure with a screw. 

5. Can I use aluminum foil inside my toaster?
No, using aluminum foil inside the toaster can cause sparking, dangerous electric shock, and damage the toaster. We advise against using any foreign items inside the toaster.
