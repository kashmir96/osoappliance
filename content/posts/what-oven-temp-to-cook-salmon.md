Cooking salmon in the oven is a great way to ensure your fish is cooked perfectly. The key to making sure your salmon turns out juicy and flaky is getting the temperature just right.

When baking salmon, it’s important to use an oven preheated to 350°F (177°C). This temperature will produce a moist and tender piece of fish that’s not overcooked or dry. You can also opt for a slightly higher temperature if you want your salmon to be crispier on the outside. For example, 375°F (190°C) will give you a slightly more golden-brown finish, while 400°F (204°C) will give you an even crispier exterior.

If you’re baking an especially thick piece of salmon, you may need to increase the cooking time or lower the temperature slightly. A thicker piece of fish may require 15-20 minutes at 325-350°F (163-177°C) instead of 10-15 minutes at 350-400°F (177-204°C). You can also cover your pan with aluminum foil for part of the cooking time if it appears like it’s browning too quickly on top before it’s cooked through inside.

No matter which temperature you choose, make sure to check for doneness by inserting an instant read thermometer into the thickest part of the fish. It should read 145ºF (63ºC) when it’s ready to eat. If not, return it to the oven for another few minutes and check again until it reaches this temperature. Enjoy!
