## Enjoy the Ease and Convenience of a Non Electric Rice Cooker
Though the popularity of electric rice cookers continues to grow, there are still many advantages that come with using non electric rice cookers. Cooking rice with a non electric rice cooker is simple and convenient to get delicious, fluffy results.

Non electric rice cookers provide a more traditional way to cook rice that has been perfected over centuries. The rice cooker's shape is designed to capture the steam and heat of the cooking process, ensuring that the rice is cooked evenly. This even heating and trapping of moisture also retain health benefits, as the vitamins and minerals contained in the rice are retained better than if the rice were boiled or steamed.

The ease of use with a non electric rice cooker is unparalleled. With only a few simple steps and no need to monitor the cooker or have access to electricity, a perfect pot of rice can be achieved. All that is needed is to measure the amount of rice to be cooked, rinse, add the preferred amount of water, and set the cooker to the desired temperature setting, and let it cook.

Finally, non electric rice cookers have the advantage of being extremely lightweight, meaning they can be taken with you or used wherever there is a heat source. This makes them great for camping and picnics, or to bring along with you when travelling.
