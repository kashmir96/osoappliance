## Unusual Noises from Your Washing Machine

Do you find yourself wondering why your washing machine is making an unusual noise when it is in spin cycle? It can be a challenge to figure out what the root cause of the issue is. In this blog post, we will discuss some of the potential reasons why a tvashing machine becomes noisy when in spin cycle as well as provide suggestions on how to fix it. 

The spinning cycle of a washing machine requires a lot of energy and a great amount of torque. As a result, it is possible for the machine’s components to become loose and create a lot of vibration. This could be caused by a loose belt, a worn-out suspension spring, or an unbalanced drum. In addition, an uneven load could be the culprit for the additional noise when spinning. This can be caused by too much detergent, improper loading of clothes, or unbalanced items that do not evenly distribute in the washer drum. 

Luckily, there are a few things that you can do to fix the noisy washing machine. First, make sure that you keep an eye on the tub for any loose components or parts. This can be an easy fix that doesn’t require professional help. Secondly, you can try to redistribute the clothes inside the tub. This ensures that the load is evenly balanced and the clothes completely fill the washing machine drum. Lastly, you can try to adjust the spin cycle settings to see if that helps to reduce or eliminate the noise caused by the washing machine. 

In conclusion, a noisy washing machine can be caused by several different things. Keeping the machine well-maintained, checking for any loose parts that could be causing the noise, redistributing the load, and adjusting the settings of the spin cycle are all great ways to try to fix the noise before having to make a visit to a repair technician. 

If you are still experiencing loud noises when running your washing machine and all of the above-mentioned methods have not helped, it may be time to contact a [local appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). They will be able to assess the issue and diagnose the noise’s origin, as well as provide a solution to the problem.
