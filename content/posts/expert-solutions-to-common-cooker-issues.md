## Expert Solutions for Common Cooker Problems
The cooking process should be a relatively simple task: throw some ingredients into a pot, set the timer, and wait. What follows should be a delicious, well cooked meal. Unfortunately, things don’t always turn out to be this easy and cooker problems can arise. 

The most common cooker issues include burnt food, uneven temperatures and food not cooking in the right amount of time. When these issues arise, most individuals are left to troubleshoot without any guidance or help. While there are many causes for these cooking issues, there are some general solutions that can address each problem. 

A common issue is the cooker gets too hot or burnt food. This can be caused by several different problems. One potential cause can be the glaze of the cooker has been damaged. When the glaze of the cooker is damaged, heat can escape through the gaps and cause the food to burn. To address this issue, the glaze of the cooker should be inspected and replaced if damaged. 

Another common issue is when the food cooks unevenly in the cooker. This can generally be caused by a faulty thermostat in your cooker. A faulty thermostat can cause uneven temperatures within the cooker, preventing the food from cooking evenly. To address this issue, the thermostat needs to be replaced. 

The last issue is the food not cooking in the right amount of time. This can generally be caused by a clogged burner vent. The burner vent allows the heat from the burner to circulate, so if it becomes blocked or clogged, it will prevent the proper air flow and can cause the food to not cook in the proper amount of time. To address this issue, the burner vent needs to be properly cleaned and unblocked.

These are some common cooker issues and their corresponding solutions. If you’re having difficulty with your cooker and these techniques do not work, it’s best to contact an appliance repair technician to help you.
