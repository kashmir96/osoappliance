Cooking up a smoothie with your KitchenAid K400 Blender is a breeze! With the right accessories, you can make delicious drinks, breakfast foods, and more with this versatile appliance. Whether you’re looking to experiment with new recipes or just make quick and easy treats for your family, these accessories will help you get the most from your blender. 

First off, an extra-large blending and chopping bowl will come in handy for larger batches of food. The large capacity makes it easier to whip up foods like guacamole or pesto in one go. If you’d like to customize the size of your blending bowl, a set of graduated containers is also available. This way, you can blend different sized servings without having to clean out each bowl individually. 

The K400 Blender also comes with a variable-speed control dial that allows you to adjust the speed according to what recipe you’re making. To take full advantage of this feature and create more complex textures in your food, consider investing in an accessory like spiralizer discs or shredding blades for cutting thin strips of vegetables or cheeses into salads and soups. You can also turn fresh fruits into sorbets using a frozen dessert maker attachment that fits onto the blender base as well! 

Finally, if you’re looking for convenience while blending drinks like shakes or smoothies on-the-go, get yourself a travel cup adapter kit so that all those delicious beverages don't have to go waste after they're made! With this kit comes two cups along with lids – one large cup perfect for creating big batches of blended drinks and another smaller cup that’s great for single servings when traveling away from home. 

Overall, upgrading your KitchenAid K400 Blender experience doesn’t have to be complicated when there are plenty of accessories available on the market today. From graduated blending bowls for customized portion sizes, attachments that enable different textures in food prep all the way down convenience items such as travel adapters – there truly is something here for everyone!
