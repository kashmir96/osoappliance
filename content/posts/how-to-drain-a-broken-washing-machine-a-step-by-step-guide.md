## A Guide to Draining a Faulty Washing Machine

When your washing machine breaks down, it’s essential to understand how to safely drain it. This not only helps you minimize damage to the appliance but is important for preventing the growth of mould or bad odours within the machine. To help you out, we’ve put together this guide on how to safely drain a faulty washing machine. 

#### Step 1: Unplug the Appliance

Before you do anything else, make sure that the washing machine is unplugged. This will ensure that you don’t get an electric shock while you’re working.

#### Step 2: Move the Washing Machine

Now that the machine is unplugged, you’ll need to move it so you can access the back of it. Grab a helper or use furniture sliders to move it to another spot in the room where you can work comfortably.

#### Step 3: Remove the Hoses

On the back of the washing machine, you should see two hoses — a cold and a hot water hose. Disconnect these hoses and ensure that you place them somewhere that any water will not damage your home.

#### Step 4: Drain the Water

You should now be able to see a plastic pipe on the back of the washing machine. Place your drain pan or bucket under this pipe, and then use a flat head screwdriver to remove the cap. This will allow all the remaining water to come out of the washing machine. Wait for the water to finish draining before removing the drain pan or bucket.

#### Step 5: Replace the Cap

Once all the water has drained, make sure to put the cap back on the pipe. This will help prevent water from leaking sporadically when the machine is in use. 

#### Conclusion

Thankfully, draining a broken washing machine isn’t as hard as it seems. As long as you follow the steps outlined above and take the necessary safety precautions, you should be able to safely and quickly drain your washing machine.
