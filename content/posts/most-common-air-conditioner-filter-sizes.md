Air conditioner filters come in a variety of sizes to fit the many different types and models of air conditioners. The size of the filter is determined by the size of the air conditioning unit’s return duct, which is usually located on the side or back of the unit. Here are some common sizes for air conditioner filters: 

20x20x1 - This is one of the most common filter sizes and fits in many types and models of residential air conditioning units.

16x25x1 - This size fits in smaller residential units such as window-mounted or wall-mounted ACs, as well as some larger commercial units.

14x25x1 - This filter size can be used in window-mounted ACs, wall-mounted ACs, and larger commercial units. 

18x24x1 - This filter size is designed for use with mini split systems, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. 

12x12x1 - This size can be found in many portable ACs that are designed for temporary use or smaller spaces such as dorm rooms or apartments. 

It’s important to check your manufacturer’s specifications before purchasing an air conditioner filter to make sure you get one that fits your specific model properly. Many online stores carry a wide variety of filters so you should have no problem finding one that meets your needs!
