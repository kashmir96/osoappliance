The kitchen appliance trend for 2022 is all about the colors of nature. Think soft blues, greens, and greys that will bring a touch of the outdoors right into your home. These colors are perfect for creating a calming atmosphere, while still giving your kitchen a modern and stylish look.

One of the most popular appliance colors for 2022 is blue. Blues from light to deep navy can be used to create a fresh, sophisticated look in any kitchen. Blue appliances are also great for pairing with other colors like white or grey, making it easy to create an inviting space that feels both cozy and modern at the same time.

Green is another one of 2022’s top appliance colors, and it’s perfect for creating a natural feel in your kitchen. From olive green to seafoam green, these shades are ideal for creating an earthy yet modern vibe in any home. Green appliances pair beautifully with wood tones or neutral hues like white or beige, adding just enough color without feeling overwhelming. 

Grey is also very on-trend this year when it comes to kitchen appliances - from soft greys to charcoal shades - grey can provide an elegant yet understated look that’s perfect for any home design style. Greys look great when paired with other neutrals like white and black and even pastels like pink or yellow! 

Overall, nature-inspired colors like blue, green, and grey will be some of the most popular appliance shades in 2022 - perfect for creating an inviting atmosphere that feels fresh yet timeless at the same time!
