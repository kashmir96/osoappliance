If your dryer is making loud noises, it can be a real nuisance. Fortunately, not all noises indicate a major problem that requires professional repair. In some cases, you may be able to fix the issue yourself with a few simple steps. 

Common Causes of Loud Dryers 
The most common cause of a noisy dryer is a worn drum bearing. This can produce an annoying squeaking or squealing sound as the drum rotates on its bearings during operation. Other possible causes include worn out rollers and idler pulleys, misaligned belt tension, or worn motor bearings. 

How to Fix It Yourself 
Fortunately, many of these issues are easy to fix at home before calling in an appliance technician for repairs. Here’s how to troubleshoot and fix common problems that lead to loud dryers: 

 • Check the lint trap – Clogged lint traps can trap air inside the machine and cause it to vibrate more than usual while running; clean out the lint trap regularly for optimal performance

 • Adjust belt tension – If your dryer’s drive belt is too loose or tight, it can cause extra noise when in use; adjust according to manufacturer instructions

 • Replace worn Roller Wheels & Idler Pulley – Worn roller wheels and idler pulleys will result in excessive noise; replace them if they appear cracked or damaged

 • Clean any debris from inside the drum– Debris such as coins or other small objects left behind from previous loads can cause rattles and bumps while drying; vacuum them out for smoother operation 

 • Replace worn Drum Bearing - If all else fails and you still hear squealing coming from your machine then you may need to replace the drum bearing; these are available at any appliance parts store 

Hopefully these tips have helped you pinpoint what’s causing your dryer’s loud noises so that you can get it fixed quickly and easily! Unless you feel confident about replacing parts yourself then we suggest calling an experienced repairman who knows exactly how to resolve any problems with your specific model of machine.
