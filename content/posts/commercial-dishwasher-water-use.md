Water efficiency is an important factor to consider when selecting a commercial dishwasher, as it can help reduce water and energy costs over the long-term. Commercial dishwashers typically use less water than handwashing dishes since they are designed to efficiently clean large quantities of dishes while using minimal amounts of water.

The majority of commercial dishwashers use between one and three gallons of water per cycle, depending on the type and size of the model. The most efficient dishwashers are capable of cleaning up to 200 racks, or 2,000 dishes in an hour with just one gallon of water per cycle. This is often achieved by strategically placing multiple nozzles around the machine that spray high-pressure streams of hot water onto each rack in succession. 

In addition, many commercial dishwasher models feature advanced technology like built-in rinse aids that help reduce the amount of rinse cycles needed per cycle, thereby reducing overall water consumption. Furthermore, most models feature built-in sensors that detect when all dishes have been cleaned so that no more cycles are run unnecessarily. 

Overall, it is important to select a commercial dishwasher with features that maximize energy and cost savings while still providing sufficient cleaning power for your needs. By doing so, you can save money on energy bills and also ensure that your kitchen staff has access to clean dishes without wasting valuable resources like time or money on inefficient machines or processes.
