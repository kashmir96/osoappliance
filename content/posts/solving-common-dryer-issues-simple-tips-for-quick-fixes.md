## Simple Solutions for Common Dryer Issues to Get You Back on Track
For those of us with dryers in our homes, it can be a major inconvenience when something isn't working. Dryers are a useful tool, however they’re also capable of causing a hassle when they start acting up. Thankfully, there are some simple solutions that homeowners can use to try and solve common dryer issues. 

The first and most important tip is to check the vents; if they’re blocked, the dryer will take much longer (or longer than usual) to dry a load of clothing. Make sure to check them periodically and clean them out as needed. Additionally, you may need to check and clean out the lint trap, which can also become blocked and impair the dryer’s performance. 

If the dryer is still experiencing problems, then it may be time for some troubleshooting. Curiously, some dryers won't operate correctly until the start button is pushed multiple times. This could be a sign that the timer motor is faulty and will need to be replaced. It could also be an indication that the start switch is on the fritz and needs to be replaced. 

The heating element is also something to look out for. If the dryer is running and not producing heat, the heat element will need to be checked. It may need to be replaced depending on the age and type of the dryer. If the heating element fails, it’s important to take it to a repairman as soon as possible.

Finally, thermal fuses are another component of dryers that can cause issues. The thermal fuse is usually located near the heating element and it trips when the temperature becomes too high. If the fuse trips, your dryer will stop working and you’ll need to replace it.

These are just some of the simple solutions for common dryer issues. Having a regular maintenance routine is the best way to avoid these issues and keep your dryer running efficiently. If you encounter an issue that requires a repairman, the [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) on our website can help connect you to a specialist in your area.

## Common Dryer Issues: FAQ

**Q: Why isn't my dryer turning on?**

A: This can be caused by a few different things. Check to make sure that the machine is plugged in and the outlet is working properly. Additionally, it could be caused by a faulty thermostat or thermal fuse. If the problem persists, it may be a good idea to consult a professional for help. 

**Q: How can I stop my clothes from coming out wrinkled?**

A: Start by setting your dryer to the appropriate setting for each type of clothing. If you have heavier items such as jeans or sweaters, it's best to use the permanent press setting. Additionally, if your dryer has a no-heat fluff setting, use that for items like delicate knits and synthetic fabrics so they don't get damaged. 

**Q: How can I prevent my dryer from over heating?**

A: Make sure to always clean the lint filter before and after each load of laundry. Replace any old or damaged lint traps or filters with fresh ones as needed. Additionally, make sure there is ample conditioning and ventilation in the area surrounding your dryer so it can function properly. 

**Q: Why are some of my pieces of clothing coming out stretched?**

A: This can happen if items get caught up in the drum and are subjected to too much tumbling. Check that you are properly sorting clothes by fabric type and size. Avoid overloading the dryer; it's better to dry a few lightly loaded loads then one big one. 

**Q: Does using a dryer sheet help reduce static?**

A: Yes, dryer sheets are effective at combating static cling as they contain positively-charged ingredients. Adding a dryer sheet to your load of fabrics can help reduce static and leave your clothes feeling softer.
