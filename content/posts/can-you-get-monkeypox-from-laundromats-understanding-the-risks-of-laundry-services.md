## Can You Get Monkeypox from Laundromats? Understanding the Risks of Laundry Services

Whether you’re a college student living in a dorm, or a family living in an apartment complex, shared laundry facilities can be a convenient amenity. But is it safe to use these public laundromats and dryers? What are the risks of using them? 

One potential risk associated with public laundry facilities is monkeypox. This rare viral infection is caused by the monkeypox virus and can cause fever, swollen lymph nodes, and skin rash. It spreads through direct contact with an infected person or animal, as well as through contaminated objects such as clothing or bedding. While there have not been any reported cases in people who used public laundromats, there have been reports of infection occurring among healthcare workers who had contact with clothing that had been used by patients with monkeypox. 

The good news is that while there are risks associated with using public laundromats, they’re not significant enough to stop people from taking advantage of this convenient amenity. To minimize your risk of infection while using these services: 
* Always wear protective gear such as gloves when handling laundry items in shared spaces 
* Wash your hands thoroughly after handling dirty clothes 
* Avoid touching surfaces within the laundromat (including machines) if possible 

Although washing clothes at home may be more convenient than using a shared facility for some people – particularly those who live alone - renting an appliance like a washer or dryer has its own set of benefits. Not only do renters benefit from being able to wash their clothes without having to leave their homes but they also have access to modern appliances and energy efficient technology - something that many public laundry rooms lack due to their age and constant wear-and-tear from multiple users over time .
