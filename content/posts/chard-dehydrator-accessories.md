Dehydrators are great appliances for making dried fruits, vegetables and more. They can also be used to make jerky and other snacks. But to get the most out of your dehydrator, you need the right accessories. Here are some of the must-have dehydrator accessories that will help you get the most out of your appliance:

1. Dehydrator Sheets and Trays: These trays and sheets are made specifically for use in a food dehydrator and provide an ideal surface on which to place food items. The sheets are often made from non-stick materials such as silicone or nylon mesh, while the trays come in many sizes to accommodate different shapes and sizes of foods.

2. Temperature Controls: Most modern dehydrators come with a variety of temperature settings, allowing you to adjust how hot or cold your appliance runs so that you can find the perfect balance for whatever food item you’re drying. If your model doesn’t have adjustable temperatures, look into purchasing a separate temperature control device that can be plugged into your machine.

3. Timers: Setting timers on a dehydrator allows for precise drying times when making dried fruits or vegetables, as well as jerky or other snacks with just the press of a button — no guesswork required! Many models come with timers pre-installed; however, if yours doesn’t have one built-in, it pays to invest in an external timer for convenience and accuracy when drying different types of food items at different temperatures for varying lengths of time.

4. Drying Racks/Shelves: If your model has multiple shelves or racks inside it (which is usually the case), these accessories will ensure even air circulation inside so that all food items dry evenly throughout their dehydration process — essential when making jerky or any other snack requiring uniform texture throughout! It's also great if you plan on drying multiple items at once but don't want them sticking together during dehydration due to lack of airflow in between them — racks provide enough space between items without causing them to stick together during dehydration process as they would if placed directly against each other without adequate airflow around them! 

With these four essential dehydrator accessories on hand, you’ll be able get more out of this handy kitchen appliance than ever before! From perfectly dried fruits and vegetables through to delicious jerky treats – they'll help ensure every batch is just right every single time!
