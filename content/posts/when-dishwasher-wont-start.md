If you're having a problem getting your dishwasher to start, you're not alone. It's one of the most common problems homeowners face with their appliances. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue and potentially get your dishwasher running again.

First, check the power source. Make sure that the dishwasher is plugged in and that the circuit breaker hasnâ€™t been tripped. If it has been tripped, reset it and try starting the dishwasher again.

Next, check for any blockages in the door latch or spray arms. A blockage can prevent the door from closing properly, preventing it from starting. You'll also want to make sure that there are no kinks in the water lines leading to or from your dishwasher as this can also prevent proper operation.

If these checks don't help, then you may need to look at resetting your dishwasher's control board or replacing its heating element if it has one. If all else fails, consult an appliance repair professional for help diagnosing and fixing your dishwasher's issue
