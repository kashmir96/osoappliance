## Can You Get Bed Bugs from Laundromats: Understanding the Risks of Laundry Services 

If you’re like most people, you make regular visits to the laundromat or have a laundry service pick up and drop off your clothes. But is there a risk of getting bed bugs when using these services? Fortunately, the answer is no. Bed bugs are not typically found in laundromats, and it’s highly unlikely that they will be transferred to your clothes while they are being washed. 

However, that doesn't mean all laundromats are completely bug-free. There may be other pests such as cockroaches or silverfish lurking around that could potentially attach themselves to clothing. To avoid this risk, always check for signs of pests before putting your clothes into washers or dryers at a laundromat. And if possible try and use one with updated machines and good overall cleanliness ratings from customers who have used it in the past. 

It's also important to consider where exactly you're hanging out while waiting for your laundry at a laundromat--such as couches or chairs--as these can sometimes harbor bed bugs or other insects if not properly maintained by management staff regularly. Always inspect any furniture before sitting down on it, especially if there are signs of wear like stains or rips in the fabric which can attract pests looking for hiding spots away from plain sight 

When using laundry services such risks become much lower since they usually deliver cleaned and sterilized linen directly to your home which eliminates any chances of contact with bedbugs outside sources during transit period . 

Overall understanding what potential risks exist around public laundry facilities is essential in protecting yourself and making sure you don't bring anything back home with you after washing clothes at public venues .
