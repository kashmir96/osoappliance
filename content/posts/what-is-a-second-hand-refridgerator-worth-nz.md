# What is a second hand refridgerator worth nz

If you’re in the market for a second-hand refrigerator in New Zealand, you’re in luck. The country has a wide variety of options to choose from, and the price you can expect to pay can vary significantly.

So, what is a second hand refrigerator worth in New Zealand? The answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including the age, model, condition, and size of the refrigerator. Generally, you can expect to pay between $200 and $800 for a second-hand refrigerator in New Zealand depending on these factors.

Age is one of the biggest factors that will determine the price of a second-hand refrigerator. Older models tend to cost less as they may not have all the latest features or energy efficiency ratings. Newer models, on the other hand, will usually cost more but may include features such as energy efficient ratings, ice makers, and water dispensers.

The model of the refrigerator is also important. Although some models will be more expensive than others, the overall condition of the refrigerator will also need to be taken into consideration. If the refrigerator is in good condition, you can expect to pay more for it.

Style is another, although less important, factor in determining the cost of a second-hand refrigerator. Refrigerators come in a variety of styles, including top-freezer, bottom-freezer, side-by-side, and four-door styles. The style you choose will influence the cost of the refrigerator.

Features such as ice makers, water dispensers, and energy efficiency ratings can also add to the cost of a second-hand refrigerator. Depending on the model, these features may be available for an additional cost.

Colour and external materials also play a role, stainless vs white or other materials come into play when considering a second-hand refrigerator. However, these features are typically secondary to age, model, and condition when it comes to price. 

In terms of size, the larger the refrigerator, the more you can expect to pay. A refrigerator that is too large for your needs will be more expensive than one that is the right size for your needs.

Ultimately, the price of a second-hand refrigerator in New Zealand will depend on the age, model, condition, and size of the refrigerator. It is important to do your research and shop around to make sure you get the best deal.
