## Finding the Ideal Washing Machine for Your Home

When it comes to doing laundry, finding the perfect washing machine can be overwhelming. With so many makes and models available, how do you know which one is right for you? Here we'll discuss a few general tips when it comes to picking the ideal washing machine for you and your lifestyle, as well as a few of our overall favorites.

When it comes to selecting a washing machine, the main considerations should come down to size, space, program settings, and price. If you're short on space and have a couple of small children in the family, then a simple top-loading machine might be all you need. But if your family is larger, you may benefit from seeking out a large capacity machine that can fit more clothing and bedding.

Program settings can also be important. Regardless of the size or price of your washing machine, it's essential that you familiarize yourself with its specific settings to ensure that you don't overwork or overspend or damage your clothes in the process.

Finally, the price should also be taken into consideration. It's important to research the features you need and compare those features with the washing machines available in your budget.

We recently reviewed a few of our top overall favorites, and here they are:

**LG WM3900HWA Washing Machine:** This top-loading machine has a high capacity, advanced sanitation settings, and TurboWash technology, making it one of the more versatile machines out there. It comes with a steep price tag, but you'll get plenty of bang for your buck.

**GE GFW450SSKWW Washing Machine:** This classic front-loading washing machine is incredibly efficient and comes with an Energy Star rating to prove it. With a mid-range price and great capacity, it also has a few extra features to make your laundry day easier and faster.

**SAMSUNG WA50M7450AW Washing Machine:** This top-loading washing machine is a great value. It comes equipped with a 5.0-cubic-foot capacity and ten adjustable wash options to satisfy all your needs. It's also Energy Star certified and comes with a low price tag, so it's a great all-around deal.

No matter what budget you have or what your laundry needs are, there's plenty of options for finding the best washing machine for your home. To learn more about our top appliances, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to find the perfect fit for you.
