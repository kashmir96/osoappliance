## Solving the 9c1 Error on a Samsung Dryer
No one likes having to deal with dryer issues, but when you get the 9c1 error code, you need to take quick action. This error code typically means the dryerâ€™s internal temperature has exceeded it's acceptable range. If this happens, your dryer won't work and is a safety hazard. 

In order to solve the 9c1 error code, you need to first find the source of the problem. First, all vents and ducts should be checked thoroughly to ensure they are free of lint, debris, and other items that might be blocking the air flow. Next, check the outside of the dryer vents and making sure the vents are open and not blocked by items like weeds, leaves, or other debris. 

After you have checked all vents, the next step is to find out if the dryer's motor is working correctly. The motor typically powers the blower wheel that blows air from the dryer. If the motor isn't working, it will cause a sharp rise in the temperature of the dryer. Your dryer may need to be serviced if this is the problem.

Finally, you will want to check to make sure your dryer is securely grounded. This should be checked by a qualified technician if necessary.

Once you take the steps outlined above, your dryer should be back in working order. For more information on various error codes, visit our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary and learn the cause and solutions for the issues you may be experiencing.
