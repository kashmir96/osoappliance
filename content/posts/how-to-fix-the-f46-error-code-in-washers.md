## Repairing the 'f46' Error Code in Washers 
Are you experiencing the 'f46' error code from your washer? Don't worry, it's not an error you'll have to live with! Fixed can be fixed. 

The ‘f46’ error code appears when the pressure switch thinks there isn’t enough water in the tub. This is usually caused by a failure of the pressure switch to respond to the water level in the washer and is a relatively easy to diagnose and fix. 

The first step is to take your washer apart and inspect the interior for any clogs. If any clogs are found, clear them and the tub should then work normally. If there are still issues, the pressure switch itself may need to be replaced.

Once the pressure switch is replaced, you should run a quick test on the machine to make sure that the code is gone and the washer is running properly. If the washer fails the test after the pressure switch is replaced, it’s best to call a professional to take a look at the issue.
