## What Does CF E Error On My Fridge Mean?

Are you scratching your head at the error code being shown on your fridge's display? If you're not sure what it means, don't worry! In this blog we'll explain what the CF E error code means and more importantly why this code appears on your fridge.

CF E error codes on a refrigerator display generally indicates a short circuit in the refrigerator's evaporator fan motor. This is a common problem on many modern fridges and can normally be fixed relatively easily. It's important to identify and fix the issue to keep your fridge in peak condition and ensure there are no further issues related to it.

There are a few possible causes for the CF E error on a refrigerator display. First, it could be that the evaporator fan motor isn't functioning properly. Another potential cause is a faulty electronic control board or a power surge. Whatever the cause, it's important to identify and address the issue quickly and appropriately.

It's possible to check the evaporator fan manually - you can use a multi-meter to check the continuity of the motor and see if it's working properly. If the continuity check is good, the issue is likely to be an electronic control board or power surge. If the motor appears to be damaged, it is likely that it needs to be replaced.

## Conclusion

The CF E error code generally indicates a failed evaporator fan motor or other issue with an electronic control board or a power surge. A multi-meter can be used to check the motor's continuity and test if it is working properly. If it appears to be damaged and faulty, then the motor will likely need to be replaced.
