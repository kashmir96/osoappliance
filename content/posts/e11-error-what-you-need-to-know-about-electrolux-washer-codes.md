## Error E11 - Demystifying Electrolux Washer Error Codes

Household appliances, like the Electrolux Washer, are complex machines capable of completing many tasks. Unfortunately, from time to time, these complicated machines may encounter errors that can leave users perplexed and frustrated. One of the most common error codes that may show up on your Electrolux Washer is the dreaded E11 error. If you're experiencing this fault code, this post will help you understand what it means and what you can do to get your appliance working again. 

The E11 code signifies that the washer control board has recognized a sewer pump error. It may also indicate that the pump is blocked in some way. If the machine has been used continually for an extended period of time, this error code may appear due to a lint or dirt buildup in the pump filter. It is not uncommon for the filter to need cleaning after considerable use, and this is generally a straightforward process. If cleaning the filter does not resolve the issue, or if the filter appears undamaged, the pump may need to be replaced. 

The E11 error code can also appear if not enough water is being supplied to the machine. This could be a result of inadequate water pressure or a faulty water inlet valve. To address this situation, first check the water pressure to make sure its not below the recommended level. If it is sufficient, then it may be an issue with the valve. If this is the case, seeking out a qualified repair specialist may be necessary. 

Though it can be a little intimidating to encounter a new error code, the E11 error is generally easy to diagnose and address. Begin by checking the pump filter for any buildup of lint or dirt and cleaning if necessary. If that does not resolve the issue, the water pressure should be inspected and the water inlet valve examined for any signs of damage. If the issue still persists, consulting with a certified repair specialist is advisable.
