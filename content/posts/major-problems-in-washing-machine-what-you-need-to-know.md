## Major Problems in Washing Machines that Need to Be Known 
Are you having trouble with your washing machine? When problems occur it's important to know and understand the major issues that might be causing them. From common issues like not draining properly to technical problems with the motor, this article will look at some of the top issues with washing machines and how they could be resolved.

One of the most common issues is water that doesn't drain properly from the machine. This could be from something as simple as a clogged filter. It could also be from a broken pump, which means it needs to be replaced. Another common issue is not agitating correctly, which can be caused by a worn out drive belt. If the appliance isn't receiving power, then it could be a faulty power cord or blown fuse.

Sometimes the problem can be more complex, such as a faulty motor. The motor needs to be tested to determine if it needs to be repaired or replaced. If you're experiencing any issues with your wash cycle, it could be a problem with the timer or the water inlet valve.

When troubleshooting your washing machine, always take a few measurements first. Check the connections and wiring to ensure everything is connected properly. If the controls are malfunctioning, you may need to replace them or have them serviced. It's best to leave any technical repairs or replacements to a professional to avoid further damage.

With the right troubleshooting, any issues with your washing machine can be resolved. Knowing the major problems that can occur in a washing machine can help you make better decisions when it comes to repairs and replacements.
