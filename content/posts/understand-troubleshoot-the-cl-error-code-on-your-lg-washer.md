## How to Diagnose and Fix the cl Error Code on Your LG Washing Machine
If you have an LG washing machine you may be familiar with the cl error code it displays. Unlike other error codes, this one has no clear resolution as to what is causing the problem. Don’t worry though, as this article will help you troubleshoot the issue and get your LG washer back up and running in no time.

When a cl error code shows up on your washer, it indicates that an error has occurred that is preventing the washer from working properly. The code indicates the problem is related to the water level sensing circuit. This means that either the water level, the pressure switch, or the pump is at fault.

The first step in solving the cl error code problem is to check the water connection. Make sure that the water hose is properly attached and that the water supply is turned on. Next, make sure the water pressure coming in is sufficient for the washer to work properly. If all of these seem ok, move on to checking the water level and pressure switch.

If the water level is too low for the washer to work properly, adjust it to the correct level and that should fix the problem. If this does not solve the cl error code, inspect the pressure switch next. This is located at the back of the washing machine and it should be clean and free of any debris. Clean it off and make sure it’s properly connected to the washer.

Lastly, it’s possible the pump is clogged and not working properly. To resolve this, open the bottom cover of the washer and check the pump. Make sure nothing is blocking the pump, and that it’s rotating freely. If it appears to be clogged with debris or otherwise not working properly, you’ll need to replace the pump.

Troubleshooting the LG washer cl error code is not always straightforward. If you’re still having trouble, consult the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for more in-depth information about diagnosing and fixing washer errors.
