## Evaluating the Cost-Benefit of Repairing a Fridge or Freezer
When a fridge or freezer encounters problems, it can be difficult to decide if you should repair or replace the unit. To help you make the decision, weâ€™ve put together a guide that breaks down the essential questions to ask yourself. 

When you encounter a problem with a fridge or freezer, a good first step is to diagnose the issue by inspecting for any damage, locating the source of the error code, and determining whether the issue is minor or major. Knowing the source of the issue and the type of repairs required can help you to accurately assess how much it will cost to repair the unit and how long the repair may take.

When assessing the cost-benefit of repairing a fridge or freezer, it is important to consider the cost of the repair in relation to the cost of buying a new unit; purchasing a new unit may be more cost-effective and time-efficient than repairing the existing one. In addition, the reparability of the unit should be taken into consideration. If a unit is outdated and cannot be repaired due to the cost or availability of parts, then this could be a sign that it is time to invest in a new unit. 

Before you go ahead and purchase a new fridge or freezer, it is important to assess your financial situation and consider the lifespan of a new unit. If a replacement unit will last longer than a repaired unit and add years of use to your kitchen, it might make sense to make the investment. 

When deciding if it is worth repairing a fridge or freezer, the most important factor is your budget and lifestyle. Always assess the cost-benefit of each option and compare the cost of purchasing a new fridge or freezer with the cost of repairs. 

To help ensure your refrigerator or freezer runs in peak performance, be sure to refer our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](../error-codes/) for information on the most common errors, their causes, and instructions for repair. Our comprehensive Error Codes Glossary will help you to quickly diagnose and repair minor problems, and make informed decisions about major repairs and replacements.
