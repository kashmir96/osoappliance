## Experiencing Air Conditioning Troubles?
Summertime can be incredibly uncomfortable when your air conditioning unit isn't functioning correctly. Many homeowners experience air conditioning troubles and are unsure of what the problem is or how to fix it. Here, we will look at some common air conditioning problems and their solutions so you can troubleshoot any issues quickly. 

One of the most common air conditioning problems is a malfunctioning outdoor unit. If the outdoor unit is not running, then it could be due to a power surge or a mechanical problem. If the unit powers on, check the condenser fan to make sure that it is running. If it isnâ€™t, then it could be due to a faulty motor or a blocked airflow which can be caused by debris or dirt build up around the fan blades. To fix this problem, you will need to clean the fan blades, remove objects from the unit, and make sure that it is getting enough power. 

Another common problem is leaking coolant. This is usually caused by a faulty air conditioner seal which can over time become worn or stretched. In this situation, you will need to replace the seal to prevent coolant from corroding the fan blades and causing damage to the unit. 

Finally, if you notice any strange noises coming from your air conditioner, then it likely means that something is loose or not working properly. This could be due to worn or broken fan blades, a faulty motor, or a loose connection. To resolve this issue, you will need to replace any broken parts and ensure that the connections are secure. 

By being aware of the common air conditioning problems and knowing how to fix them, you can quickly troubleshoot any issues and keep your air conditioning unit running smoothly. If your air conditioning system is still malfunctioning or you are not confident in your abilities to repair it, then it is recommended that you seek help from a [professional appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to get your unit back in working order.

## Common Air Conditioning Problems
Are you having troubles with your air conditioning? Here are some common problems that can occur and their resolutions.

**1. My air conditioner isn't turning on.**

This could be due to several factors such as a blown fuse, tripped circuit breaker, defective thermostat, or an issue with the compressor or fan. First, check for any tripped breakers or blown fuses. If these have been replaced and the problem still persists, it is recommended to call a professional HVAC technician to diagnose the issue. 

**2. My air conditioner is making strange noises.**

It is normal for an air conditioner to make noise when it is running, however, loud or strange noises could indicate an issue with the fan or compressor. If you notice these types of noises, shut off the air conditioner, and contact a professional HVAC technician to diagnose the problem. 

**3. My air conditioner isn't cooling my home.**

Again, this could be due to several factors. One quick and easy fix you can try is check your air filters. If the air filter is too clogged, it can prevent adequate air flow and proper cooling. Ensure that all vents are open and clear of debris, and that air flow isn't being blocked in any way. If the problem persists, call a professional HVAC technician to diagnose the issue. 

**4. My thermostat is inaccurate.*

A faulty thermostat can result in inaccurate readings. For starters, check the thermostat's battery, as a low battery can cause irregularities. If the battery has been replaced and the problem still persists, it is recommended to call a professional HVAC technician to assess and diagnose the issue. 

**5. My air conditioner is leaking water.**

Leaking water is usually indicative of a clogged condensate drain line. First, check the pan around the hose to ensure that nothing is blocking the drain. If the pan is clear, the issue is most likely a clogged condensate line. This issue should be addressed by a professional HVAC technician.

## Key Takeaways:
1. **Power issues** can cause the outdoor AC unit to not run - these can be due to power surges or mechanical problems - check the condenser fan and clean the fan blades to ensure there is clear airflow.
2. **Leaking coolant** could be caused by a faulty seal - replace the seal to prevent coolant from damaging the unit.
3. Strange **noises** could be due to worn or broken fan blades, a faulty motor, or a loose connection - replace any broken parts and ensure the connections are secure.
4. Being aware of common problems and knowing how to **fix them** can help quickly troubleshoot any AC issues.
5. If you're not confident in repairs, it's best to seek help from a **professional appliance repair technician**.
