With all the advancements in technology, this may not be as far fetched as you think. With an AC Remote Control App, you can now control your Android device with just the press of a button.

This type of app is ideal for those that want complete control over their Android device, no matter where they are in the home. It allows you to set up and personalize settings, allowing you to customize your device to meet all your needs. Whether you're streaming your favorite show, or checking in on the news, you'll be able to do all these tasks from the comfort of your couch with an AC remote control app.

Another great feature you'll find with remote control apps are infrared capabilities. You'll have the ability to control your device without even having to be in the same room. You'll have total control over your device, even when you aren't home. You can set up your device to respond to commands from the app, and it will react as though you pressed the button yourself. Functions such as playback, volume, and seeking are just a few of the tasks that can be automated using infrared technology.
