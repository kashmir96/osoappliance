## How Long Do Laundromats Take: A Guide to Laundry Timing

Doing laundry can often be a time-consuming chore, but knowing how long your laundry should take in a laundromat can help you plan your day better. Here is a guide to the timing of each step of the laundry process at a laundromat. 

**Wash Cycle** – Washing clothes in washing machines typically takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour depending on the type of washer and size of the load you are washing. 

**Rinse Cycle** – The rinse cycle usually takes around 15 minutes per load, with larger loads taking slightly longer. 

**Dry Cycle – **Tumble dryers usually take around 45 minutes for large loads and up to an hour for extra-large loads. Delicates may need less time and regular fabrics more time. 
 
The overall time for doing laundry in a laundromat varies depending on how many items you’re washing, the type of washer and dryer used, and whether or not you already pre-treated any stains before laundering your items. In general, it would be safe to assume that doing one load of laundry at a laundromat will take about two hours from start to finish if all machines are working properly.
