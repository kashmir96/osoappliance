If your dishwasher runs and your sink starts to fill up with water, you may have a problem with your dishwasher drainage system. Dishwashers are designed to drain the dirty water they use away from the sink and into the sewer line. If something is preventing the water from draining properly, it can back up into the sink.

The most common cause of this problem is a clogged drain hose or air gap. The drain hose is a flexible tube that connects the dishwasher to the garbage disposal or drain pipe under your sink. Over time this hose can become clogged with food particles or other debris, blocking water flow and causing it to back up into the sink instead of draining properly. An air gap is an anti-siphon device that prevents contaminated dishwasher water from entering into drinking water lines if there’s ever a break in the dishwasher’s drainage system. A clog in this device can also cause water to back up into your sink.

If you think a clog in either of these components is causing your dishwasher drainage issue, you’ll need to inspect them for blockages and remove any debris you find using a wet/dry vacuum or plunger. If that doesn’t solve the problem, try running some vinegar through your dishwasher on its hottest setting as this may help dissolve any built-up grease or soap scum that could be causing problems further down in the drainage system. If none of these solutions work, then it may be time to call in a professional plumber for assistance.
