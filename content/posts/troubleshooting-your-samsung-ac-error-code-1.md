## Troubleshooting Samsung AC Error Code 1

This blog will provide information on how to troubleshoot Error Code 1 that may appear on your Samsung AC. Error Code 1 indicates that your AC unit has a problem with its compressor and has gone into high pressure protection mode.

First, you must turn off the unit and unplug it. Wait 10 minutes before plugging it back in and turning the air conditioner back on. During this time, it is wise to check the air filter to make sure it isn't blocked. If the filter is dirty, you should remove it and wash it off before reinserting it.

You should also thoroughly inspect the condenser and evaporator coils. If either is damaged or blocked, it is likely causing the pressure to rise in the system, thus triggering Error Code 1. Cleaning the coils can reduce pressure in the system and may help resolve your issue.

If the issue persists, you should check the compressor itself. The most common causes of a malfunctioning compressor are a bad electrical connection, a contaminated compressor oil, or faulty capacitors. You should make sure all connections are clean and secure, and also check the compressor oil.

Once all these steps have been taken, you should restart your air conditioner and wait to see if your AC error code 1 appears again. If it does, you should seek professional support to repair the issue.

By following the steps above, you can troubleshoot Error Code 1 on your Samsung AC unit. If you find you need further assistance, be sure to check our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to explore more useful information and advice.
