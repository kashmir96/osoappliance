## Safety Considerations When Using a Hair Dryer

It may surprise you to know that, despite the fact that hair dryers are so often taken for granted, they can pose a risk to your safety if they're not used properly. In order to keep your hair, and yourself, safe, there are a few things you should know about the risks of using a hair dryer.

Using a hair dryer that is too old or improperly taken care of can lead to an electrical fire, which can cause serious injury or damage. Therefore, it is important to inspect your hair dryer carefully for any visible signs of damage, such as frayed cords, cracked cords, or faulty switches. It is also important to replace your dryer every two to three years to ensure that it is operating correctly and safely. In addition, if you notice any sparks or smoke coming from your dryer, stop using it immediately and replace it as soon as possible.

Hair dryers can also pose a burn risk when used improperly. Burns can occur if the dryer is too close to the hair for too long or if excessive heat is used. To avoid this risk, it is important to choose a dryer that has different heat levels that you can adjust to suit your needs, as well as a cool setting. You should also use a heat protectant when styling your hair.

Finally, hair dryers can also cause damage to your hair if they are used too often. Over-drying the hair can cause it to become dry and brittle, leading to split ends and breakage. In addition, using a dryer that generates too much heat can cause the cuticles of the hair to become damaged, resulting in dryness and frizz. In order to prevent this, it is best to keep the dryer at a distance of at least 6 inches from the hair and use a heat protectant every time you style.

Knowing the risks associated with using a hair dryer is essential to keeping your hair and yourself safe. When used correctly, hair dryers can be a great tool to create the look you desire.
