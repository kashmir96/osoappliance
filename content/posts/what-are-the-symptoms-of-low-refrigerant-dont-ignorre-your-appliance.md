## Low Refrigerant Symptoms Can't be Ignored
Refrigerators have been keeping food items fresh in homes and businesses across the world for decades, and now more and more people are aware of environmental regulations that limit the usage of refrigerants in order to lower emissions and better maintain the ozone layer. While this is great news for the planet, it also means that homeowners should be aware of the signs that indicate their refrigerator is losing refrigerant, which will require a professional repair in order to keep the appliance running.

One common symptom of a refrigerator with low refrigerant is increased noise level. If a refrigerator is producing more noise than usual, it could mean that the compressor needs to work harder due to the lack of refrigerant, leading to greater noise and higher energy costs.

Homeowners can also keep an eye for overheating. A refrigerator with low refrigerant will work harder than normal, potentially causing it to run hotter than usual and reducing its efficiency. This can also lead to an increased chance of fire.

Finally, another sign of low refrigerant may come in the form of poor cooling. If food isn’t staying as cold as it should, the refrigerator may be losing its refrigerant, leading to more frequent cycles and less-than-ideal cooling.

If homeowners notice any of these symptoms, they should consider contacting a professional refrigerator repair service as soon as possible in order to address the low refrigerant issue. It’s also worth checking out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to get a better idea of which parts may need to be replaced. Ignoring the signs of low refrigerant can lead to bigger problems, so homeowners need to be proactive in keeping their refrigerators in tip-top shape.
