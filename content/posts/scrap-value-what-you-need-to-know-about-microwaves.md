## Understanding Scrap Value for Microwaves 

Do you have an old microwave that's stopped functioning? You might be wondering what you should do with it, whether you can get rid of it for free, and what it’s worth. Understanding scrap value for microwaves can help you decide the best course of action. 

At its most basic level, the scrap value of something is the salvage value or resale value of it. Something can have a scrap value even if it’s not working, however, it may not have any marketable parts. That’s why it’s important to understand the condition and components of your old microwave, because it will impact what you can get for it.

When it comes to microwaves, the scrap value will vary depending on the type and age. If you have an older model, the scrap value often is determined based on the weight of the metal, usually copper and aluminum. If you have a newer, digital model, the scrap value can be based on parts and components that can be recycled or resold. 

Even if a microwave isn’t working and is considered to be scrap material, you may be able to get a few bucks for it by taking it to a scrap yard. Some scrap yards and electronic recycling centers also accept microwaves for free with a valid ID. 

You also can post an ad online for free, hoping to find someone interested in salvaging the parts for a working microwave. Of course, you can also always take out an ad in your local paper. 

Ultimately, the scrap value of your microwave is decided by the scrap yard or recycling center. The amount of money you can get for it will depend on the condition and age, as well as the current market price for metals.
