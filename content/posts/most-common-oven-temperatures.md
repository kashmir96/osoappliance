The oven is one of the most commonly used appliances in the kitchen. It can be used for baking, roasting, toasting, and even broiling foods. Depending on the type of oven you have, you may have a variety of settings and options to choose from. To help you understand which setting to use when cooking different types of meals, here is an overview of the most common oven settings:

Bake: This setting is typically used for cakes, cookies and other baked goods that require uniform heating. The heat circulates evenly throughout the oven so that food cooks evenly without having to turn it over halfway through baking time. The temperature range can be anywhere from 300°F (150°C) up to 500°F (260°C). 

Broil/Grill: This setting uses direct heat from an element or burner at the top of your oven in order to brown or crisp foods quickly on top while still cooking them through inside. Broiling typically takes place at temperatures ranging from 450-500°F (232-260°C). 

Convection Bake/Roast: This setting uses forced hot air circulation throughout your oven for faster and more even cooking results compared to traditional baking methods. The temperature range typically goes up to 425-450°F (218-232°C). 

Proof: This setting is designed for breads or doughs that need a warm environment in order to rise properly before baking off in the oven. It usually runs at around 100-125°F (38–52 °C). 

Self Cleaning Setting: As its name implies, this feature helps clean your oven by burning off stuck-on food residue with high temperatures ranging between 600–800 °F (316–427 °C). It usually takes around three hours before it’s finished running its cycle so make sure not leave anything important inside while it’s running! 

Now that you know what each commonsetting does, you can get started using youroven with confidence! Just rememberto always read your manual first asdifferent brands may vary slightly intheir settings and features offered ontheir appliance models
