## Tips to Achieve Perfectly Cooked Rice Using a Rice Cooker

Tired of inedible, dry, crunchy, or overcooked rice? Fear not, with a few simple tips, you can guarantee perfectly cooked rice every time with your trusty rice cooker! Making sure that you prepare the ingredients correctly and use your rice cooker correctly will result in delicious, perfectly cooked rice. Follow the guidance provided in this article to save time, energy and frustration spent on cooking rice. 

When it comes to preparing your rice and setting the rice cooker, you have a few options. For jasmine, basmati, and parboiled rice, measure your rice by volume. Make sure to use a 1:1.5 parts water-to-rice ratio. Turn on your rice cooker, add the rice and water, stir and then close the lid. When the indicators signal that the cooking process is complete, wait until all the moisture is absorbed and then fluff up the rice with a fork.

If you‘re cooking long grain and brown rice, use the same 1:2 parts water-to-rice ratio. With these types of rice, you’ll want to give the surfaces of the rice cooker a quick rinse with distilled water beforehand. This step is particularly important, as long grain and brown rice often has a lot of excess starch on its surface. Keep an eye on the cooking time, because this type of rice needs a bit more cooking time in order to reach full fluffiness.

Finally, for wild and short grain rice, you’ll need to use a 1:2.5 water-to-rice ratio, as well as a five minute presoak before starting the cooking process. After adding the water and presoaked rice, make sure to let the rice soak in the cooker for an additional five minutes before starting the cooking process. The soaking process will facilitate more even cooking.

Rice cookers are the perfect tool to get your rice perfectly cooked every time. If you have any questions about the process, don’t hesitate to find a [certified repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) who can offer additional help and advice. Now you can feel confident that you will create delicious, perfectly cooked rice with each use of your trusty rice cooker.

## Troubleshooting Your Way to Perfectly Cooked Rice

##### What are the different settings on a rice cooker?
Most rice cookers have settings for white and brown rice, a setting for settings for white and brown rice, a setting for ‘quick cook’, a setting for ‘keep warm’, and often times settings for soup/stew, cake, and even yogurt.

##### How can I tell when the rice is done cooking?
Your rice cooker will usually beep to notify you when the cooking cycle is complete. Additionally, you can typically tell when the rice is done if you open the lid and it looks fluffy, flavored with water or broth, and still quite moist.

##### What is the difference between white and brown rice?
White rice is not as nutritionally dense as brown, as it has been processed to remove all of its protective outer layers. Brown rice, in comparison, is minimally processed and still contains its nutrient-rich outer shells.

##### How much water do I need to add?
The general rule is that you should always add one to one-and-a-half times the amount of water to the amount of uncooked rice. For example, if you’re cooking one cup of uncooked rice, you’ll need to add anywhere from one to one-and-a-half cups of water.

##### How long does it take to cook rice in a rice cooker?
It depends on what type of rice you’re cooking and what settings you’re using. Generally speaking, it usually takes about 15-20 minutes for white rice and 20-25 minutes for brown rice. The ‘quick cook’ setting typically only takes 5-10 minutes.
