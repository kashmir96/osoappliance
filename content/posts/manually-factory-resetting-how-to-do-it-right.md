## Properly Factory Resetting Household Devices 

If you’re having trouble with your household device’s normal functionality, a factory reset is the quickest way to get it back to its optimal settings. However, manually factory resetting your device can be tricky and potentially cause damage. Keep reading to learn more about a few basic tips and tricks related to factory resetting your device safely and correctly.

When you decide that a factory reset is necessary, the first step is to back up your data. Make sure to save any files, folders or settings that you don't want to lose, because a factory reset will remove them. After backing up your important data, the process of resetting the device will vary depending on the device’s operating system. 

In technology, the phrase “hard reset” is often used to indicate that one is trying to restore the device to its factory settings. Depending on the type of device being reset, a hard reset may involve physically press and hold certain buttons, enter an activation code in the settings menu, or restore the device to its default settings on the menu. 

Once you’ve followed the steps to reset the device, the device will reboot and you will be able to use it as if it were new, with all of the pre-installed settings and applications.

Factory resetting your device is a great way to reset the device back to its original, optimal performance settings. However, it’s important to remember that this reset also erases all personal data, settings and applications. That’s why it’s important to be sure to back up your data before resetting the device.

Manually factory resetting your household device doesn’t have to be difficult. Research your device’s steps and settings to ensure that the reset is done correctly and efficiently. However, if you find yourself with an unresolved issue or a perplexing error code, consult our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for clarification.
