If you are looking for the best microwave of 2023, you have come to the right place. With so many models on the market, it can be overwhelming trying to figure out which one is right for your kitchen. It is important to take into account several factors when choosing a new microwave, such as size, power, features and price. 

The first thing to consider when buying a microwave is size. Depending on your kitchen layout and available counter space, you will need to choose a model that fits in with your existing appliances and fits in your allotted space. If you are limited on counter space or want something more compact, then a small or mid-sized model should do the trick. Larger microwaves typically offer more features and power but may take up too much room if counter space is at a premium in your kitchen. 

Power is another important factor when shopping for microwaves. The higher the wattage of the unit, the faster and more powerful it will be when heating food quickly and evenly. Most microwaves range from 500–1800 watts with some models going up to 2500 watts or higher. In general, larger microwaves tend to have higher wattages than smaller models so it’s worth taking that into consideration if you need quick cooking times for large meals or frozen foods. 

Features are also an important factor when selecting a new microwave oven as there can be quite a lot of variation between different brands and models on offer these days. Basic microwaves may only feature basic reheating functions while mid-range models could include additional settings such as defrosting options or grilling capabilities alongside their standard reheating functions . High end models usually offer convection cooking along with other advanced settings such as multi-stage cooking programs which allow users to program temperatures and times for specific dishes making them ideal for busy households who require convenience without compromising on quality results 

Finally price should also be taken into consideration when purchasing any kind of appliance including microwaves . Prices can range from budget friendly entry level units up to high end designer units costing upwards of $500 . Decide what features are most important for your needs then research online compare prices from different retailers before making any final decisions . This way you can make sure that get get value for money whilst still getting all of the features required by your household . 

 All things considered , there’s no single ‘best’ microwave – what works best will depend largely on individual preferences , kitchen layout and available budget . However by taking all these factors into consideration before making any purchase , customers should be able find an appliance that meets their needs perfectly while still offering excellent value for money !
