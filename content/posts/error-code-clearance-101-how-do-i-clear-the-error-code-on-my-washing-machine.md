## An Essential Guide for Household Appliance Users
If you own a washing machine, you'll likely encounter an error code once in a while. Errors in your washing machine don't mean an end to your laundry needs but instead require some simple steps to clear the fault and get you back to keeping clothes clean. Keep reading to learn the essentials of Error Code Clearing 101 and have a better understanding of how to troubleshoot errors and get your washing machine up and running again.

Understanding why your machine is displaying an error code is the first step. Generally, each error code corresponds to a specific issue. For instance, E1 indicates a problematic water supply that is preventing the machine from starting correctly. On the other hand, E5 is an indication of a water temperature issue. 

If the error code is an E1, it could be a problem with the water supply or a faulty inlet hose. You’ll need to investigate and ascertain which it is and fix the issue before starting the washing machine anew. Similarly, if the error code is an E5, you may need to adjust the temperature of the water being supplied to the machine or you could look for any possible blockages in the waterways.

While trying to troubleshoot based on the error code, owners should also make sure the machine is not overloaded, as this could lead to similar fault codes. It’s also important to inspect the machine’s detergent and fabric softener compartments from time to time and clear away any debris build-up.
