The broil setting on your oven is a great way to get that golden, crispy finish on your food. Broiling is a method of cooking that uses direct heat to quickly cook food. The heat source comes from the top of the oven, rather than the bottom like when baking. This method of cooking is ideal for quickly searing or browning the surface of food while keeping the inside juicy and tender. 

When using the broil setting, it’s important to keep an eye on your food as it cooks. Foods can go from perfectly cooked to charred in a matter of minutes under high heat. To ensure your food cooks evenly and doesn’t burn, use a shallow baking dish or sheet pan and place it on the top rack of the oven. This will help keep the heat from being too intense on one side of your dish. 

When you turn on the broil setting, preheat your oven for about 10 minutes before adding your dish. This will help ensure that all parts of your dish are exposed to equal amounts of heat. Depending on what you’re cooking, you may need to move it around throughout the cooking process so that all sides get cooked evenly. 

Broiling is a great way to quickly cook meats and vegetables while keeping them moist and flavorful. It’s also a great way to give foods like fish or steak a nice crispy crust without overcooking them. So next time you’re in need of a quick meal, try using your oven’s broil setting!
