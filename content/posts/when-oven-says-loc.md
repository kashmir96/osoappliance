When your oven displays the message "LOC" it means that the oven's control lock feature has been activated. This feature is designed to prevent accidental changes to the oven settings, such as turning on the self-cleaning cycle, or changing the temperature setting.

To unlock your oven, press and hold down the Clear/Off button for three seconds. This should cause the "LOC" message to disappear from your display and allow you to make changes to your oven settings again. If this does not work, consult your owner's manual for additional instructions specific to your model of oven. 

If you find that you are frequently needing to unlock your oven, you may want to consider disabling the control lock feature altogether. This can usually be done by pressing and holding down two buttons simultaneously until a message appears on screen indicating that the control lock has been disabled. Again, consult your owner's manual if you are unsure how this is done with your particular model of oven. 

It is important to note that while disabling this feature may make it easier for you to adjust settings as needed, it could also lead to accidental changes if something were accidentally bumped or pressed while cooking or cleaning up in the kitchen area near your stovetop or range. Consider carefully whether this is an option that works best for you and keep in mind that it can always be re-enabled again at any time in case of an emergency situation where someone needs quick access to make changes without any delay due to a locked control panel display.
