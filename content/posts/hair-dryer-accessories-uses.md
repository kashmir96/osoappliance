Hair dryers are an essential tool for creating a variety of hairstyles, from smooth and straight to voluminous curls. But the basic hair dryer itself can only do so much. Thankfully, there are plenty of accessories that can help you take your style to the next level. Here’s a look at some of the most useful hair dryer accessories and how they can help you achieve the perfect 'do.

The first accessory every hairstylist needs is a diffuser. Diffusers are used to evenly distribute heat and airflow while drying hair, resulting in bouncier curls or less frizz with straight styles. They also allow you to focus heat on specific sections of your hair, which means more precise styling results than with just the dryer alone.

Heat protectant sprays are also essential for protecting strands from damage caused by hot tools like hair dryers and curling irons. Heat protectants work by creating a barrier between your strands and intense heat; this helps retain moisture in your hair as it dries, leaving it soft and shiny instead of over-dried or brittle looking. Always spray on sections of damp (not wet) hair prior to drying for best results.

For those looking for extra lift at the roots when styling their locks, consider investing in a round brush or boar bristle brush set. Round brushes range from small to large sizes depending on desired style outcomes; smaller brushes give more curl while larger ones provide extra lift at the roots for that voluminous finish everyone covets! Boar bristle brushes also work well for adding texture as they distribute natural oils throughout strands as you blow-dry them—leaving your mane healthy looking in addition to being freshly styled!

Finally, if you’re looking to speed up styling time (who isn’t?), try investing in salon grade attachments like concentrators or nozzle attachments designed specifically for certain hairstyles/hair types or even different temperature settings—saving you time as well as money spent on costly trips to the salon! 

No matter what kind of style you’re aiming for, there is an accessory out there that will make achieving it easier than ever before with just your hairdryer alone! Investing in these useful tools will pay off big time when it comes time to makeover your ‘do - whether it be day-to-day maintenance or something more special occasion worthy!
