## Spotting the Safety Hazards of Water Coolers

Water coolers are a convenient and common household appliance that offer quick, cold drinking water for your family and their friends! They are so popular that most public places, such as offices, schools, and gyms, also have them installed. These coolers can be a great addition to any home, and although they are pretty straightforward in use, there could be potential risks involved.

As with all household appliances, there are certain precautions you should take to ensure your water cooler provides safe, clean drinking water. The risk posed by a water cooler lies in contaminants, viruses, and bacteria which may be in the water, so it's important to keep your appliance maintained.

You should start by checking the water your cooler uses regularly for any contaminants. If you notice signs of wear and tear, it's a good idea to replace certain parts of the cooler. For example, you should replace the water filter which is responsible for keeping the water free from impurities. Also, you should regularly clean the cooler's bowl and water reservoir to ensure no microbial growth or contamination.

It's also important to use the correct water line adapters to avoid contamination from unclean water. Lastly, you should avoid using flavored water in your water cooler, as those liquids can corrode the appliance and lead to serious health risks.

## Dangers of Water Coolers

1. What are the potential dangers posed by water coolers?
 Water coolers can act as a breeding ground for bacteria when the water is not cleaned or changed regularly. Similarly, water coolers can become a source of Legionella bacteria when the reservoir is not disinfected or replaced. Water coolers can also develop mould growth inside the reservoir which can prove hazardous to health, especially to people with respiratory issues.

2. How can I check my water cooler for potential hazards?
 If you have a water cooler installed at home or in the workplace, it is important to inspect it regularly. Start by checking that there is no mould growth inside, and visually inspect around the edges and underneath the dispenser. If the water inside is unusually cloudy or has an unpleasant smell, it should be replaced immediately.

3. What should be done to keep a water cooler safe?
 To ensure that your water cooler is safe and free from potential hazards, it is important to clean and disinfect it regularly. The reservoir should be disinfected at least once a month using a dilute solution of bleach and warm water, and emptied and replaced with fresh water every three months or more often if required.

4. What signs should I look out for to know if I need to replace my water cooler?
 The signs that you may need to replace your water cooler include leakage or breaks in the plumbing, rusting or signs of corrosion in the reservoir and visible signs of mould or mildew. Also, if the water tastes strange or the water temperature is not consistent, you may need to look at replacing the water cooler.

5. What safety measures should I take before using a water cooler?
 Before using a water cooler, you should always consult manufacturerâ€™s instructions and use appropriate safety measures. Be sure to clean and disinfect the dispenser and reservoir regularly and replace the water inside with fresh water every three months. Check for any signs of rust, corrosion or leaks, and replace the water cooler if necessary.
