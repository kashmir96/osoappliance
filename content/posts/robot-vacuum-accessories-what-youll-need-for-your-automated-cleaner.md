## Outfit Your Robot Vacuum for Effortless Cleaning 

Gone are the days of having to slave away with your old-fashioned vacuum cleaner. Now, robot vacuums can do the cleaning for you--with no physical effort on your part. But, to make the most of this effortless cleaning tool, you'll need to make sure you have the right robot vacuum accessories. 

The starting point is to identify your specific model; this will let you know what accessories are available and which ones you need. When choosing accessories, it's important to make sure they are compatible with your vacuuming robot which allows you to personalize your purchases and match tools that suit your cleaning needs.

If you want to increase the area that your robot vacuums can cover, you may want to invest in a docking station to connect multiple vacuums together. Another helpful tool is a remote control, to help you steer the vacuuming robot from afar. If the area to clean is large, you may also want to get a Virtual Wall that helps prevent the robot from going where you don't want it to. 

Additional features such as HEPA filters, attached mopping cloths, and one-button opening can also make the daily vacuuming experience more convenient. If you're looking for extra functionalities, many models come with specially designed accessories to help your robot vacuum do even more.
