A dryer washer is a combination appliance that combines a washing machine and a clothes dryer into one unit. It is designed to save space and energy, as well as time and money. With a dryer washer, you can wash and dry your clothes in one cycle and in one machine. This is a great convenience for busy households, as it eliminates the need for a separate washing machine and dryer.

The dryer washer works by first washing the clothes in a washing machine. After the clothes have been washed, they are transferred to the dryer portion of the machine. Here, the clothes are dried using a combination of hot air and tumbling action. This helps to remove moisture from the clothes and make them ready to be worn.

The dryer washer is a great way to save time and money, as well as energy. It eliminates the need for two separate appliances, and it also helps to reduce the amount of energy used in the laundry process. With a dryer washer, you can save time and money, while still ensuring that your clothes are clean and dry.
