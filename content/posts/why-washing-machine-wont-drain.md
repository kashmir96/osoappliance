If your washing machine isn't draining properly, it can be a major inconvenience and a real headache. Fortunately, there are several potential causes for this problem and many of them can be fixed easily without having to call in an appliance repair service. 

One of the most common reasons why your washing machine won't drain is that the pump filter has become clogged. The pump filter is responsible for removing any debris from the water before it is drained away and if it becomes blocked you will experience problems with drainage. To check if this is the issue, open up the front panel of your washer and locate the pump filter. If you see any objects blocking it, remove them and then try running another cycle to see if this has solved the issue. 

Another cause could be a kinked or blocked drain hose which can prevent water from draining away correctly. Check that your drain hose isn’t bent or kinked as this could prevent water from flowing freely through it. You should also perform a visual inspection to make sure there aren’t any blockages in either end of the hose which could be preventing drainage from occurring correctly. If everything appears fine but you are still experiencing problems with drainage, then it might be time to call in an appliance repair service professional on our directory for assistance 

If these two checks fail to solve your problem and you still believe that something more serious is causing your washing machine not to drain properly, then please do get in touch with one of our trusted appliance repair services as soon as possible for more help.
