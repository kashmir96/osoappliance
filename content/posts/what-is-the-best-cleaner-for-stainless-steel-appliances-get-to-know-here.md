## Cleaners to Keep Stainless Steel Appliances Sparkling 

Stainless steel appliances are attractive and durable, but they require regular cleaning to keep them shining. With the right cleaner and methods, you can maintain the pristine look of your refrigerator, stove, and other stainless steel surfaces. In this blog, we'll cover the features and benefits of the best cleaners to use on your stainless steel appliances. 

When you're shopping for a stainless steel cleaner, you want something that won't scratch or damage the protective finish. Caring for stainless steel also requires avoiding products with caustic ingredients like chlorine bleach and high concentrations of ammonia. The safest and most effective choice is a specialist stainless steel cleaner. Many brands offer mild yet effective cleaning solutions designed specifically to remove fingerprints, grease, and other dirt from stainless steel surfaces. 

Another option for keeping your appliances clean is to use a degreaser. Look for a natural and non-toxic degreaser that is safe for use in the kitchen. Natural degreasers, such as those made from plants, may require more elbow grease but are a great way to keep your surfaces clean without adding harsh chemicals to your kitchen environment. 

If you're short on time, you might want to consider a stainless steel polish. A good polish product won't just be cleaning, it'll help to restore the look and luster of the appliance surface, while providing a protective coating that resists fingerprints and dust. 

No matter which product you choose, be sure to apply it as directed on the label. Then use a soft cloth to wipe away the product—a microfiber cloth will ensure that you won't streak or scratch the surface. To get the best results, you may need to rinse the cleaner residue off with plain water after cleaning. 

Once you’re done, your stainless steel appliances should sparkle. A few minutes of regular care will keep your appliances looking brand-new and maintain their value. To learn more about the best appliances on the market, check out our Overview of Top Appliances page.
