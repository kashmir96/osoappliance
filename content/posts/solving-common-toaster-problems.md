## Troubleshooting Common Issues With Your Toaster

Toasters are one of the most iconic kitchen gadgets, and one of the most used. This makes it all the more frustrating when it doesn't seem to be working properly. Thankfully, while you may think it needs to be replaced, there are often simple fixes that might be able to get your toaster working again. Read on to learn some of the most common problem and ways to address them.

### Bulky Items Jamming the Slots

One of the most irritating problems with toasters is when bulky items such as thick pieces of bread become stuck in the toaster slots. To free the item and avoid damaging your toaster, unplug it, turn it upside-down, and shake it gently. This often causes the item to dislodge, and you can continue toasting normally.

### The Toaster Burning the Toasted Goods

Another all too common problem is when bread or other items are coming out of the toaster either too lightly or too dark. Depending on the cause of the issue, this can usually be solved by adjusting the toaster dials. On most toasters, there are two switches that toggle the darkness of the toasted goods, one for each side of the toaster.

### Persistent Smoke

If you are noticing a smoky smell coming from your toaster, the issue is likely due to crumbs at the bottom of the toaster. To prevent a fire hazard and potential smoke damage, unplug the toaster and empty the crumb tray. Turn the toaster upside-down, hold the plug-side towards you, and shake it until all of the crumbs have come out.

### Simple Maintenance Tips

Finally, in order to prevent any future issues with your toaster, it's important to take the time for simple maintenance. Regularly unplug, clean the outside of the appliance, and empty the crumb tray to ensure it's running smoothly. Additionally, replace other worn parts as needed, such as a worn power cord, knobs, and hinges.
