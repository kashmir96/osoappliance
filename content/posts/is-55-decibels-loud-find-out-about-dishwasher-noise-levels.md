## Is 55 Decibels Too Loud For A Dishwasher?

If you recently purchased a dishwasher and your appliance technician told you it would produce noise at 55 decibels, you may be wondering whether that is too loud. Decibels measure the sound intensity level of an appliance, a 55 decibel dishwasher is similar in sound to an air conditioner running in a small room.

When it comes to dishwashers, the standard range is between 35 and 65 decibels, but the loudest dishwashers can hit up to 70 decibels. Dishwashers with noise levels around 55 decibels are considered to be fairly standard. Generally, front loading machines are louder than top loading ones, but all dishwashers produce some level of sound when running.

In terms of how loud 55 decibels is, it can be difficult to give a definite answer. After all, sound is subjective. However, it’s likely to be more than quiet enough for most people who want to run a dishwasher without causing disruption. If you need a quieter option, there are models with noise ratings as low as 35 decibels so you can still enjoy the convenience of having a dishwasher without the sound.

To ensure your dishwasher is running as efficiently and quietly as possible, it's important to keep it well maintained. Ensure your dishwasher is clean and that you regularly check the door gasket to make sure it's in good condition. If there is an issue with your dishwasher, it's a good idea to get a professional and experienced technician to take a look.

When it comes to dishwasher noise levels, 55 decibels can be considered standard. However, if you want something quieter, you should look for a model with a lower noise rating. For any problems with dishwashers and all household appliances, it’s best to consult with a professional appliance repair technician.
