## Overcoming Hurdles with Home Samsung Washing Machines

Getting your laundry done quickly and efficiently can be a hassle. Malfunctions with your washing machine can make it even more difficult. If you’re having difficulty getting your Samsung washing machine to work properly, the tips in this article can help you troubleshoot the problem.

Unresponsive Buttons. Buttons on your washing machine panel can become unresponsive to your finger pushing them. If you can’t get the buttons to work, the problem may be a loose wiring harness connection. You can try to tighten the connection or, if that doesn’t solve the issue, a broken wire may need to be replaced.

Unstable Drum. Samsung washers can have issues with the inner drum being unbalanced. This can be noticeable when the drum is shaking during operation. To fix this, you can rearrange the items in the drum more evenly or check for overloaded capacity. Your washer’s manual should provide guidance on proper loading of the washer.

Leaky Washer. If you notice water collecting around your washer’s base, it could be caused by a damaged or worn door seal. You can inspect the seal yourself by removing the outer lip of the seal with a flat head screwdriver, but replacing a damaged door seal may need professional help.

The problems experienced with Samsung washing machines can be overcome with the right knowledge or professional help. A step-by-step guide to fixing the most common problems can be a good place to start, and if the issue is more complex or needs a parts replacement, you could consider enlisting the help of a qualified appliance repair technician from our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
