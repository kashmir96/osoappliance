## Understanding Error Codes on Your Washing Machine and How to Clear Them
Error codes on washing machines can be a nuisance, but they don't have to be. Understanding the codes and how to clear them is the key to being able to identify and solve the problem without needing to call for service. Here is a guide for clearing error codes on your washing machine quickly and easily.

If you are receiving an error code on your washing machine there are two easy steps to take when trying to identify and clear the code. The first is to locate your washing machine’s manual or user instructions. Most model-specific instructions include a section that explains how to read and clear the error code. If you cannot find the manual or instructions, most of the manufacturers provide this information online as well.

Once you have found the information, you will need to identify the code you are receiving. Depending on the type of washing machine, the error codes can vary. However, generally, flashing lights differ from beeping sounds. Once you have identified the code, the manual should indicate what the code means and the steps to take to fix the problem. Following the manual’s instructions should allow you to clear the code. If you continue to have difficulty, you may need to contact the manufacturer for additional help.

Keeping your washing machine in good condition may help keep it from displaying error codes. When performing regular maintenance, use a soft cloth and mild detergent to clean the exterior of the machine. Also, you should check the following components and keep them free from lint, dirt and hair; the seals, hoses, pump filter, and detergent drawer.

Clearing error codes on your washing machine doesn't need to be stressful. By following the steps above, you can quickly and easily identify and clear the codes. When in doubt, refer to the manufacturer's manual or contact their service department.
