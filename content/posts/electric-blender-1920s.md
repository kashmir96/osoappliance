In the 1920s, electric blenders appeared on the market and changed how people prepared food. Before this time, some households had hand-cranked blenders that required a lot of manual effort and time to use. With an electric blender, all you had to do was plug it in and turn it on for quick blending action.

Electric blenders allowed for more consistent blending results than hand-cranked ones could achieve. This was due to their consistent power output as opposed to having to manually crank the blade around. Electric blenders also gave cooks greater control over how much they wanted their ingredients blended up as they could adjust the speed of the blades with a dial or switch on the machine itself.

Electric blenders were mainly used in households during this era but they were also popular in bars where drinks like margaritas and daiquiris were created by adding crushed ice into the blender with other ingredients such as liqueurs or juice concentrates before being blended together until smooth. And while these handheld versions of electric blenders may not have been able to crush ice as well as modern day models, they still got the job done! 

The invention of electric blenders marked a shift in how people prepared food at home, offering greater convenience and speed than ever before thanks to its motorized blades that did all of the work for you! Itâ€™s no wonder why these devices are still so popular today nearly 100 years later!
