If you’re looking for a new GE stove, you’ll need to know the model number. The model number is essential for finding the right parts and accessories, as well as determining the warranty coverage for your appliance. Fortunately, finding the model number on a GE stove is simple.

The model number on a GE stove can be found in one of two places. The first place to look is inside the oven door. On most models, there will be a small metal tag with the model and serial numbers printed on it. Simply open the oven door and check the inside of the frame for this tag.

If you don’t find a tag inside the oven door, then you’ll need to look at the back panel of the stove. Most GE stoves have a metal panel on the back that can be removed by unscrewing several screws. Once this panel is removed, you should see a metal tag with the model and serial numbers printed on it.

Once you’ve located your GE stove’s model number, you can use it to find all of the parts and accessories needed for your appliance. You can also use it to determine how long your warranty coverage lasts and what type of repairs are covered under your warranty. Knowing your GE stove’s model number is essential for keeping it running smoothly and efficiently for years to come!
