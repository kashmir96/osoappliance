## Get Rid of Indesit F05 Errors with This Simple Guide

If you have a malfunctioning Indesit-branded appliance which is displaying an F05 error code, you may be at a loss as to how to fix it. Fortunately, it could be something fairly simple, and with the right instructions, you can quickly reset your machine and get back to normal--even if you're unfamiliar with how to troubleshoot your appliance. Read on to find out how to reset Indesit F05 errors in just a few steps.

The first thing you should do if your machine is displaying an F05 error code is to unplug it and then plug it back in. Before it comes completely on and begins to reset, press and hold the start/pause button for 10 seconds. This will help to clear any errors in the system. 

The next step is to check for any blockages or kinks in the drain hose. The drain hose needs to be able to drain the water from the machine successfully, and if the water is not getting out, then it can cause a malfunction. Make sure that the hose is not snagged on any part of the machine and that it is positioned correctly for water to drain away from the machine.

In some cases, the F05 error code may be caused by a faulty pressure switch that won't allow the machine to start correctly. If your pressure switch is not working correctly, you may need to replace it. There are many instructional videos online to help guide you through this process. 

Finally, if these steps do not resolve the error code, it may be best to contact an Indesit-certified service technician to diagnose the problem further.

After following the steps in this guide, your machine should be reset and working correctly--and no longer displaying an F05 error code. But if you ever run into any other error codes, be sure to reference our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for all the information you need to diagnose and troubleshoot your machine.
