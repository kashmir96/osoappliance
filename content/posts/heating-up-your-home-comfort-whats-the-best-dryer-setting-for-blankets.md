## The Right Dryer Setting for Cozy Blankets

For many of us, blankets are the key to home comfort. Cuddling up with a warm blanket is often the highlight of the day. Keeping your blankets soft and snug isn’t hard if you have the right dryer setting. It’s important to get it right so your blankets don’t get damaged in the heat.

When you’re drying your blankets, it’s best to choose the delicate cycle. This will keep your blankets from getting too hot and destroying the fabric, threading, and glue inside. For electric dryers, this setting is often labeled with a small flower or snowflake on the control dial. This cycle is usually best for delicate fabrics like fleece and certain synthetic fibers.

Some people might find the delicate cycle is too cool to dry the blankets. If that’s the case, then opt for the permanent press cycle. This setting still won’t damage the blankets, but it is a bit hotter. This setting is also ideal for items like pillows and comforters. Some homes may even come with a cycle specifically designed for blankets. If there’s no dedicated cycle, then permanent press is usually the next best option.

When drying your blankets, it’s important to leave them slightly damp. This will help avoid wrinkles in the fabric and lessen their susceptibility to static. When your blankets are damp and still warm from the dryer, it’s best to hang them up for a quick finish.

Getting the right dryer setting for blankets will help give you maximum cushion and warmth when it’s time to relax. To ensure you’re prepared for the coziest season of the year, it’s important to get the right appliances. Check out our Overview of Top Appliances to see what’s best for your home.
