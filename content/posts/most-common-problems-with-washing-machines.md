If your washing machine isn't working as it should, there are a few common problems you can check for before calling a technician. Here are some of the most common problems with washing machines and what you can do to fix them.

1) Leaking Water: If your washing machine is leaking water, this could be caused by a few things. Check the hoses for any kinks or blockages, and make sure they are properly connected to the hot and cold water sources. Inspect the seals around the door to make sure they aren’t worn or damaged. You may also want to check if there’s any build-up of soap residue inside that could be blocking the drain or causing leaks in other areas of the machine. 

2) Noisy Operation: Washing machines can get quite noisy during operation, but if it’s louder than usual this could be an indication of something wrong. Make sure all parts are properly attached and not loose, especially around the tub where rattling noises often come from when objects become loose from vibration during operation. Also check for any debris in between components like nuts and bolts that could create more noise than normal when spinning or agitating clothes. 

3) Not Draining Properly: If your washing machine isn’t draining properly after each cycle then there could be a number of reasons why this might be happening. Check that all parts such as hoses, filters, drain outlets etc., are clear from blockages caused by lint or dirt build-up which is common in older washers that don’t self-clean regularly like newer models do today. Also make sure all connections around these components are secure and not loose which can cause poor draining performance as well as other issues like leaking water due to improper seals being used on these areas of your washer's design features.. 

4) Not Spinning Properly: A common issue with washing machines is when they don’t spin correctly either at full speed or at all during certain cycles. This problem usually has something to do with either a faulty motor belt inside that needs replacing, an overfilled drum causing imbalance, or just excessive amounts of soap residue clogging up certain parts within its inner workings like valves etc.. To fix this issue it would require some basic maintenance work where you should start by checking all moving parts for wear & tear then replace them accordingly if needed before calling out a technician for further assistance if needed afterwards.. 


By following these steps you should have no problem getting your washing machine back into shape in no time! If however none of these solutions work then it may be best to call out an experienced technician who will know exactly what needs doing in order to repair it correctly without causing further damage down the line!
