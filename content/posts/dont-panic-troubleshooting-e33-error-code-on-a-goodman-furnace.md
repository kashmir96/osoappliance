## Don't Stress: Resolving E33 Error on A Goodman Furnace 
When you're at home trying to stay comfortable, you don't want to run into any issues with your Goodman furnace. Encountering an E33 error code can be a source of major frustration, however, you should know that there are steps you can take to remedy this issue. 

The E33 error code indicates that your furnace's blower system is experiencing a malfunction. It could be because of a blower capacitor issue or a broken blower motor. Before you begin any troubleshooting, always make sure your furnace's power switch is in the "On" position. 

This error code can be attributed to a lack of power to the furnace, or it might be a result of a blown fuse. If you're seeing an E33 code, it should be easy to tell whether the problem is stemming from a blown fuse, as the display panel will likely be off. To check and see if the problem lies within the fuse, go to your furnace's breaker box and look for the circuit breaker. If the electronic switch is in the "Off" position, switch it to "On" and wait a few minutes for the transformer to source power. 

If the problem persists, then check the blower capacitor to see whether it's functioning. The capacitor is responsible for supplying additional energy to the blower motor, so if it's not working, then the motor won't be able to run. To test this part, attach an ohmmeter or a multifunction tester to the capacitor, and if no electrical current is being read, then the capacitor needs to be replaced. 

Another possible source of the E33 error is your furnace's blower motor. If the blower capacitor is functioning, then disconnect the wires leading to the blower motor. Connect the ohmmeter to the two terminals of the blower motor and test for current. If you are not seeing any current, then the blower motor needs to be replaced. 

If all else fails, you should reach out to a trusted technician. Our [directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) has hundreds of professionals who specialize in Goodman furnace repair and can provide you with reliable advice and a satisfactory repair job. 

Troubleshooting an E33 error code on a Goodman furnace may feel daunting at first, but don't panic! With a bit of patience and by utilizing the steps outlined above, you can get your furnace running properly and your home back to a comfortable temperature.

## Troubleshooting Goodman Furnace E33 Error Code

1. What is the Goodman furnace E33 error code?
The Goodman furnace E33 error code indicates that the furnace's igniter has failed to light the gas burner.

2. What are the possible causes of a Goodman furnace E33 error code?
The possible causes of a Goodman furnace E33 error code include a faulty furnace flame sensor, faulty igniter, dirty burners, and faulty supply pressure regulator.

3. What should I do if my Goodman furnace displays an E33 error code?
If your Goodman furnace displays an E33 error code, first check to make sure the furnace is receiving power and that nothing is blocking the flame sensor from being able to detect the flame. If the power supply and flame sensor are functioning properly, then you'll need to check for blocked burners, a faulty igniter or supply pressure regulator, and verify the gas valve is open.

4. How can I tell if my Goodman furnace igniter is faulty?
The best way to tell if your Goodman furnace igniter is faulty is to first check for a visible spark when the igniter is active. If it is not sparking, the igniter will need to be replaced.

5. How do I check the Goodman furnace flame sensor?
The Goodman furnace flame sensor should be checked by using a multimeter to test for continuity. When the multimeter is placed between the two leads of the flame sensor, there should be a reading. If there is no reading, then the flame sensor will need to be replaced.

## Troubleshooting E33 Error on Goodman Furnace 
1. E33 error code indicates a blower system issue, possibly with the blower capacitor or motor. 
2. Check the furnace's power switch is in the "On" position and check circuit breaker in the breaker box if display panel is off. 
3. Test the blower capacitor with an ohmmeter and replace if it's not working. 
4. Disconnect the wiring for the blower motor and test for current with an ohmmeter. 
5. If all else fails, contact an appliance repair technician for help.
