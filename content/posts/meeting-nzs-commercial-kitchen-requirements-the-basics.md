## Ensuring that NZ's Commercial Kitchen is Meeting Basic Requirements

When it comes to improving the efficiency and safety of any commercial kitchen, it is essential that they are meeting New Zealand's legal requirements. This blog provides an overview of the basics in meeting these demands.

When meeting NZ's commercial kitchen requirements, owners should pay attention to the design and installation of the kitchen to ensure that it is safe and energy efficient. Health and safety should be of the utmost importance, so all individuals working in the kitchen must be familiar with the safety protocols and necessary measures must be taken to keep food safe. Measures include maintaining a suitable food storage temperature and following good hygiene practices.

From an energy efficiency standpoint, it makes sense to invest in appliances that are energy efficient. This will not only help save money on electricity bills and reduce your environmental impact, but it can also help kitchen staff work more efficiently. Appliances should also be certified by the New Zealand Electrical Safety Authority and have adequate ventilation in place.

It is also worth bearing in mind that specific appliances have specific requirements, such as gas safety and water safety requirements. It is therefore important to research any appliances you are considering purchasing and find out information from reliable sources.

Having the proper infrastructure in place is essential for any commercial kitchen. This includes adequate fire retreat, zero-cross detection and heat mats for reducing the risk of heat exhaustion. Furthermore, it is important to ensure the entire kitchen is up to date with regular building and equipment maintenance.

In conclusion, there are a variety of measures that need to be taken when meeting NZ's commercial kitchen requirements. Investing in energy-efficient appliances, maintaining a suitable food storage temperature and ensuring the necessary safety certifications are in place are just some of the key steps owners need to take to keep their kitchen up to industry standards.
