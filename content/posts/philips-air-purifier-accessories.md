When it comes to air purifiers, Philips is one of the top brands. Philips offers a wide range of air purifier accessories that help you get the most out of your air purifier. From filters to remote controls, there are a variety of accessories available to make your air purifier more efficient and effective. 

Filters
The most important accessory for an air purifier is the filter. Philips offers a variety of filters designed specifically for their air purifiers. Depending on the type and size of your unit, you can choose from HEPA filters, activated carbon filters, and other specialized filter types. The right filter helps capture dust particles and allergens as small as 0.3 microns in size for maximum filtration performance.

Remote Control
Philips also offers several remote control options for their air purifiers so you can adjust settings from anywhere in the room. You can easily monitor and adjust fan speed or timer settings with just a press of a button without having to get up from your seat! 

Air Quality Sensors 
To ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness, many Philips models come with built-in sensors that detect changes in airborne pollutants such as pollen or dust particles and automatically adjust fan speeds accordingly. This allows you to enjoy clean air without having to constantly monitor settings yourself! 

Cleaning Kits 
In addition to providing efficient filtration capabilities, Philips also provides cleaning kits so you can keep your unit running at peak performance levels all year round! These kits include everything you need to safely clean both internal components like fans and external components like grilles or housings quickly and easily at home. 

 By investing in these essential accessories for your Philips Air Purifier, you can enjoy fresher breathing space all year round while ensuring optimal performance from your unit!
