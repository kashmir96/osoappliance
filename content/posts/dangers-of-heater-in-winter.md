As the winter season approaches, many of us turn to the warmth and comfort of our home heaters to keep us warm. While having a home heater is a great way to stay comfortable in the cold weather, it’s important to be aware of some of the risks that come along with using them.

One major, yet often overlooked danger associated with home heaters is fire safety. Homes heated by oil-fired furnaces are more likely to experience a home fire due to these appliances not being properly maintained and serviced annually. To reduce your risk of a dangerous fire outbreak, always make sure your furnace is receiving annual maintenance from a certified technician. Additionally, be sure to follow all manufacturer instructions when operating your heater and keep combustibles like fabric away from it. 

Another potential danger of using heaters for extended periods during winter is carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless gas that can be released when burning any type of fuel in an enclosed space or without proper ventilation or exhaust systems in place. To avoid this health hazard, install CO detectors near your heating units and promptly replace any heating units that are older than 15 years old – they may not be venting properly anymore and can cause hazardous conditions inside your home if not replaced.. 

Finally, electric space heaters are dangerous if used improperly or around water sources such as bathtubs or sinks as they may cause electrocution or shocks if touched while still plugged into an outlet - always unplug them before you leave the room! Overheating can also occur if left running for too long, so make sure you follow manufacturer instructions for use and never leave them running unattended for extended periods of time as this increases the risk of fires even further. 

It’s important to remember that although home heating units do provide us with much needed warmth during cold winter months, taking extra precautions when using them can go a long way towards ensuring our safety!
