An air purifier is an essential device for anyone looking to improve their home’s air quality. But, how do you use it effectively? To help you out, here are some tips on how to get the most out of your air purifier. 

1. Choose the Right Size - It’s important to choose an air purifier that’s the right size for your space. An undersized purifier won’t be able to clean enough of the air in your home, while an oversized one will waste energy by operating at full power when it doesn’t need to. The best way to find a suitable size is by measuring the area you want to cover and comparing it with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

2. Change Filters Regularly – Your air purifier will need new filters periodically in order to continue working efficiently and effectively. Depending on your model and usage, this could be every few months or once a year — so be sure you check your owner's manual for information about when they should be replaced. 

3. Clean Surrounding Areas - Dust and debris accumulate not only in the room itself but also around furniture, curtains, rugs and other items — so make sure these areas are vacuumed regularly too! This will create less work for your air purifier as it won't have as much dust and dirt particles in its filter already when it goes into action. 

4. Use On High Speed When Needed - While running on a low setting helps save energy costs, if you notice that dust or odors still linger then try switching up the speed settings until you get better results from your machine! This can help reduce indoor pollution levels quickly, allowing for fresher and cleaner air throughout your home again soon after turning up its power level temporarily 

5 . Keep Windows Closed – If possible keep windows closed while running an air purifier since open windows can let outside pollution seep into indoors again easily enough! This also applies while using fans or other ventilation devices like central AC systems as well — close them off if possible before turning on any kind of fan-based device inside too! 

Following these tips should help ensure that you get maximum effectiveness from your air purifier without wasting energy or overworking either yourself or the machine itself!
