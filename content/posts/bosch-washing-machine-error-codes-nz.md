# Bosch washing machine error codes nz

If you own a Bosch washing machine, chances are that at some point it may display an error code. If this happens, don’t panic! Error codes are designed to help identify problems and provide solutions to get your machine working again. This blog will explain the common Bosch washing machine error codes in New Zealand, what they mean, and what you can do to fix them.

The most common Bosch washer error codes in NZ include E10, E13 and E17. The code E10 indicates an issue with the water supply to the washing machine and could be caused by a faulty pressure switch or a blocked inlet filter. To resolve this issue you will need to check the water supply is turned on and clean any dirt or debris from the filter. You may also need to contact a professional for further assistance if necessary. 

The code E13 indicates that there is an issue with draining water from the drum of your washing machine. This could be caused by clogged drain pipe or even overloading of your washer with too much clothing. To fix this issue you will need to ensure nothing is blocking the drainage pipe and reduce the load size of your wash cycle if necessary. 

Lastly, error code E17 may appear when there is a problem with draining during the spin cycle due to excessive suds buildup inside of your washer’s drum cavity. To resolve this issue you will need to use less detergent next time when doing laundry or rinse off any residual suds before spinning again afterwards. 

In conclusion, being aware of these common Bosch washing machine error codes in NZ can help you identify potential issues quickly before it becomes worse as well as know how best to troubleshoot them while keeping your appliance running smoothly at all times!
