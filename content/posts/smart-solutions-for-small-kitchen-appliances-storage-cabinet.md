## Maximizing Storage Space for Household Appliances 

Having a lot of small kitchen appliances can be a blessing and a curse. They improve everyday life and make it easier to make healthy and delicious meals, but they can also occupy precious real estate in storage cabinets.

Many families have tried to juggle between their other necessities and their appliances, but that doesnâ€™t have to be the case. With a little bit of organizing, the space in your kitchen can be maximized for both your other items and your kitchen appliances. 

Creating allocated spaces for different appliances is the best first step. You can use drawer organizers for small appliances, like mixers and blenders, or use adjustable shelves for larger items, like cuisinarts and microwaves. You can also vary the size of your shelves from one to the next depending on what items you store. 

You can even add hooks and rods to hang lighter weight appliances, like can openers and toasters. Optional dividers are also available to customize the cabinets even further. Having well arranged cabinets will help you save time and energy, as well as make it easier to find what you need when cooking. 

There are many creative ways to store your kitchen appliances to make sure your kitchen is functional and efficient. DIY projects, such as hanging your pots or mounting a lazy susan, could also be an option. 

No matter the size of your kitchen, you can work some wonder and make the most out of your limited space with a little bit of creativity and smart organizing. To learn more about the best household appliances, visit our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) page.
