## Beat the Heat with Portable Aircon Solutions in NZ

With the coming of summer and warm weather in New Zealand, a cool indoor climate can seem impossible to achieve. Air conditioning can be expensive and an energy drain, but there is a range of new energy efficient Portable Aircon Solutions available in the NZ market. 

Portable air conditioners are self-contained units that sit inside a window, wall opening or other suitable gap. They have powerful fans to draw in hot air from indoors, cool it through a condenser and exhaust cooler air outdoors. Portable air conditioners are much less expensive than installing a central cooling system and are suited to single rooms or multi-room applications, as they can be plugged in where they are needed, rather than having to duct multiple units throughout the home.

Transportable air conditioners are designed to be moved to different rooms as required. If you are lucky enough to have an outdoor area with an external electrical point you may be able to double up and utilise this outdoor area for your air conditioned room. Many portable air conditioners also come with an integrated dehumidifier, meaning you donâ€™t have to buy a separate device.

To decrease energy usage and cost, look for models with efficient cooling technology. While some models do use up a lot of energy, efficient models enable a greener solution to your climate control needs as they can reduce energy costs by up to 40%.

At the end of the day, the best cooling solution for your individual needs might be a combination of a few different methods, including a portable aircon, window panels and personal cooling products, such as fans and electric coolers.

Cooling your home during summer can be a daunting task, and there are many great Portable Aircon Solutions available in NZ. From self-contained units to transportable, energy efficient models, there is an aircon solution to fit your needs.
