## Easily Install a Wall Mounted Microwave 

Installing a wall mounted microwave is a great way to gain more counter space in your kitchen. Knowing how to install a new appliance can be complex, but thankfully you don't have to be an expert technician to do it yourself! In this guide, we'll provide some step-by-step instructions on how to easily install a wall mounted microwave. 

Before you begin to install the microwave, make sure to double check and ensure that you have all the necessary parts and tools. Depending on the appliance, you may need a power cord, accessories, and/or mounting plates. Once you have all the parts ready and in good condition, turn off the power to the area, and make sure to keep the area well ventilated. 

The next step in the process is to mark the mounting location on the wall. Make sure that there is an appropriate distance from the wall to the appliance, based on the manufacturer's instructions and local codes. An important safety tip for this step is to secure a stud finder to the marked wall location. This will help you know where to bore out the wall if necessary. 

Once you have marked the wall and determined the necessary measurements, drill pilot holes as directed and connect the mounting hardware. With the hardware secured, insert the microwave into the mounting bracket and secure the appliance with bolts. Now, insert the power cord according to the manufacturer's installation manual.

The final step is to raise and level the appliance. Again, use a level to make sure that the microwave is installed correctly and level to the ground. With everything checked over, you can now turn the power to the area back on, and test out your new wall mounted microwave! 

Installing a wall mounted microwave is a great way to save on countertop space and look stylish at the same time.
