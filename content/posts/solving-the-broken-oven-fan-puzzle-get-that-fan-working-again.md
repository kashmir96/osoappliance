## Troubleshooting Your Oven's Fan and Getting It Working Again
Are you having trouble with your oven's fan? Don't worry, we'll walk you through the steps to help get the fan working again and save you the trouble of replacing it.

The first step to solving the oven fan puzzle is to check for any debris or food particles that have become trapped in the fan’s blades. If you do find any, carefully remove them and then reassemble the fan by firmly pressing the fan into its mounting brackets.

Next, check all the wiring to make sure that none of the cables are frayed or broken. If they are, you'll want to replace them in order to avoid any electrical issues or fire hazards.

If the fan still isn’t working, then you can test it by carefully bypassing the fan’s relay switch. This is best done by an electrician or an appliance repair professional. The electrician will be able to determine whether the fan is faulty or if it is due to a wiring issue.

If the fan still doesn't work, the next option would be to purchase a new fan and install it yourself, or you can find an experienced appliance repair technician to help you.
