Air fluff, also known as no heat or no heat tumble, is a setting found on many modern clothes dryers. It’s designed to provide a gentler alternative to the hot air of a standard drying cycle. 

Air fluff works by circulating air through the dryer without any additional heat. This means that clothes are dried without the risk of damage from high temperatures. The air fluff setting is ideal for items that are made of delicate fabrics, such as lingerie, sweaters, and other items that may be sensitive to heat.

The air fluff setting is also great for items that don’t need to be completely dried, such as jeans and other items that can be hung up to dry. The air fluff setting will help remove any moisture from the fabric, but won’t dry the item completely.

The air fluff setting is also useful for items that may be prone to shrinkage, such as wool and other fabrics that can be easily damaged by heat. The air fluff setting will help reduce the risk of shrinkage and help keep the fabric looking its best.

Overall, the air fluff setting is a great way to dry delicate items without the risk of damage from heat. It’s also a great way to dry items that don’t need to be completely dried, such as jeans and other items that can be hung up to dry.
