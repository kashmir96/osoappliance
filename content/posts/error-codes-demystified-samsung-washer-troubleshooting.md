## Demystifying Samsung Washer Error Codes

Troubleshooting household appliances can sometimes seem overwhelming. But with a little knowledge, anyone can troubleshoot a Samsung washer and interpret the error codes. Error codes let users know that something is out of the ordinary with the washer and is readable even for the least tech-savvy consumer. In this blog, you'll learn about Samsung washer error codes and how to interpret them. 

Error codes range from 'E10' to 'E99' and can vary in severity from minor to serious. Depending on the model and the code, some possibilities include a fan error, a blocked filter, and lack of water flow. In many cases, the error code requires one to remove and clean the filter located inside the machine. A few simple solutions can help users restore the washing machine back to normal operation.

One way to tackle such issues is to reset the machine. This can be done by unplugging it and then plugging it back in. Another option is to check the water pressure. If the error code directs the user to inspect a specific part, appliance repair experts recommend users to check the drain pump, and if the drain filter is clogged. As a last resort, users can contact Samsung directly and speak with a customer service representative. 

When dealing with household appliances, it is important to never ignore error codes. Since not all errors are the same and require different solutions, one must be familiar with the manual and be aware of the specific model and its unique functions. Being savvy about error codes can help users figure out the malfunctioning part before deciding on whether to repair it or call for service.
