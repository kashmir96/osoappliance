## Turning Scrap into a Financial Success in Christchurch

If you’ve ever tried to figure out what to do with old, broken appliances or scrap metal, then the success story of Christchurch’s Cash For Scrap is inspiring. This kiwi business has been able to turn scrap metal into a steady financial revenue stream, with the help of effective business practices and a passionate team.

Cash For Scrap was founded in 2016 by Blake Lambert, who noticed the local need for a service that could efficiently collect, process and recycle scrap metal. The business started off as just a man with a van but has since grown to include two full-time staff members, an office, workshops, and over 25 vehicles.

Instead of charities and dumps, Cash For Scrap offers urban developments, schools, and local organizations the opportunity to turn metals like copper, aluminium, and steel into money. Businesses and households are able to check their scrap metal tallies online, which helps to ensure a responsible and accountable system. 

The scrap metal industry is highly regulated and in order to remain sustainable, it is important to stay safe and compliant. Cash For Scrap has done a great job of making sure its practices are up to date with safety requirements and environmental issues. 

What makes this success story truly remarkable is that it provides a great example of what can be done with scrap metal. That so much money can be made from something seemingly valueless is a testament to the creative spirit of Christchurch’s Cash For Scrap.
