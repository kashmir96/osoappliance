If your washing machine is making a loud noise when it's spinning, you may be wondering what's wrong and what you can do about it. While some noises are normal and nothing to worry about, others could be a sign of an issue that needs to be addressed before the damage becomes more serious. 

The most common cause of a noisy washing machine is an unbalanced load. When clothes are unevenly distributed in the drum, they can create rumbling and thumping sounds during the spin cycle. To ensure your clothes are evenly distributed, try adding some bulkier items or remove any large items from their pockets before loading them into the washer. You should also make sure that the laundry load isn't too large—overloading your washer can cause noises as well as damaging your appliance over time.

If these steps don’t fix the problem, another possible cause of a noisy washing machine could be worn out or broken components inside the drum or motor assembly. If this is likely to be true in your case, you will want to contact an appliance repair technician for further assistance as soon as possible before any further damage occurs.
