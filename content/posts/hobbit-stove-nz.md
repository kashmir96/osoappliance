If you're a fan of the Hobbit film franchise, then you know that Bilbo Baggins and the other dwarves cooked their meals on an old-fashioned wood-burning stove. This classic Kiwi invention is not only practical but also adds charm and character to any home. 

The Hobbit stove, also known as the “Hobbit Cooker”, was designed by New Zealanders Tony and Julie Appleton in 1977. It is a compact cast-iron stove with two side doors for loading fuel, a large oven door in front for baking, a large firebox for burning wood logs or charcoal, and several vents to control the heat output. The Hobbit stove is efficient at producing heat without having to use too much fuel. It’s also perfect for slow cooking stews or roasts making it ideal for camping trips or cozy nights at home by the fire. 

If you’re looking to buy your own Hobbit Stove there are plenty of options available online as well as in stores throughout New Zealand. Prices range from around NZ$1,000 up depending on your model and features so shop around before making your purchase! You should also consider getting your chimney checked before installing your new cooker as it will need to be properly ventilated in order to work safely. 

The Hobbit Stove is truly an iconic Kiwi invention that has stood the test of time and continues to bring warmth and nostalgia into our homes today. Whether you need extra heat during winter months or just want a charming addition to your living space – this unique little cooker is sure to do the job!
