Are you a student living in a dorm or an apartment and need help understanding how to use your washing machine? Washing clothes is an essential part of life, but if you’re unfamiliar with the process, it can be confusing. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered! In this blog post, we’ll provide a guide on how to use a washing machine so you can keep your clothes looking fresh.

First things first – before you get started, make sure that your washer is properly connected to the water source and electricity outlet. Once that’s taken care of, it’s time to start loading your laundry into the washer. Be sure not to overload it – too much clothing will cause wear and tear on the machine and won’t allow for proper cleaning. Separate whites from colors to prevent any discoloration as well. 

Next up, add detergent according to package instructions – usually about 2 tablespoons per load should do the trick. Don’t forget fabric softener or other cleaner if needed! Now it's time to choose what kind of cycle you'd like: hot for whites and heavily soiled items; warm for colors; cold for delicate items; or even extra-long cycles for larger loads. 

Once all these steps are complete, press ‘start'! Depending on the size of your load and type of cycle chosen, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes up to several hours before completion. When finished, unload immediately — if left sitting in water too long they could become mildewed — then hang them up or toss them into dryer (if available) right away so they don't wrinkle while waiting! 

And there you have it - using a washing machine doesn't have to be daunting after all! With these simple steps in mind, now you'll be able to tackle laundry day like a pro in no time at all!
