## Don't Gamble on Fixing a Broken Oven Thermostat
When attempting to fix a broken oven thermostat, you should never resort to trial and error as it can be a time consuming and expensive method. Diagnosing and repairing an oven thermostat can be daunting and it is always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to the safety of your kitchen and appliances.

In order to identify the source of the problem and find the most suitable solution, it is necessary to understand the causes and symptoms of a broken oven thermostat. Common causes for a thermostat to malfunction may include:

- Loose connections
- Poor circuit board health
- Corrosion of wires and components 
- Heating element failure
- Wiring short circuits

If the problem is caused by an external factor, then immediately examine the surrounding area and appliance to identify any potential sources of damage or safety hazards. If you still cannot pinpoint the root cause, then it is important to consult with an experienced and qualified appliance repair expert.
