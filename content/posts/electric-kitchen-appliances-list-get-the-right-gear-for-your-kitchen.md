## Have the Right Gear in Your Kitchen with an Essential Kitchen Appliance List

When you set up a new kitchen, the key to success lies in the appliance list: you need the right tools for a functioning, modern, and organized kitchen. With so many different options, selecting the best appliances for your kitchen can feel overwhelming – but it doesn’t have to be complicated. 

A good starting point is to break down the list of electric kitchen appliances into key types: refrigerators; cooking tools like stovetop and ovens; sinks, ranges and some other pieces of kitchen equipment. Depending on the size of your kitchen and personal preference, you’ll want to make sure you have a good mix of each.

Refrigerators come in several different sizes, with standard models falling between 18 and 36 inches. Consider your space, lifestyle and product needs when narrowing down your options. For example, if your family tends to shop more frequently, then you might opt for a larger size. 

Next up, the stovetop and oven. Induction cooktops make cooking easy to clean with their smooth tops and faster heat up times, while larger ovens are great for those who cook large meals frequently. 

It's also important to include sinks. Stainless steel kitchen sinks are an excellent choice for modern kitchens, as they’re durable and easy to clean. 

Last but not least, range hoods are essential for keeping the air around your oven, stovetop and refrigerator clean and free from any lingering odors.

These are the main items that should be included in any electric kitchen appliance list. For more information and choices, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview). This exhaustive list can help you research, compare and purchase the devices that fit your lifestyle. 

Creating the perfect electric kitchen appliance list is an important part of setting up a modern, efficient kitchen. With the right gear, you’ll have all the tools you need to whip up delicious meals and treats with ease!
