Dryers are an essential part of any home, but how long do they last? The answer to this question depends on a variety of factors, including the type of dryer, how often it is used, and how well it is maintained.

The average lifespan of a dryer is around 10-13 years. However, this number can vary significantly depending on the type of dryer you have. Gas dryers tend to last longer than electric dryers, with an average lifespan of 15-17 years. On the other hand, electric dryers typically last around 10-13 years.

The frequency of use is also a major factor in determining how long a dryer will last. If you use your dryer regularly, it will likely need to be replaced sooner than if it is only used occasionally. This is because the more often you use your dryer, the more wear and tear it will experience.

Finally, how well you maintain your dryer can also have an impact on its lifespan. Regularly cleaning the lint trap and venting system can help to keep your dryer running efficiently, while also preventing fires. Additionally, having your dryer serviced by a professional every few years can help to extend its life.

Overall, the answer to the question “how long does a dryer last?” depends on a variety of factors. On average, a dryer should last around 10-13 years, but this number can vary significantly depending on the type of dryer, how often it is used, and how well it is maintained.
