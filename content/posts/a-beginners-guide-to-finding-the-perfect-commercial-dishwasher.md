## Finding the Ideal Commercial Dishwasher for Your Needs

If you’re in the market for a commercial dishwasher that can handle the needs of a restaurant, bar, or other commercial kitchen, you’ll find a variety of options available. Knowing the key factors to consider and available options will help you make the right choice for your business. 

When shopping for a commercial dishwasher, you should consider how much it will cost, how often it will be used, and how much volume will be processed each day. You’ll also want to think about the space available for installation and the type of dishwasher that best suits your needs. 

Cost is a major factor when choosing a commercial dishwasher. The cost of the unit itself is one thing, but other considerations like installation, repair, and regular maintenance also play a role. It’s important to budget for the long-term costs of ownership, not just the sticker price. 

The cycle time of the dishwasher will give you an idea of how often it needs to be used to keep up with the demand. A unit with high throughput will have a faster cycle time than one with a lower throughput. Longer cycles will be more efficient, but they’ll also require more space, which could be a challenge in a small kitchen. 

In terms of space, consider the available space for installation and consider the size of the dish racks, trays, and other items that will need to be processed in the machine. That will help you determine if a conveyor dishwasher, countertop dishwasher, or undercounter dishwasher is right for the job. 

It’s also important to consider the various features available on the dishwasher. Look for features like central controls and maintenance indicators that will help you monitor and maintain the machine. You may also want to look for DishSense™ technology, which can sense the soil load and adjust the cycle accordingly for optimal cleaning performance. 

In conclusion, there’s a lot to consider when choosing a commercial dishwasher for your kitchen. You’ll want to weigh the cost, cycle time, space, and features to determine the ideal unit for your needs. And when you’re ready to install it, look to our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians to help get the job done.
