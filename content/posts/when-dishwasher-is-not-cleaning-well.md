If your dishwasher is not cleaning dishes well, there are several potential causes. The most common cause of poor dishwasher cleaning is improper loading. If dishes are not loaded correctly, they can block the spray arm from spinning and prevent the water from reaching all of the items in the basket. Additionally, if there isn't enough space between items in the dishwasher, it can prevent water and detergent from reaching them properly.

Another common cause of poor dishwashing is clogged filters. Dishwashers have filters that collect food particles, which need to be cleaned regularly to ensure that they don't become clogged and inhibit water flow. Additionally, if the filter gets too dirty it will create a layer of grease on the dishes instead of cleaning them properly.

In some cases, poor dishwasher cleaning may be caused by a worn out spray arm or pump motor. If either of these components fail to spin or move at full speed then they may not be able to provide enough pressure to clean dishes properly. If this is the case then you'll need to replace them in order for your dishwasher to perform optimally again. 

Finally, if you're using an old or low-quality detergent then it may not be powerful enough to effectively clean your dishes. It's important to use a good-quality detergent that has been specifically designed for dishwashers in order to get optimal results from your appliance. 

By troubleshooting these potential causes you should be able to identify and address any issues with your dishwashing performance and get back on track with sparkling clean dishes!
