## How Much Do Laundromats Make a Month? 

So, you want to know how much money laundromats make a month? It's no secret that the laundry industry is an extremely profitable one. But how much exactly do these businesses bring in? That depends on a variety of factors such as location, operating costs, and customer base. 

On average, laundromats can generate anywhere from $500 to $30,000 per month in revenue. However, most mid-sized to large operations can bring in around $10k-$20k a month when factoring in all sources of income. This includes coin-operated laundry machines, dry cleaning services and other related services offered at the facility. 

The cost of operating a laundromat also varies widely depending on factors like size and number of machines being used. Typically speaking though, it takes between $1-$2 per load to cover both labor costs and machine maintenance/repair expenses. To maximize profits it’s important for business owners to regularly maintain their equipment and ensure that all machines are functioning properly at all times—this could include anything from replacing parts or unclogging pipes if need be. When done correctly this can help reduce costly appliance repairs down the line which may otherwise cut into profits significantly over time due to having to replace older models or pay for service calls frequently. 

Laundry businesses are highly lucrative endeavors with room for growth if managed properly over time—so if you’re looking into starting your own operation it’s important that you weigh out the potential risks involved before jumping into the game head first!
