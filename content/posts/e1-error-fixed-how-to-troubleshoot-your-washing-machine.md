## Troubleshooting an E1 Error in Your Washing Machine
Most people rely on their washing machine to keep their clothes clean. Therefore, when the machine doesn't work due to an error code, it can be frustrating. Fortunately, the E1 error in a washing machine is relatively easy to troubleshoot and repair.

If you have an E1 error code on the display of your washing machine, it means the control board has failed to detect water supply. It is possible to restart the board manually in order to check if the machine can detect water. First, unplug the washing machine from the power outlet. Wait ten seconds and then plug it back in. This will restart the control board in the washing machine.

If the E1 error code is still displayed, it likely means that the water level pressure switch is unable to detect water. You can test the pressure switch to see if it is working properly. The pressure switch is responsible for detecting the water level in a washing machine. To test it, first unplug the washing machine from the power source. Raise the top of the machine to gain access to the hose attached to the switch. Using a multimeter, carefully check for two lines of voltage on the pressure switch. If there is no voltage, it likely means that the pressure switch has malfunctioned. 

If you failed to detect any voltage from the pressure switch, it means that it will need to be replaced. It is an easy and affordable repair. Replacing the pressure switch will most likely fix your E1 error on the washing machine.

If you are ever unsure about how to troubleshoot the error code, donâ€™t hesitate to contact a professional technician. They would more than likely be able to help you evaluate the issue and advise on the most suitable solution.
