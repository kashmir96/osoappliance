The first electric clothes dryer was invented in the late 1800s by George Sampson, a British inventor. His invention was a metal drum that rotated over an open fire. The drum had holes in it so that the hot air could flow through, drying the clothes. This invention was later improved upon by American inventors such as Hamilton Smith, who created the first gas-powered dryer in 1892.

In 1918, J. Ross Moore patented the first electric clothes dryer which became popular for use in households throughout the 1920s. This machine used heated coils to warm air which then circulated through a rotating drum to dry clothing quickly and efficiently. In 1938, an improved model of this electric dryer was released with added features such as an automatic timer and thermostat control to regulate temperature levels.

The modern day tumble dryer is largely based off of this original design with some minor changes and improvements being made over time such as energy efficiency and safety features. Todayâ€™s tumble dryers are available in both electric and gas models and come in a variety of sizes to suit any household need or budget requirement. They are used in households all around the world to make laundry day more efficient and convenient than ever before!
