If you’ve noticed that your dryer isn’t heating up like it used to, it’s time to figure out the cause of the problem. A dryer that isn’t heating is a common issue that can be caused by several different factors. It can be frustrating trying to diagnose and fix the issue, but in this blog post we’ll cover some of the most common causes of an unheated dryer and how to troubleshoot them. 

The first and most common cause of a dryer not heating is a blown thermal fuse. This small device, located near the back of your dryer, is designed to cut off power if it detects too much heat in the unit. If this fuse has blown, you won’t get any heat at all from your dryer. To test for this issue, simply unplug your dryer and remove its back panel. Locate the thermal fuse and use an ohm meter or continuity tester to check for continuity. If there is no continuity, then you will need to replace the thermal fuse with a new one before powering up your machine again. 

Another common cause of a non-heating dryer is a faulty igniter or flame sensor. The igniter lights up when electricity passes through it and creates heat which starts up the drying process; while the flame sensor monitors whether or not there is an open flame present in order to keep things safe during operation. To test these components, disconnect power from your machine and remove its front panel so you can access them directly; then use an ohm meter on each component individually to check for continuity. If either one doesn’t have any continuity present then they will need replacing before you can begin using your machine again safely. 

Finally, if none of these tests show any issues then it could be possible that there is something wrong with either your gas valve or drum motor – both components which control how much fuel and air are drawn into the machine respectively during operation; as well as controlling drum speed which affects drying times too! To test these components you should consult with a qualified repair technician who specializes in appliance repairs as they will have access to specialized tools which are needed when dealing with electrical components such as these two items specifically. 

In conclusion, if your dryer isn't heating properly then there could be several different causes including something minor such as a blown thermal fuse; or something more complex such as faulty igniter/flame sensors or even issues with either gas valves or drums motors themselves! If none of these tests seem to identify what might be causing this issue then we recommend contacting an experienced repair technician who specializes in appliance repairs for further assistance!
