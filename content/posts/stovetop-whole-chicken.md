Cooking a whole chicken on the stovetop is a great way to enjoy a delicious and healthy meal with minimal effort. Not only is it a simple process, but the results are always juicy and flavorful. Plus, it’s a great way to use up any leftover vegetables or herbs you may have in your fridge!

To begin, you’ll need a large pot that fits your whole chicken. Place the chicken in the pot and season it generously with salt and pepper. Add any herbs or spices you would like, such as garlic, rosemary, or thyme. Then, fill the pot with enough water to cover the chicken completely. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and reduce to low heat. Simmer for about an hour or until the chicken is cooked through.

Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pot and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. During this time, you can prepare any sides you’d like to accompany your meal such as roasted potatoes or steamed vegetables.

Stovetop whole chickens are not only easy to make but also incredibly delicious! With minimal effort and ingredients, you can enjoy an amazing meal that is sure to please everyone at your table!
