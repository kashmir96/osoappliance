Whirlpool is a trusted brand when it comes to home appliances, and their dryer rack is no exception. The Whirlpool Dryer Rack is an innovative and convenient way to maximize the drying space of your dryer. It offers added capacity for bulky items, and can also be used to safely dry delicate clothing items without over-drying or damaging them.

The rack fits securely inside the drum of the dryer, allowing you to stack items on top of it that would otherwise not fit in the drum itself. You can put sweaters, bedding, or even activewear on it to ensure that all your clothes get dried evenly and quickly. The rack is also great for drying delicates like lingerie and hosiery – all you have to do is hang them on the rack, close the door of your dryer and let it do its job!

The Whirlpool Dryer Rack also makes cleaning out lint traps easier than ever – no more having lint stick around in hard-to-reach places! And since this rack helps keep clothes from getting tangled up during the drying cycle, you won’t have any more struggling with knots when transferring laundry from the washer to the dryer either.

Overall, this handy accessory makes doing laundry easier and more efficient – what could be better than that?
