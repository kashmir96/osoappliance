## Diagnosing an Int Error Code in Your Maytag WasherIf you're like most homeowners, one of your household responsibilities is doing laundry. And while Maytag washing machines are built to last, they can still experience the occasional problem or error code. If you see an Int error code on the digital display of your machine, the first thing to do is remain calm -- this is a fixable, common error. This guide will help you learn more about the Int error code on a Maytag washer and how to troubleshoot it.

### What Is an Int Error Code on a Maytag Washer?
The Int error code is a small hiccup produced by your washer as a result of an interruption in communication between the electronic control board and the user interface.

### How to Troubleshoot an Int Error Code
There are several steps to take when troubleshooting an Int error code. The first is to unplug the washer for a minute or two, release the power, then plug it back in. This should cause your washer to reset itself and may clear the error code. If this doesn’t work, you will need to check the internal components of your washer, in particular, the wiring harness or touchpad connections.

If the reset and component checks did not clear the Int error code, you may need to replace the control board. This can be tricky and should only be done by a professional appliance repair technician with the right experience, skills and tools. 

### Conclusion
Although an Int error code on a Maytag washer is a common issue, it often requires the expertise of a professional to fix it properly. Avoid putting yourself at risk from injury and avoid tampering with internal components. A certified appliance repair technician is your best bet to maintain the safety and performance of your machine.
