## Air Conditioning: Examining the Potential Perils

Air conditioning is often considered a vital amenity during a hot summer day or sweltering night. On occasion, however, improper use or misuse of air conditioning can land homeowners in a sticky situation. In this blog, we’ll take a look at the risks associated with AC systems and how to mitigate them.

Unfamiliarizing oneself with air conditioning components carries a myriad of risks. Those comprised of gas and/or electricity are especially hazardous. Complications may arise if a person attempts to inspect, maintain, or operate their air conditioning unit without the proper training. Even seemingly minor elements such as clogged air filters can adversely affect an AC system’s performance, causing it to become strained and suffer overheating. When this occurs, the AC will eventually cease to function, requiring assistance from a licensed appliance repair technician.

Another risk of air conditioning is the possibility of it being damaged by bad weather. If roof mounted AC units are left exposed, they may be subjected to strong winds or hail which can cause irreparable harm or malfunction. Simple precautionary measures, such as covering the AC when it’s not in use and checking for debris on a regular basis, can provide valuable peace of mind for homeowners.

Finally, installing air conditioning without proper guidance can lead to the unit operating ineffectively, wasting energy and increasing monthly bills. Such expenses can quickly add up, soon becoming an unwelcome burden on homeowners. It’s also worth noting that inefficient air conditioning can sometimes produce a harmful gas that has been known to cause headaches, dizziness, and even nausea.

When dealing with any matters pertaining to air conditioning, it’s best to utilize the services of a certified technician. The licensed technicians found in our directory of appliance repair technicians have the expertise to safely and efficiently service a multitude of AC models, thus preventing potential damage and costs that could result from improper installation.

## FAQ - Keeping Cool: A Look at the Dangers of Air Conditioning

1. **What are the health risks of air conditioning?**

Air conditioning can cause dehydration, eye and throat irritation, and worsen asthma and other respiratory conditions. By recirculating bacteria, fungi and dust mites, air conditioning can create an environment that contributes to discomfort and poor air quality. 

2. **Are there any other hazards associated with air conditioning?**

Yes, air conditioning systems may also introduce carbon dioxide into the air, which can have significant negative health effects. Additionally, evaporative cooling systems require regular maintenance or they can leak or overflow and cause property damage.

3. **How can the health risks associated with air conditioning be minimized?**

The health risks associated with air conditioning can be minimised by using a high quality air filter, regularly cleaning external and internal coils, regularly replacing the filter, and minimise the use of germicides, as these can add to air pollution. Additionally, using a dehumidifier can reduce the risk of condensation, which can lead to mould growth.

4. **What steps should be taken to avoid water-related damage?**

Regularly inspecting the air conditioning system and removing any blockages is key to avoiding water-related damage. Additionally, inspecting the drainage pipe to ensure it isn’t blocked and checking for leaks should also be done regularly.

5. **What other steps can be taken for safe operation of air conditioning systems?**

Regularly checking the temperature of the air coming from the vents is a must. Additionally, inspecting the drains and pipes regularly, and changing out any clogged filters is an important step to ensure the system functions optimally. It's also a good idea to have the system serviced by a qualified technician at least once a year.
