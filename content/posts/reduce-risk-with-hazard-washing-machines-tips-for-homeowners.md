## Reduce Risk from Hazard Washing Machines

Every homeowner faces the necessity of doing laundry to keep clothes clean and fresh, but the risk of a faulty washing machine can be worrisome. Being aware of the steps you can take to reduce the hazard is important to ensure safety in the home. Follow these tips to reduce the risk of a malfunctioning washing machine in your home.

It is important to ensure safety by being aware of any recalls of a particular washing machine model you have. By checking the United States Consumer Product Safety Commision recalls website you can stay informed and up to date on any recalls of the particular washing machine you own. In addition, if you have any concerns regarding a particular model, have it inspected by a professional technician who specializes in appliance repair.

To remain proactive, it is beneficial to establish consistent maintenance of your home appliance. This can be done by ensuring the hoses and connections remain in safe working condition, and that laundry detergent containers are frequently emptied and cleaned. Preventing any potential hazards can be done through regular cleanings using an approved cleaner, as this helps avoid dirt and detergent residue buildup which can be a potential fire hazard.

Additionally, when loading clothing, ensure the appliance is not overloaded. If a washer is overloaded, the unit can become off balance, leading to shaking and a possible malfunction. Ensure the clothing and items are evenly distributed in the washer to help keep the load balanced.

By following these steps, homeowners can reduce the risk of a hazard from their washing machine. Homeowners can increase their safety further by enlisting the help of a professional appliance repair technician when necessary to maintain their home appliance.
