From front-loading models to stackable units, these dryers are reliable and efficient, making them the perfect addition to your home. 

Whirlpool electric dryers are available in a range of sizes, from compact models designed for tight spaces, to larger capacity options for large families. These dryers are equipped with a variety of features to improve performance and efficiency, such as advanced sensors that detect the moisture levels in your laundry, and special cycles that minimize wrinkles. Many models feature steam assist. This function helps to reduce and relax wrinkles, as well as remove odors and reduce static cling. 

The interior drum of the Whirlpool electric dryer is made of stainless steel, making it more durable and resistant to rust and discolouration. This material is highly reflective, allowing clothes to be tumbled more efficiently. The lint filter is also made of stainless steel, making it easier to clean and more durable.

Whirlpool electric dryers come with a range of helpful features to ensure your laundry is properly dried and ready to go. An interior light, a child lock, and an end-of-cycle signal are included in many models. These features provide extra convenience and safety for families. In addition, the dryers come with Whirlpool’s 10-year limited parts warranty, giving you peace of mind.
