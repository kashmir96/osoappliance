When your dishwasher starts to smell unpleasant, it can be a sign that something is wrong with your appliance. There are a few common causes of dishwasher odors, and they can be easily addressed with some simple maintenance. 

The first cause of smelly dishwashers is poor drainage. If your dishwasher isn’t draining properly, the standing water in the bottom of the appliance will start to become stagnant and smelly. This can be caused by a clogged drain hose or pump filter. To fix this issue, you’ll need to clean out the drain hose and pump filter by hand. 

Another cause of bad odors in your dishwasher is mold or mildew growth. This can occur if you don’t run your dishwasher often enough, as moisture will build up in the appliance over time and create an ideal environment for mold and mildew growth. To prevent this from happening, make sure to run your dishwasher at least once a week even when it isn’t full of dishes. Additionally, clean out any standing water or food residue that is left behind after each cycle with a damp cloth or sponge. 

Finally, smelly odors can also come from food particles that have been left behind on dishes or stuck in crevices inside the dishwasher itself. To eliminate such odors, make sure to pre-scrub dishes before loading them into the machine and use an approved detergent designed for removing tough food residue from plates and utensils. Additionally, you may want to consider running an empty cycle with vinegar every few months to help remove any lingering food particles inside your machine. 

By following these tips and taking the time for regular maintenance on your appliance, you should be able to keep unpleasant smells away from your kitchen for good!
