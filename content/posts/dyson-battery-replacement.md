Dyson battery replacement is a process that allows you to replace the battery in your Dyson vacuum cleaner. The battery in a Dyson vacuum cleaner is a nickel-cadmium battery, and it is not rechargeable. Over time, the battery in a Dyson vacuum cleaner will lose its ability to hold a charge, and it will need to be replaced. 

The process of replacing the battery in a Dyson vacuum cleaner is fairly simple. 

To do so, follow these steps
1. Unplug the vacuum cleaner from the wall and remove the cover.
2. Locate the battery compartment and remove the old battery.
3. Insert the new battery into the compartment and make sure it is securely in place.
4. Replace the cover and plug the vacuum cleaner back into the wall to continue charging. 

Once the battery is replaced, you will need to charge it for 24 hours. Once it is charged, you can put the cover back on the vacuum cleaner and start using it.
