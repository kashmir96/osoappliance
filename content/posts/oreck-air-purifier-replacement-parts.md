If you’ve invested in an Oreck air purifier, you know the value of having clean and healthy air in your home. Over time, however, your Oreck purifier may need new parts to keep it running at its best. Replacing certain parts on an Oreck air purifier is easy to do and can ensure that your purifier is performing optimally. 

The most common replacement part for an Oreck air purifier is the filter. The filter serves as the “heart” of the machine and captures airborne particles that can make breathing difficult or unhealthy. Depending on how often you use your Oreck and how much dust, pollen, or other particles are circulating in the environment, filters should be replaced every 6-12 months. There are several types of filters available for Oreck machines; make sure that you choose the right one for your model number. 

Another frequent replacement part for an Oreck air purifier is a fan belt. The fan belt helps move air through the machine so that all of its components can work together efficiently. If your machine’s fan stops working or starts making strange noises, it may be time to replace its fan belt with a new one from Oreck’s website or local store location. 

Finally, some models also require periodic replacement of their carbon filters. Carbon filters are responsible for removing odors from the air and should be replaced every 1-2 years depending on usage levels and environmental conditions in your area. Be sure to check with an authorized dealer if you have any questions about which type of carbon filter is right for your model number before making a purchase online or at a local store location. 

Replacing certain parts on an Oreck air purifier requires knowledge of each individual model number – but doing so will ensure that it continues to provide clean and healthy air throughout your home!
