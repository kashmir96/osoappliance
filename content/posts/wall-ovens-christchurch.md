Are you considering buying a new oven for your kitchen but can’t decide between a wall oven and a free standing oven? Wall ovens in Christchurch are becoming increasingly popular due to their many benefits. Read on to find out why you should choose a wall oven over a free standing oven.

The most obvious advantage of having a wall oven is that it takes up much less space than a free standing oven. This allows you to gain more counter space in your kitchen, making it easier to move around and prepare meals. Wall ovens also come with more features and functions than free standing models, so if you like to cook complex dishes, then this could be an ideal choice for you. Additionally, some models come with an integrated range hood and additional cooking surfaces such as grills or hot plates which can be incredibly helpful when preparing multiple dishes at once. 

Wall ovens are also much more energy efficient than their free standing counterparts due to the fact that they heat up faster because of their smaller size. This means that your food will cook faster and use less electricity overall. Wall ovens also tend to have better insulation than free standing models, helping to keep heat inside the unit and preventing excessive heat from escaping into the room. 

Finally, wall ovens tend to be more aesthetically pleasing than other types of ovens as they can fit seamlessly into existing kitchen designs without creating an eyesore or taking up too much space. You can choose from various styles such as contemporary or traditional designs depending on your personal preference, making it easy to find one that suits the theme of your home perfectly. 

In conclusion, wall ovens in Christchurch are becoming increasingly popular due to their many benefits including taking up less space, having more features and functions, being energy efficient, and being aesthetically pleasing compared to other types of ovens. If you’re looking for a new cooker but aren’t sure what type would best suit your needs then consider opting for one of these versatile units - you won’t regret it!
