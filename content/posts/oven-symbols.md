Oven symbols can be confusing, especially when you're trying to make a perfect meal. Knowing what each symbol means can help you make sure your food comes out just the way you like it. 

The first important symbol is the one that looks like a fan. This indicates that the oven has a fan-assisted cooking setting. The fan helps to circulate heat around whatever is in the oven, meaning that food cooks evenly and more quickly than it would without it. 

The second symbol looks like two horizontal lines with an arrow pointing to them from either side. This indicates that there is a grill setting in the oven, which is great for making things like toast and bacon slices crispy on both sides at once! 

Another important symbol looks like a triangle inside of a circle with lines radiating outward from it; this indicates that the oven has an “eco” setting, which uses less energy than other settings and can save money on your electricity bills! 

The fourth symbol looks like two crossed lines inside of a square; this indicates that there is an upper and lower heating element in the oven, allowing you to cook different dishes at different temperatures simultaneously. 

Finally, there is usually one last symbol which looks like an hourglass with arrows pointing inwards or outwards from either side; this signifies whether or not there is an auto-shutoff feature available on the oven. If your oven has this feature then it will turn off automatically after a certain amount of time has passed since it was turned on, saving you energy and potentially preventing accidents caused by forgetting about food left in the oven for too long! 

Overall, understanding these symbols can help you get more out of your oven and make sure your meals turn out perfect every time.
