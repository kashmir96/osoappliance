## Broken Dryer Belts: What to Look For
With a busy lifestyle, it can be difficult to keep up with the maintenance of all your household appliances. If your dryer has been showing signs of trouble, it's important to pay attention to the signs of a broken dryer belt, and be sure to have it fixed or replaced as soon as possible.

The dryer belt connects the drum to the motor. It is responsible for transferring power from the motor to the drum, and it plays a huge role in achieving the spinning motion. It is likely that a noticeable sound or smell is the first symptom of dryer belt wear and tear. This can be loud squeaking or squealing, or an unusual smell coming from your dryer. Furthermore, your dryer may take longer to dry your clothes, and you may notice that they are not as warm when they come out of the machine.

If the belt is broken, it will cause your drum to become loose. When you remove the front panel, you should be able to see whether or not it is in good shape. The belt should be flat, rather than twisted or frayed.

In order to fix a broken dryer belt, you should hire an experienced appliance repair professional. This ensures that your dryer is repaired properly and safely.
