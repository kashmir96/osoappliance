## Diagnosing a Whirlpool Fridge Error Code

We all dread it - the dreaded error code! Having an error code displayed on your Whirlpool fridge can throw a wrench into your daily routine, not to mention costing you money. But don’t worry - troubleshooting a Whirlpool fridge error code can be easier than you think. With some simple steps, you’ll have the problem solved in no time.

First, take a look at the error code that appears on the display. All Whirlpool fridges have a unique alphanumeric code which can be used to diagnose the issue. This code provides a general indication of what the problem is and what part needs to be serviced. Refer to your owner’s manual to locate the code and its meaning.

If the error code isn’t clear, try unplugging the refrigerator and then plugging it back in to see if that fixes the problem. If not, the error code may be a result of a component, such as the condenser or evaporator fans, no longer functioning properly. In this case, you’ll need to contact a licensed Whirlpool service technician to inspect the parts and make any necessary repairs.

In some cases, the refrigerator’s temperature sensor may be to blame. This part sends signals to the refrigerator’s control board to adjust temperatures. To test the sensor, use a multimeter to measure the electrical resistance of the sensor. If the readings are outside the range specified in your owner’s manual, you’ll need to have the part replaced.

Finally, if the error code seems to be caused by a computer problem, Whirlpool fridges have a diagnostic testing mode. This mode allows you to input commands to the refrigerator’s computer to access potential faults or issues. You can typically enter the mode by pressing a combination of buttons on the control board. Your owner’s manual should explain the steps for activating diagnostic testing mode.

Diagnosing and repairing a Whirlpool fridge error code doesn’t have to be a daunting task. By following the steps outlined above, you can get your refrigerator back in working order in no time. If you’re ever unsure of the cause of the issue, refer to our comprehensive appliance error codes glossary for more information and tips on troubleshooting.
