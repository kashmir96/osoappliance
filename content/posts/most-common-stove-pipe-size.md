Stove pipe is the venting system used to connect a wood stove to the chimney. It is important to choose the correct size stove pipe for your setup, as it affects both the efficiency of the stove and safety. The most common sizes of stove pipe are 6” and 8”, although 5”, 10” and 12” are also available.

When choosing a size for your stove pipe, it is important to consider both its diameter and length. The diameter should be determined by the size of your flue collar on your wood or pellet burning appliance; if you have a 6-inch flue collar then you should use 6-inch stove pipe. If you have an 8-inch flue collar then you should use 8-inch stove pipe. It is also important to consider how long each section of your venting system will be; if there are several feet between each joint then it may be beneficial to use larger diameter pipes in order to reduce restriction in airflow. 

The material used for stove pipes also plays an important role in their performance; steel is generally more durable than aluminum, but can rust over time while aluminum will not rust but can dent easily when bumped or moved around during installation or cleaning. Aluminum allows fire from the interior walls of chimneys to pass through more easily than steel, so is typically recommended for longer runs or systems with bends or turns in them as this will help keep airflow unobstructed and increase efficiency. 

In addition to these considerations, there are various types of fittings that must be purchased separately which attach directly onto the ends of the pipes like elbows (for turns) and tees (for connections). Each fitting must match up with its corresponding sectional piece so make sure all measurements match before purchasing any individual components! 

Ultimately it is best practice when installing a wood burning appliance such as a furnace or fireplace insert that all measurements be double checked before purchase so that everything fits correctly once installed; this way any issues with improper sizing can be avoided from start finish!
