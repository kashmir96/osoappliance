## Knowing Why Error Codes Occur Helps Troubleshoot Washer Issues

If you are a general consumer and user of household appliances, you likely depend on your washing machine to keep your clothes clean. However, it may seem disheartening when you encounter error codes on your washer. It is important to understand what your washer's error codes mean in order to troubleshoot the issue correctly.

Error codes can show up on your washer for several reasons. They can indicate a mechanical fault, an electronic malfunction, or the machine simply needs maintenance, such as emptying out the lint filter. An error code could also indicate a problem with the electrical connection, such as a power out. Less often, the code could point to an issue with the installation, such as a voltage that's too high or too low.

Fortunately, most current make and model machines have error code displays that include a number or letter code. This allows you to quickly identify the issue. You can always look up the error code online in the owner's manual or contact the manufacturer for assistance. It is important to always check the error code first, as this will give you a better idea of the cause and can potentially save you time and money when you understand what it is telling you.

Error code troubleshooting is the best way to diagnose and solve any issue with your washer. By understanding why error codes occur and what they mean, you can take the proper steps to repair your machine. This will help keep your washer running smoothly for years to come.
