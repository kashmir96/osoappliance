If your dishwasher isn't getting water, it could be a sign of a few different problems. To help you identify the issue and get your dishwasher running again, here are some common causes and solutions for why your dishwasher can’t get water. 

1. Clogged or frozen water line: If the water line that supplies the dishwasher is clogged or frozen, it won’t be able to get the water it needs to operate properly. To fix this issue, you’ll need to thaw out the line or clear away any clogs. 

2. Broken fill valve: The fill valve is responsible for allowing water into the dishwasher. If it’s broken or malfunctioning, it won’t be able to do its job correctly. In this case, you’ll need to replace the fill valve with a new one. 

3. Blocked drain hose: The drain hose is what carries dirty water out of the dishwasher and into the sink or garbage disposal. If it’s blocked by debris or food particles, it won’t be able to do its job correctly and will prevent fresh water from entering the dishwasher. To fix this issue, you’ll need to clear away any blockages in the drain hose. 

4. Low water pressure: Low water pressure can prevent your dishwasher from getting enough water to operate properly. To fix this issue, you may need to adjust the pressure regulator on your home's main water supply line or contact a plumber for assistance. 

5. Blocked inlet valve: The inlet valve is responsible for controlling the flow of water into the dishwasher. If it’s blocked or clogged, it won’t be able to do its job correctly and will prevent water from entering the dishwasher. To fix this issue, you’ll need to clean or replace the inlet valve. 

6. Faulty timer: The timer controls when water enters the dishwasher, so if it’s faulty or malfunctioning, it may not be allowing water into the dishwasher at all. In this case, you’ll need to replace the timer with a new one.

7. The tap is turned off: It may sound simple, but it’s easy to forget to turn on the tap before running the dishwasher. Make sure that the tap is turned on and that you have adequate water pressure in order for your dishwasher to get enough water. 

If none of these solutions work, then you may have an underlying issue with your dishwasher that needs professional attention. In this case, contact an appliance repair technician for assistance in diagnosing and fixing your dishwasher's issue so that it can start getting water again!
