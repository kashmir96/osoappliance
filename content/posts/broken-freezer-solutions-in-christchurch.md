## VI. Navigating Food Safety in a Broken Freezer in Christchurch

### A. The Risks of Thawed and Refrozen Food in a Broken Freezer
A broken freezer can pose a significant threat to the safety of your food. When the temperature of the freezer rises, food can thaw and then refreeze. When this happens, it can cause the texture and flavor of the food to change, making it unsafe to eat.

### B. Which Foods Can and Cannot be Refrozen After Thawing
Not all foods are safe to refreeze after thawing. Perishable items like raw meats, dairy products, and some cooked foods should not be refrozen as it can increase the risk of foodborne illness. On the other hand, items such as fruits and vegetables, bread, and pastries can usually be refrozen with no ill effects.

### C. Identifying Defrosted and Refrozen Food in Your Freezer
It can be difficult to determine if food has defrosted and refrozen in a broken freezer. Signs of this can include a change in the texture and color of the food, as well as the presence of ice crystals. If you suspect that food in your freezer has defrosted and refrozen, it is best to err on the side of caution and throw it away.
