When it comes to boiling water, there is a key difference between a jug and a kettle. A jug is generally used to pour hot water into cups or containers, while a kettle is designed to boil water and can be used to make things like tea or coffee.

Jugs usually don’t have an electric element, so the water needs to be heated on the stove or in the microwave before it can be poured into cups. Jugs come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from large ones for bigger families or gatherings, right down to individual-sized jugs that are perfect for single servings.

Kettles, on the other hand, are designed with an electric element which heats up quickly and efficiently - they’re best suited for boiling water quickly when you need drinks ready fast! Kettles come in many different styles too - some have clear plastic bodies so you can monitor the level of water inside them (ideal for people who prefer weaker tea!) and some even have built-in filters so you don’t get any limescale deposits clogging up your drink. 

Overall, jugs are great for pouring hot liquid into cups or containers while kettles are perfect for speedily boiling larger amounts of water when making drinks such as tea and coffee.
