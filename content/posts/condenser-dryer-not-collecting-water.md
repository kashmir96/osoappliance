When you're trying to dry your laundry, the last thing you want is for the condenser dryer not to collect water. But unfortunately, this is a common problem. So what causes it, and what can you do about it?

The main reason why a condenser dryer may not be collecting water is because the condenser itself is blocked or clogged. This could be caused by lint that has built up over time, or it could be due to dirt and debris that has collected in the condenser unit. In either case, the result is that the water won’t be able to flow through the condenser, and the dryer won’t be able to do its job.

The first thing you should do if you’re having this issue is to try and clean out the condenser. Unplug the dryer and remove the lint filter. Then, use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to try and remove any lint or debris from the condenser. If this doesn’t solve the issue, you may need to replace the condenser.

Another possible cause of a condenser dryer not collecting water is a clogged drain hose. This can happen if lint or debris has built up in the hose, which will prevent the water from draining properly. To fix this problem, you can try using a flexible brush to clean out the hose. If this doesn’t work, you may need to replace the drain hose.

Finally, the last possible cause of a condenser dryer not collecting water is a faulty drain pump. If the pump is not working correctly, then the water won’t be able to flow through the condenser as it should. To fix this problem, you will need to replace the pump–if you're not an avid DIYer it's recommended you get an expert, dealing with electrical equipment is dangerous and could put yourself, the dryer and your entire house at risk.

If your condenser dryer is not collecting water, then these are the most likely causes. The best thing you can do is to try and clean out the condenser, check the drain hose for any clogs, and replace the pump if necessary. If you’re still having issues, then you may need to call in a professional repair service.
