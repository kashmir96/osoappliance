Rice cookers are an incredibly useful kitchen tool for making perfectly cooked rice that doesn't require constant stirring or checking. A rice cooker is an electric appliance that is designed to cook white and/or brown rice at the press of a button. Rice cookers are popular because they make it easy to prepare a variety of dishes in one pot, freeing you up to do other tasks while dinner cooks.

When shopping for a rice cooker, there are several features you should consider in order to find the right one for your needs. The two most common types of rice cookers are traditional and advanced models, each with its own unique set of features. Traditional models are basic and usually come with simple on/off buttons as well as settings for cooking plain white or brown rice. Advanced models usually come with additional features such as timers, multiple cooking settings, steam baskets or trays, and even warming modes so food stays hot until it's ready to be served.

Another important feature to consider is the size of the cooker; larger ones can hold up to 10 cups of uncooked white or brown rice, while smaller ones may only hold four cups at a time. Consider how much food you typically need when cooking for your family; if you never need more than four cups at once then a smaller model might be sufficient but if you're often making larger portions then opting for a larger model would be wise. 

In terms of price range, basic models start around $50 but can go up depending on the brand name and additional features included with the cooker. Higher-end options typically run closer to $200 but often include advanced features like slow-cooking modes or pressure-cooking capabilities which can be great if you want something more versatile than just cooking plain white or brown rice. 

Overall, choosing the right type of rice cooker depends largely on what type of dishes you plan on preparing and how much food you'll need on hand when feeding your family; however regardless what kind you wind up choosing they all make it easier than ever before to prepare delicious meals without having to constantly stir or check on them while theyâ€™re cooking!
