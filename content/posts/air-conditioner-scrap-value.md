In today's world, air conditioners are a popular home appliance. But what happens when it’s time to replace your old air conditioner? You may be wondering what the scrap value is for an air conditioner. 

Scrap value refers to the amount of money that can be earned from selling an old item rather than disposing of it. This scrap value is determined by factoring in the age and condition of the item, as well as current market conditions and demand for similar items. 

When looking at air conditioners, there are several factors that will affect their scrap value: 
1) Age: Older AC units tend to have a lower scrap value due to their age and lack of efficiency compared to newer models. 
2) Condition: Air conditioners in good working order will have a higher scrap value than those that need major repairs or are completely broken down. 
3) Type: Central AC units tend to have a higher scrap value than window units or portable ACs due to their larger size and greater potential for reuse or recycling parts. 
4) Brand: Certain brands of AC units are more popular than others, so these will often fetch a higher price on the secondary market when sold as scrapped items. 
5) Current Market Conditions: The current demand for similar items on the secondary market will also determine how much an old AC unit can fetch in terms of its scrap value. If there is high demand for certain types of refurbished parts then this could increase the overall price you can get for your scrapped air conditioner unit. 

Overall, it’s difficult to estimate exactly how much money you could get from scrapping your old air conditioner without first assessing its age, type, brand and current market conditions; however, most people should expect to get between $30-$100 depending on all these factors mentioned above.
