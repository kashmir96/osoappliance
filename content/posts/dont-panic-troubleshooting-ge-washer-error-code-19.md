## Troubleshooting Error Code 19 in a GE Washer
Having an issue with your washing machine can be a stressful experience. In order to remain calm and assured, it's important to know what to do if you come across an error code. This blog post will explain error code 19 in GE washers, what to do if you come across it, and offer helpful resources. 

Error code 19 means the control is unable to detect the motorâ€™s speed. This can be due to the motor or control being faulty, the connections to the motor and control being loose, blocked items in the washer drum, and/or the drive belt being worn or broken.

The first step to troubleshooting this issue is to unplug the washer from the power source. Once unplugged, inspect the connections to and from the motor and the control for any loose connections. If the connections are secure, inspect the drive belt for any signs of wear or breakage.

Next, inspect inside the washer drum for any items that may be blocking the movement of the drum. This could be caused by items that are still within the washer drum after a cycle, a broken agitator, or any other item that could be getting in the way. 

If none of these remedies solve your issue, there may be an error with the motor or the control, in which case you will be required to contact a professional repair technician to diagnose and repair the issue.

If you are experiencing an issue with your GE washer, we suggest using error code 19 as a guide to troubleshoot and inspect basic issues before contacting an appliance repair technician.
