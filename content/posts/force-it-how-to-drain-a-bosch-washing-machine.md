## Easily Drain a Bosch Washing Machine
When dealing with a Bosch washing machine, it can be a tricky process to drain it—but it doesn't have to be! With our step-by-step guide, you can quickly and easily drain a Bosch washing machine.

First and foremost, always make sure your machine is unplugged and the water turned off. Then, use a flat-head screwdriver to remove the pump filter cap and place a bucket or bowl under the filter to collect the water and debris. Hold the filter and use the screwdriver to turn and open the drain hose clamp. Insert the hose into the bowl and then start the emptying process.

Next, look closely at the back of the machine and locate the drain hose, the electric cable and the drain pump. Detach the drain pump outlet hose from the back of the machine, then take pliers and remove the clamp securing the drain pump outlet hose to the drain pipe. Using a wrench, unscrew the clamp and carefully remove the pump and motor assembly. Be sure to place a bucket below the pump to catch any dripping water and lift the pump assembly away. 

The last step is to unscrew the drain pipe valve and return the drain pump to its original position. Close the clamp over the drain hose and secure the cable, then re-attach the drain hose to the back of the machine and check for any water leakage. Once everything is secure, it's safe to turn the water and power back on.

Draining a Bosch washing machine can be a frustrating task for many.
