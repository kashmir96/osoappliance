Do you have a loud dryer that suddenly stops? This is a common problem and can be caused by several different factors. In this blog, we’ll discuss what could be causing your dryer to make loud noises then stop, as well as ways you can try to fix it yourself before contacting a repair service.

The most likely cause of your dryer making loud noises then stopping is an issue with the motor bearings or belt. When the motor bearings become worn down or the belt starts slipping, they will create a louder-than-normal noise followed by the machine ceasing to operate. If this is the case, you won’t be able to fix it yourself and will need to contact a repair service for assistance.

If you’re familiar with how your dryer works, another possible cause could be lint buildup in the drum or venting system. This often happens when people forget to clean their lint filter regularly and can cause loud noises while also reducing drying efficiency. To address this issue, start by cleaning out all of the lint from around your drum and filter using a vacuum cleaner attachment or any other suction tool available. Afterward, disconnect your venting hose from where it connects behind the machine and use either a vacuum cleaner attachment or shop vac to suck out all of the debris inside before reconnecting everything back together again properly. 
 
If neither of these solutions seem applicable based on what you experience with your dryer, then there may very well be another underlying issue at play that needs professional attention from someone trained in appliance repair services like an electrician or HVAC technician. But if not addressed soon enough, this could potentially lead to more expensive problems down the line so it’s highly advised that you contact one as soon as possible for help resolving whatever is causing these issues with your machine!
