Are washing machines safe to use? The answer is a resounding yes! Modern washing machines are designed with your safety in mind, and have features that prevent injury and minimize the risk of accidents.

The first measure of safety built into most washing machines is a lid lock. This feature prevents the lid from opening while the machine is running, eliminating the risk of getting an arm or hand caught inside. Most washers also have an overload detector that shuts off power to the motor if too much laundry is put in at once, protecting both you and your machine from damage.

Modern washing machines also come equipped with temperature controls to ensure your clothes are washed in water that won’t scald skin or damage delicate fabrics. To further protect you and your family, many washers now come with a child safety lock feature to keep curious fingers out of harm’s way.

Overall, modern washing machines are designed for maximum safety. If you choose one with extra features such as an auto shut-off timer or low-water warning alert, you can enjoy even greater peace of mind when using it around small children or pets.
