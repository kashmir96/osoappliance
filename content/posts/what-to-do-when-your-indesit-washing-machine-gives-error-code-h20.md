## Dealing with an Indesit Washing Machine Error Code H20
For general consumers and users of household appliances, error codes issued on machines such as washing machines can be intimidating. Error code H20 on Indesit washing machines is no exception. While it's important to understand the issue and have a plan for resolution, fear not - help is at hand. 

The first step to resolving error code H20 is to identify the likely cause. Common causes include excess detergent trapped in the filter or water pressure problems. A thorough inspection of the filter by unclogging if required should be the first step. Ensuring that the tap or water source is adequately supplying water to the machine is also of utmost importance, as this is a primary indicator of this issue.

Should you be uncomfortable completing either of these steps, it is recommended that you contact a qualified technician. There may also be other causes that only a technician will be able to identify, such as misalignment of internal parts or defective valves. 

It's worth mentioning that error codes on washing machines are quite common and rarely are a cause for concern. They indicate a potential or current issue, which is easy enough to diagnose and treat.
