If you think you have a gas leak in your stove, it is important to take action quickly. Gas leaks can be dangerous, so it is important to call the right people to check and make sure that your home is safe.

The first thing you should do when you suspect a gas leak in your stove is to turn off the gas supply. This will prevent any further gas from leaking out and potentially causing harm. Once the gas supply has been shut off, you should call your local fire department or emergency services immediately. They will be able to send out a professional who can inspect the stove and make sure that there is no danger present.

If it turns out that there is a gas leak, the fire department or emergency services can help you determine what steps need to be taken next. Depending on the severity of the leak, they may recommend calling a professional plumber or HVAC technician who specializes in dealing with gas leaks. The technician will be able to identify the source of the leak and repair or replace any faulty parts that are causing it. 

In some cases, it may be necessary for the technician to shut off the main gas line to your home until the repair is complete. If this is necessary, they will also provide instructions on how to safely turn it back on once repairs are finished. 

No matter what type of gas leak you may have in your stove, it is important to take action right away and call for help if needed. If left unchecked, a gas leak can cause serious health problems as well as damage to your home and belongings.
