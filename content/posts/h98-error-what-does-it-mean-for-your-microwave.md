## What Does H98 Error Code Mean for Your Microwave?
Are you getting an H98 error code on your microwave? If so, then you probably have some questions about what it is, why it happened, and what you should do about it. Let's take a look at what an H98 error code is and how it affects your microwave.

An H98 error code is an indication of a low voltage supply. This can be caused by a variety of things, such as a degraded power cord, a blocked ventilation system, a malfunctioning fan motor, or a tripped circuit breaker. It is an indication that your microwave is not receiving the correct amount of power supply to function properly.

If you are getting an H98 error code, the first step should be to unplug your microwave and confirm the power cord is securely connected to both the outlet and the appliance. If the cord looks damaged in any way, then it should be replaced. If everything looks okay, then you should check the ventilation system. Make sure there is nothing blocking the ventilation and that fans are still functioning correctly. If this does not address the H98 error code, then it is time to call a professional. They can inspect the interior of your microwave to look for any malfunctions.

In general, an H98 error code is not a major issue and is easily addressed with a quick check of the power cord, ventilation system, and fan motors. If the H98 error code persists, then it is best to call a professional to inspect your appliance and provide the necessary repairs or maintenance to get it working properly again.
