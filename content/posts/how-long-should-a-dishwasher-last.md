# How long should a dishwasher last

When it comes to household appliances, particularly those in the kitchen, a dishwasher is one appliance you don’t want to be without for very long. But how long does a dishwasher typically last? 

Generally speaking, most dishwashers will last about 10 years before needing to be replaced. However, this could be longer or shorter depending on several factors including the amount of use and maintenance done on it throughout its lifetime. 

At the end of its life cycle, many dishwashers start showing signs that they may need replacing soon such as leaking water, unable to fill with water properly, not draining properly or making strange noises while in operation. If any of these issues occur and you’ve had your dishwasher for more than eight years then it might be time to consider replacing it with a new one. 

To help increase the longevity of your existing dishwasher and get the most out of it while it lasts, there are several maintenance tips you can apply: 

  • Check and clean out any food particles that may have become lodged in the filter after each use. This will help reduce clogging and other potential issues that can arise over time.

  • Fill your sink with hot soapy water before starting your washing cycle so that dishes have less soil for your machine to clean off them when running.

  • Run an empty cycle at least once every two months using an all-in-one detergent tablet or powder detergent along with vinegar rinse aid which will help keep your machine free from limescale build-up and mineral deposits that can shorten its lifespan over time if left unchecked.

  • Be sure not to overload your machine as this can cause significant damage due to strain put on certain components during operation which can lead to costly repairs or even replacement down the line if not addressed quickly enough.

In conclusion, following these tips along with proper usage should help give you around 10 years worth of use from your existing dishwasher before needing a replacement but keep in mind results may vary depending on how well maintained yours is throughout its lifetime as well!
