In today’s world, blenders are an essential part of any kitchen. Whether you’re making a smoothie, milkshake, or soup, having a reliable blender is key to making all your favorite recipes. But if you’re on a budget, finding a quality blender that won’t break the bank can be difficult. Fortunately, there are plenty of great options available for under $100. Here’s what to look for when shopping for the best blender under $100.

First and foremost, consider your needs before making a purchase. There are hundreds of different blenders available at various price points and each one has its own features and capabilities. If you only plan on using it occasionally then maybe all you need is something basic like an immersion blender or personal-sized model with few bells and whistles that can easily fit in your cupboard or drawer when not in use. On the other hand, if you want something more powerful that can handle larger batches and tougher ingredients then it might be worth investing in a full-sized countertop model with more power and settings such as pre-programmed settings for specific tasks like ice crushing or smoothie blending.

Next, look at what type of motor powers each model – some will have motors rated by wattage while others may use amps instead so make sure to compare those numbers to get an idea of their power levels relative to each other.. Additionally pay attention to the blade material – stainless steel blades tend to hold up better over time compared with plastic blades which may dull quicker after heavy usage so decide which type best fits your needs before purchasing one particular model over another.. Finally think about accessories such as additional pitchers or cups - many models come with these included but some don't so make sure these items are included if they're important for your specific blending needs!

By taking into account these factors plus any additional features such as warranty length or ease-of-use settings like preprogrammed buttons for specific tasks (like ice crushing), you'll be able to find the perfect blender under $100 that fits both your budget and lifestyle!
