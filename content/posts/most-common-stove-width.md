When it comes to finding the right stove for your kitchen, size really does matter. Stove width is an important factor to consider to ensure your kitchen has enough space for cooking and ventilation. It’s important to measure the size of your existing stove or the space you’re planning on placing a new one before you start shopping. Here’s a quick guide on the most common stove widths available. 

Standard-width stoves are typically between 24 and 30 inches wide, making them ideal for most kitchens with standard countertop sizes. If you have a smaller kitchen or limited countertop space, then a 20-inch gas or electric range might be more suitable for your needs. These types of stoves can also be great options if you don’t cook large meals very often, as they offer ample cooking space but don’t take up too much room in smaller kitchens. 

For those who prefer larger cooktops, there are 36 inch ranges that offer plenty of cooking power and surface area without taking up too much room in larger kitchens or open floor plans. If you need even more cooking power than what these models offer, double oven ranges come in sizes ranging from 30 inches all the way up to 48 inches wide! These double oven ranges give you plenty of options when it comes to different types of food preparation and can really help streamline mealtime when entertaining guests. 

Finally, if your kitchen has a professional chef-style layout then there are even pro-style ranges that come in sizes ranging from 36 to 60 inches wide! These extra wide professional grade models offer an incredible amount of power and control over what is cooked on them – perfect for serious home chefs who like to get creative with their menus! 

No matter what type of stove width works best for your particular kitchen needs, make sure you measure carefully before purchasing any appliance so that it will fit perfectly into its designated spot in your home!
