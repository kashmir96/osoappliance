## Understanding Precious Metals in Appliances 

These days, you rely on appliances more than ever. From washers and dryers to microwaves, toasters, and electric kettles, you've come to depend on them to make daily life more convenient. Despite all their overwhelming convenience, some of these appliances contain precious metals and alloys, which you may have not even known about. 

Modern-day appliances are often crafted with some highly reflective and valuable metals. Knowing what metals are in each appliance can become a great advantage to you, as many of these metals can be recycled and reused. This means that when you upgrade your appliance, you can recycle the old one and get some money back. Additionally, knowing what metals are in your appliance can help you attain a better understanding of your appliance’s potential.

Lead is often used as an alloy in a variety of metals, and can usually be found in the contact points and switches of your appliances. Copper is a highly malleable and ductile metal, meaning that it can often be found in the induction coils, some heating elements and other such mechanisms. Additionally, nickel and chromium are often found in appliances such as toasters and coffee makers, due to their high heat resistance. 

Many high-end refrigerators and dishwashers contain platinum. Platinum is incredibly resilient and is often found in the circuitry, switches and heating elements. Gold is also used for its highly conductive properties and its incredible corrosion resistance.

 To know more about what precious metals are used in your appliances, it’s best to refer to your appliance’s manual before attempting to salvage it or recycle it yourself. Recycling centers will also have professionals who can carefully approach the recycling process.

Recycling and reusing the precious metals found in appliances is a great way to make the most out of your upgrades. Knowing what metals are found in your appliances can help you gain a greater understanding of their value and potential. Take the time to refer to your appliance's manual and use the resources available to investigate the true value of your appliances.
