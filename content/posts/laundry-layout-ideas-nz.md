Are you looking to make the most of your laundry layout? With so many appliances and accessories to fit into a small space, it can be tricky to get the most out of your laundry. Here are some ideas that will help you create an efficient and effective design.

First, think about storage solutions. Many people find that installing shelves and wall-mounted cabinets or cupboards is a great way to store detergents, clothes hangers, ironing boards, and other essential items in the laundry room. This helps keep things neat and tidy as well as gives you more space for appliances like washers and dryers. You can also install drawers for easy access to clothes pegs, lint rollers, fabric softeners and other cleaning supplies. 

Second, consider the type of washing machine or dryer you want in your laundry space. If you’re looking for efficiency choose a front-loading model which uses less water than top-loading machines. Additionally if space is limited opt for a slimline model that fits into tight spaces such as under counters or between appliances. 

Thirdly plan where all your electrical connections need to go in order to power up all the necessary appliances. Make sure they are accessible but not visible – consider running them through walls or above skirting boards rather than having cables visible around the room! 

Lastly think about how much natural light enters your laundry room – this will help brighten up what could otherwise be quite an oppressive space! Consider adding windows or glass doors if possible (don’t forget blinds/curtains). And finally make sure all surfaces are easy to clean – tile floors with grout lines are often ideal as they are robust but also easy on maintenance! 

Hopefully these tips help when it comes time for planning out your perfect laundry layout!
