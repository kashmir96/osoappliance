## Get to the Bottom of Dyson Air Purifier Error Codes
Do you want to understand what your Dyson Air Purifier Display Symbols are telling you? Knowing how to troubleshoot these codes is important in order to properly care for your air purifier. In an effort to better understand your air purifier, let’s take a deep dive into the common codes and symbology. 

As a note of clarification, different types of air purifiers come with their own language. For instance, a HEPA air purifier has a different set of terms and codes than a UV air purifier. That being said, if your product has a filter indicator light and/or a ‘Clean Me’ indicator, the light is either telling you it needs attention, or the filter needs to be changed. 

Let’s start with a few of the most common codes: 
- if you see a single blinking light, this means it’s time to replace the filter, 
- if you see flashing lights in pairs, this may mean that your machine needs to be reset or that the motor needs to be checked 
- additionally, if you see a steady light with no sign of activity, this typically means that the filter on your device may be blocked, and your machine needs services. 

If you find that none of these codes apply to the flashing symbol on your air purifier, you should consult your user manual for further details. You’ll want to refer to the troubleshooting section, or the indicator codes section, for additional information. 

If you’re still having a difficult time solving your error code, you should call an appliance repair technician in your area. An experienced repair technician can assess the root cause of your error and provide a more informed diagnosis. A certified technician makes all the difference when it comes to repairing your appliances. With the help of a professional, you can ensure that all of your household appliances are in safe, working order.

When it comes to understanding the error display of your Dyson Air Purifier, it’s always best to refer to the user manual for specific codes. Additionally, with the help of a knowledgeable appliance repair technician, you can get the service and support you need to ensure a proper diagnosis and safe, secure repair. Contact a repair technician through our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians and take the first step towards solving the error code of your air purifier.
