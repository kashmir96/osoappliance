# How to stop a fridge freezing food

If you’ve noticed that your fridge is freezing your food, then you’re probably looking for a way to stop it. Fortunately, this is a relatively easy problem to fix. Here’s what you need to do:

1. Check the temperature setting. The first thing you should do is check the temperature setting on your fridge. If it’s set too low, then it could be causing the food to freeze. Try increasing the temperature a few degrees and see if that helps.

2. Clean the condenser coils. If the temperature setting is correct, then you should check the condenser coils. These coils can get clogged with dust and debris, which can cause the fridge to run too cold. Clean the coils with a vacuum cleaner or a brush to remove any build-up.

3. Check the door seals. If the condenser coils are clean, then you should check the door seals. If the seals are not sealing properly, then cold air can escape, causing the fridge to run too cold. Check the seals for any cracks or gaps and replace them if necessary.

4. Check the fan. The fan in the fridge helps to circulate the cold air and keep the temperature even. If the fan is not working properly, then it could be causing the food to freeze. Check the fan for any blockages or damage and replace it if necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to stop your fridge from freezing your food. If you’re still having problems, then you may need to call in a professional to take a look.
