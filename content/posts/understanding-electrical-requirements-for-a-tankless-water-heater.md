## Understanding Electrical Requirements for a Tankless Water Heater
Tankless water heaters offer several advantages, such as not having to store a large tank of hot water, saving energy and space. To benefit from a tankless water heater, it's important to understand the electrical requirements that go along with it. 

The most important factor to consider when determining the correct electrical requirements for a tankless water heater is the electrical output rated in watts or amps. The electrical output of the tankless water heater should be equal to or higher than the total wattage used by all of the items that will draw power from it. To ensure a safe and efficient operation of your tankless heater, the wattage rating should be considered and the water heater should be installed by a certified electrician. 

In order for electric tankless water heaters to work, there needs to be a dedicated power supply large enough to handle the electrical usage of the heater. Electric tankless water heaters generally require their own electric sub panel, and the power supply should be a minimum of 30 amps per breaker. It's important to note that the electric tankless water heater requires more power than a standard electric water heater. 

Electric tankless water heaters can be powered by either 240v or 120v. Most tankless water heaters are powered by a dedicated 240v power source but some may require 120v. Check the manufacturer's instructions before determining the correct voltage you will need. 

When considering an electric tankless water heater, it's important to make sure that you have the correct electrical requirements in place. It's recommended to have a qualified electrician check the power supply before installing the tankless water heater to ensure it meets all requirements. Having the necessary power supply and meeting all electrical requirements will guarantee that you get the most out of your tankless water heater.

Ultimately, electric tankless water heaters offer many advantages when it comes to energy savings, as well as not having to worry about running out of hot water. To ensure that you get the most out of your tankless water heater and benefit from the advantages it offers, it's important to consider and understand the electrical requirements that come with it.
