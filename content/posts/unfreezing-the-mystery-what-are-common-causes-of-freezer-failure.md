## Unraveling the Mystery of Freezer Failure
For those of us relying on the convenience of our freezer, it can be an unwelcome surprise when there is an unanticipated hiccup! Before you suffer through a headache-inducing attempt to diagnose your issue, our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary can be a great tool to help provide insight. The reality is, there are several common causes of freezer failure.

The most common issues are related to the compressor, power supply, defrost system, and the temperature control. The compressor is the engine of the freezer and its job is to pressurize the refrigerant, which moves through the ventilation system of the freezer and ensures even cooling. Issues with the compressor, therefore, can lead to a freezer that isn’t cooling properly.

Power supply could be another culprit of freezer failure. Because freezers use so much electricity, they often have dedicated power circuits in order to handle the power load. If your freezer has a power issue, there could be a problem with the wiring, the breaker, or the outlet. An electrician will be able to help you troubleshoot and find the issue.

The defrost system can fail due to components, such as the terminal board, the defrost timer, the heater and thermostat, heating up too slowly or not heating up at all and ice then builds up on the evaporator coils leading to reduced air flow and inefficient cooling.

The temperature control may also be a reason for the freezer not doing its job. This device regulates the temperature in the freezer and it could be malfunctioning due to improper calibration, a broken thermostat, or a short circuit.

Finally, while relatively rare, compressor burnout can occur due to old age, coolant leaks, or a failing electronic control board. Dedicated appliance technicians are best suited to help diagnose and repair any of these issues.

It’s understandable that when encountering freezer failure, tackling the problem can be overwhelming. Taking a look at the Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary and understanding the most common causes of freezer failure can be a great place to start. If any of the troubleshooting tips haven’t worked, a certified technician will be able to walk you through your issue and perform any repairs that are necessary.
