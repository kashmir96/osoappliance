## Proper Disposal Tips for an Old Refrigerator
A refrigerator is one of the largest, most expensive, and most important appliances in the home. To ensure it doesn't become an environmental hazard, proper disposal must be done when it's time to say goodbye. Here are some free tips on how to go about properly disposing of your refrigerator. 

The first step is to disconnect the refrigerator and remove any detachable shelving and drawers. Once disconnected and emptied, you should clean the inside with a mild soap (baking soda is a great option) and a large sponge. Make sure to remove stickers, tape and other adhesives. 

Next, it's time to remove the doors and seals. If the seals are still in good shape, you can usually donate them to an appliance repair outlet. Additionally, the doors must be taped shut to make sure they don't open during transit. Once the refrigerator is prepped, be sure to check with local authorities, as there often are city-specific requirements for proper disposal.

If you are looking to recycle the refrigerator, your local waste management or recycling center should be able to assist you. Depending on the age and condition of your fridge, some centers will even pick it up for free. The appliance will be taken specifically to a location that recycles large appliances, such as the metal parts and refrigerant gas, safely and properly. 

Lastly, if the appliance is still in good condition, you can donate it to local charitable organizations. Non-profit thrift stores or shelters occasionally receive donations of large appliances that still work; donating or giving away an old refrigerator helps those in need and keeps it out of a landfill. 

Disposing of a refrigerator properly can be a time-consuming and expensive process. Still, it's important to actively seek out the right avenues of recycling or disposal to make sure the appliance doesn't become hazardous waste.
