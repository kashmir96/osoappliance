## Unfamiliar Odor Coming From Oven?

A gas smell coming from the oven can be concerning, especially if it is unfamiliar. Many gas ovens and stoves have a smell to them, but this smell should be mild and only present when first turned on. An unusual smell coming from the oven can indicate a potentially serious issue.

### Possible Causes of Unfamiliar Smell
The most common cause of the gas smell from your oven is an issue with the gas lines. These lines, like all plumbing and electrical, can begin to wear over time, which can develop leaks. Another issue that can cause a gas smell is an issue with the pilot light. If the pilot light is extinguished, it can start to emit an odor similar to that of natural gas. Finally, another potential cause of a strong and peculiar smell coming from your oven is a faulty appliance part.

### What To Do
First and foremost, if you are concerned, shut off your gas and contact a gas appliances specialist or certified appliance repair technician. Itâ€™s important to take action if you are worried about potential danger associated with the gas smell. Further, you may wish to invest in yearly safety checks on your gas appliances in order to help minimize the risk of any dangerous situation arising.

Overall, concerning odors coming from your oven is not something to take lightly. It can potentially be an indication of a more serious issue. Taking proactive measures, such as scheduling yearly safety checks, can help to reduce any potential risks. If you believe there is a gas leak or an issue with your oven, contact a certified [Appliance Repair Technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) from our directory today.
