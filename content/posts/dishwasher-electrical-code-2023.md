The electrical code for dishwashers has been revised in 2021 and is now referred to as the 2021 National Electrical Code (NEC). This revision is important because it addresses safety guidelines specific to the installation of dishwashers. The NEC outlines two main requirements when it comes to wiring a dishwasher: installing a proper ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) and ensuring that the electrical box has enough space for all of the necessary wiring.

The NEC requires that all outlets within 6 feet of a sink must be GFCI protected. This means that, if an outlet near your sink does not have GFCI protection, you should install one before using your dishwasher. Furthermore, GFCIs must be tested to ensure proper operation at least once per month.

The NEC also requires that all electrical boxes used for installing a dishwasher must have sufficient space for all necessary wiring. This includes a minimum of 14 ½ inches in width and depth, along with 12 inches in height from top to bottom. Additionally, any additional wires or components installed inside the electrical box need their own separate space as well. It’s important to note that this requirement only applies to new installations – existing installations are exempt from this rule unless they are being modified or renovated in some way. 

Finally, it’s important that you make sure you hire an electrician who is familiar with local codes and regulations when wiring your dishwasher or any other appliance. An electrician who understands these codes can ensure that your appliance has been installed safely and correctly so you can use it worry-free!
