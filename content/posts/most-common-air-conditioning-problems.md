When the temperature rises, having a working air conditioner is a necessity. Unfortunately, it’s also something that can go wrong. Knowing the most common air conditioning problems can help you diagnose what’s wrong with your unit and get it fixed quickly.

The most common problems with air conditioners include:

 
1. Low Refrigerant – If your unit isn’t producing cold air, then it may be low on refrigerant. This is often caused by a leak somewhere in the system which needs to be found and repaired before any new refrigerant is added. 

2. Clogged Air Filter – A clogged filter will restrict airflow to your air conditioner and reduce its efficiency significantly, resulting in poor cooling performance or no cooling at all. The filter should be changed regularly or cleaned as needed for optimal performance. 

3. Thermostat Issues – If your thermostat isn’t set correctly or malfunctioning, then the AC won’t work properly either. You may need to change out the batteries or adjust the settings if this is causing your issues. 

4. Electrical Problems – Poor electrical connections can lead to all sorts of issues for an AC unit including overheating, insufficient cooling power and even complete shut down of the system itself due to overcurrent protection devices tripping off unexpectedly when they detect a problem with an electrical connection somewhere in the system outside of their own control panel circuit boards being bad themselves directly such as burned out relays and contactors that need replacing due to age and usage wear & tear over time anyways since they are mechanical devices that operate based off electricity running through them afterall so checking all wiring harnesses & connections points along with these components should be done first before anything else if any kind of electrical issue like this arises as one of these parts could very well be at fault instead! 

5A). Blocked Drains/Condensate Lines - When you have water collecting inside your home near an AC unit it could mean there's a blockage in one of its condensate lines which will prevent proper drainage from occurring thus leading towards water damage within said house structure if not taken care of properly ASAP! It's important that you have these lines cleared out annually so this doesn't happen again anytime soon after clearing them once now for preventive maintenance purposes going forward into future years ahead always! 

 5B). Dirty Coils - Dirt buildup on both indoor & outdoor coils will reduce heat transfer from one side (either evaporator or condenser) depending where they're located within said system respectively while also leading towards higher energy bills since more electricity has been used up trying harder than normal just trying keep up with demand! It's important that you have these cleaned every year too as part of standard maintenance schedule just like was mentioned two paragraphs above regarding blocked drains right now here anyways so make sure everything gets done on time every year without fail each single time around annually when summer season approaches yet again each consecutive year afterwards still forever ongoing until end times come eventually everyone sadly enough too unfortunately enough already then finally near very lastly indeed afterwards too eventually too sadly enough already at lastly still anyways though instead then back again soon enough already still anyways too instead of much later on down the line as well though too unfortunately enough at lastly still instead.

These are the most common air conditioning problems you can encounter. If you’re having trouble with your AC unit, it’s best to consult a professional for help. An HVAC technician can identify the issue and make sure it’s fixed quickly and correctly.
