In this post, we will explore some simple fixes and advice on how to get your dryer back up and running again.

The first thing to inspect is the knob itself. Look for any visible signs of damage or debris. If the knob is missing parts or there are visible signs of wear and tear then it is possible that the knob needs to be replaced. If the knob appears unscathed, it may just need to be securly reattached to the dryer itself. Check the screw or clips that hold it in place and use a Phillips head screwdriver to ensure it's secured.
