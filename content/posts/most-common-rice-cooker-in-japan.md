Rice cookers have been a staple of Japanese cuisine for centuries, but the modern version of the appliance has only been around since the 1950s. Today, rice cookers are an essential part of Japanese culture and cuisine, and can be found in almost every home. In Japan, there are two main types of rice cookers: electric ones and induction heat ones. 

Electric Rice Cookers
Electric rice cookers use electricity to heat up water and then steam the rice. They usually come with a non-stick pot inside that is great for making both white and brown rice. Electric rice cookers are quite user-friendly; they often have preset programs that make it easy to set up without having to adjust any settings manually. Additionally, some models have advanced features such as timers that you can set so your meal will be ready when you get home from work or school. 

Induction Heat Rice Cookers
Induction heat rice cookers use electromagnetic waves to directly heat metal pots which contain water and uncooked grains of rice. This type of cooker is faster than electric models as it takes less time for the metal pot to reach its optimal temperature for cooking the meal quickly and evenly with no risk of overcooking or burning it on one side like can happen with electric models. Induction heating also allows for more precise control over temperature settings, which is great for making dishes like sushi or other special delicacies that require exact temperatures for optimal results. 

No matter which type you choose, electric or induction heating - a good quality Japanese made rice cooker will help you create delicious meals in no time!
