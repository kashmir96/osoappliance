# How to clear a dishwasher drain trap

If you’ve noticed that your dishwasher isn’t draining properly, it may be time to clean out the drain trap. The drain trap is a small piece of plastic or metal located near the bottom of the dishwasher. It collects food particles and other debris that can clog the dishwasher drain, preventing it from draining properly. Fortunately, cleaning out the drain trap is a relatively simple process. 

Here’s how to do it: 

1. Unplug your dishwasher and turn off the water supply to it. 

2. Locate the drain trap at the bottom of your dishwasher. It should be a small piece of plastic or metal with a handle on one side and an open end on the other side. 

3. Carefully remove the drain trap from its housing by pulling on its handle or unscrewing it if necessary. Be sure to support it as you remove it so that any debris inside doesn’t fall into your dishwasher tub. 

4. Once you have removed the drain trap, use a flashlight to inspect its interior for any blockages or debris buildup that may be causing your dishwasher not to drain properly. 

5. Use a pair of pliers or tweezers to remove any debris from inside of the drain trap and discard them in an appropriate trash receptacle outside of your home (do not put them down your sink). 

6. Once you have removed all visible debris from inside of the drain trap, rinse it with warm water and re-install it back into its housing in your dishwasher tub making sure that it is securely fastened in place (check for any leaks). 

7. Plug in your dishwasher and turn on its water supply again before running a cycle through it to test if everything is working correctly now that you have cleared out its drain trap!

In conclusion, cleaning out your dishwasher’s drain trap is a relatively easy process that can help to prevent your dishwasher from not draining properly. All you need to do is unplug the dishwasher, locate the drain trap, remove it, inspect it for blockages or debris buildup, and then re-install it back into its housing. With just a few simple steps, you can help ensure that your dishwasher is running as efficiently as possible!
