In the kitchen of 2023, ovens may look and function quite differently than they do today. With the latest technology, ovens are becoming smarter and more efficient than ever before.

Smart ovens can now be connected to your home network and will allow you to control them remotely from your smartphone or tablet. This means you can easily preheat the oven while you’re on your way home from work so dinner is ready when you arrive. Some models even come with voice-activated controls so all you have to do is ask it to start preheating or turn off when dinner is ready.

The latest advancements in cooking technology are making it easier for people who don’t have a lot of time or experience in the kitchen to make delicious meals with minimal effort. Self-cleaning ovens can now detect what type of food has been cooked in them and adjust their cleaning cycle accordingly, so all you have to do is wipe down any remaining residue after it’s done its job. Smart sensors inside the oven will also detect when food is done cooking, so there’s no need to constantly check on it while it cooks. 

Energy efficiency has also improved significantly in recent years, with some models using up to 30 percent less energy than conventional electric ovens from just a few years ago. Some newer models also come with convection baking features that help evenly distribute heat throughout the entire cavity for even baking results every time. 

These are just a few of the improvements that we’re likely to see in oven technology by 2023 – but one thing remains unchanged: no matter what type of technological bells and whistles an oven may have, they all still require someone who knows how to use them properly if they want delicious results!
