If you’re looking to get the sleekest, straightest hair possible, a hair straightener is an invaluable tool. But if you’re not sure of the best practices for using a hair straightener, it can be easy to damage your hair. 

To help you get the best results from your straightening session, here are some tips on how to use a hair straightener safely and effectively. 

1. Start with clean, dry hair: Before you begin straightening your hair, make sure it is completely dry and free of any product build-up. Wet or damp hair can easily be damaged by the heat of a flat iron, so always make sure your locks are completely dry before you start styling. 

2. Use heat protectant: Heat protectants are essential when using a flat iron or other heated styling tools. These products help to create a barrier between your strands and the heat of the tool, reducing the chances of burning or drying out your locks. Apply a heat protectant before blow-drying and again before using your flat iron for best results. 

3. Use low heat settings: Most flat irons come with adjustable heat settings so that you can choose how hot you want the tool to get before styling. For most people, lower temperatures are usually sufficient for achieving sleek results without damaging their strands. Start with a lower setting and increase as needed until you find one that works for your hair type and texture. 

4. Take small sections: When using a flat iron, it’s important to take small sections of hair at a time for optimal results. Taking larger sections can lead to inconsistent results and may even cause more damage than necessary due to excessive heat exposure. For best results, work in two-inch sections or less when straightening each section of your mane. 

5. Use smooth strokes: When running the flat iron through each section of your locks, make sure to use smooth strokes instead of jerking or tugging at them as this can cause breakage and split ends over time. Move slowly and steadily through each section from root to tip until it is completely straightened before moving on to the next section of hair. 

Following these tips will help ensure that you get beautiful, sleek results from your next straightening session without causing any unnecessary damage to your locks! 

Examples of some of the best hair straighteners on the market include the Dyson Corrale Straightener and the GHD Platinum+ Professional Performance Styler. Both of these tools offer adjustable heat settings and are designed to provide sleek results without causing damage to your hair.
