The summer months can be a difficult time for renters when it comes to air conditioning. Most rental properties require tenants to keep their homes cool with central air conditioning systems or window units, but if the temperatures outside become unbearably hot, it can be difficult—or impossible—for tenants to stay comfortable inside their homes. In some cases, landlords may not provide proper maintenance of their air conditioning systems, leaving tenants in an unbearable situation.

When this happens, some renters may consider withholding rent as a way to force their landlord into addressing the problem. However, this is generally considered a risky move and should only be done as a last resort after all other attempts to communicate with the landlord have been exhausted. Before taking such an extreme step, there are other things that tenants can do:

• Contact the landlord directly: The first step should always be trying to contact the landlord directly and explaining your situation. A clear explanation of why you need help with your air conditioning system (such as if it’s not working properly) will go a long way towards getting your landlord’s attention and hopefully prompt them into action.

• Take pictures: Taking pictures of any visible damage or issues with your air conditioning system can also help prove that there is an issue that needs attention from your landlord. These pictures should also include date stamps so that they cannot later be contested by your landlord. 

• Send a certified letter: If you don’t get any response from the initial attempts at communication then it might be time to send out a certified letter requesting repair or replacement of the air conditioner and stipulating that failure to respond could result in legal action being taken against them. This will usually get most landlords’ attention quickly since they don’t want potential lawsuits on their hands over something like this! 

• Keep records: Make sure you keep all records of all communication between yourself and your landlord regarding the issue (text messages, emails etc.) as well as any receipts for repairs or replacements that you have paid for out-of-pocket in order to fix the problem yourself. These documents could come in handy if necessary if legal action needs to be taken against them later on down the road over noncompliance with tenant rights laws etc.. 


If these attempts fail however then withholding rent may sometimes become necessary in order for landlords take notice and start addressing these issues promptly before they get even more out of hand than what they already are! That being said though it is important for tenants remember that although withholding rent is often seen as an effective way force landlords into making repairs/replacements etc., this is still generally seen as an extreme measure by most and one which could potentially result in eviction proceedings against them so caution must always be exercised before taking such drastic steps!
