## Resetting Your Whirlpool Control Board
Resetting your Whirlpool control board is a crucial part of fixing and maintaining your home appliances. But it can be intimidating if you don't know your way around a circuit board. Never fear. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process.

First things first: locate the control board. It’s easy to overlook, but it’s essential to identify this part correctly. It’s usually found near the back or bottom of the appliance, and will have a cover over the board. Flip or remove this cover to begin.

Once the lid is off, it’s time to reset the board. You’ll usually see a reset button near the top of the control board. Use a flathead screwdriver to press the button, and leave it pressed until you hear a beep or the appliance restarts. This signifies that the control board has been reset and is ready for use.

If there's no reset button on the board, however, you can try power-cycling the board. To do this, you'll need to unplug the device and wait at least 10 seconds before plugging it back in. This will temporarily reset the board and help to resolve most common issues.

After you’ve reset the control board, turn on the device and test it. If the board didn’t reset or the appliance is still malfunctioning, it may be a sign of a deeper issue. If this is the case, you should refer to the error code provided in the appliance user manual.
