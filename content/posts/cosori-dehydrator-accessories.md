If you own a Cosori Dehydrator, you already know it is an incredible kitchen appliance that can help you make healthier snacks and meals. But did you know there are some great accessories that can help you get the most out of your dehydrator? In this blog, we’ll take a look at some of the accessories available to enhance your dehydrator experience. 

The first accessory on our list is an adjustable fruit leather tray. This tray allows you to customize the size and shape of your fruit leathers without having to constantly adjust the temperature or time settings on the dehydrator itself. The adjustable trays can also be stacked for more efficient and even drying, allowing you to make more snacks faster! 

Next up is a jerky gun kit. This kit comes with all the tools needed to turn ground meat into delicious strips of jerky. The kit includes a jerky gun with three different tip sizes for making different thicknesses of jerky, a roll mat for rolling out thin sheets of meat, and several curing ingredients like Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and onion powder so you can create an array of flavored jerky recipes. 

Finally, if your goal is to make healthy snacks on-the-go then consider investing in an expandable shelf set or stackable bin system. These shelves are easy-to-use accessories that allow you to store large amounts of food while still fitting inside your dehydrator. You can use them as storage containers for fruits or vegetables before drying or as storage containers after drying so that they’re ready when it’s time for snacking! 

Overall, these Cosori Dehydrator accessories are great additions for enhancing your snack making experience! With their help, not only will your snacks be healthier but they will be easier than ever before!
