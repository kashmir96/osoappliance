The Dyson Supersonic™ hair dryer is the perfect choice for anyone looking for a professional-grade hairdryer to use at home. It’s lightweight, quiet and powerful, making it ideal for those who need to dry their hair quickly and efficiently.

The Dyson Supersonic™ has been designed with advanced engineering that delivers a powerful yet gentle blow-dry. The motor is positioned in the handle of the hair dryer, making it light and balanced in your hand meaning you won't strain your arm or wrist while drying your hair. The motor is also acoustically tuned so it is quieter than other hairdryers and won't disrupt your peace and quiet.

The powerful motor coupled with the three speed settings, allows you to set the hairdryer to your preferred airflow for different drying techniques, making it easier to achieve a salon-worthy blowdry in your own home. The Dyson Supersonic™ also has four heat settings that can be adjusted depending on the type of hair you have, from fine to thick and curly hair.

To ensure maximum protection while drying, the Dyson Supersonic™ features a cold shot button which releases a blast of cool air at the end of each drying session. This helps to lock in hairstyles as well as reduce frizz and flyaways, leaving you with soft, smooth hair that looks salon fresh all day long.

The Dyson Supersonic™ comes with three different attachments: a smoothing nozzle that helps create sleek hairstyles; a styling concentrator for precise styling; and a diffuser which disperses air evenly around curls or waves to help define them without creating frizz or volume.

For those living in New Zealand, the Dyson Supersonic™ is available online or at select stores nationwide for an affordable price - making high-end style accessible from the comfort of your own home!
