## Unusual Noises From a Washing Machine

It can be unsettling when your washing machine makes strange or loud noises during the spin cycle. Noise that is not common or part of the usual functioning of the machine can be annoying and can even inhibit proper operation. It is important to understand that noises that are not normal are a sign of a potential problem and should be addressed as soon as possible. 

What Causes a Washing Machine to Make Unusual Noises?

Unusual noises coming from your washing machine can be due to a variety of potential issues. The most common ones are an off-balance load, rattling items within the machine, an unbalanced suspension, bearing issues, and even a worn out drive belt. 

Off-balance loads often result from attempting to wash too many items at the same time. Overloading a washing machine can cause it to vibrate and make strange noises. When the items become off-balance, the machine may not spin normally which can cause serious damage in the long run. 

Rattling items can also lead to strange noises during the spin cycle. Washing machine spin cycles work by agitating the contents, so anything like coins, socks, or other small items, can get caught in the agitator and cause rattling noises. 

An unbalanced suspension is when the drum of the washing machine is not properly connected and secured to the outside frame. This can cause a rattling noise or sometimes a loud bang. 

Other times, bearing issues are to blame. This can happen when the bearings in the drum of your washing machine wear out and can result in loud thumping or grinding noises. 

Finally, it can also be a worn out drive belt if the components start to age and wear out as a result of regular use. Combined with the motor and the drum, the drive belt can create a loud buzzing or thumping noise when spinning. 

Conclusion 

By understanding the different causes of unusual noises your washing machine can make when spinning, you can make a more educated decision on how to best address the issue. If possible, inspect the various parts of the machine and check for damage or loose pieces. If the problem persists, you may need to call in a professional appliance repair technician from our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for help.
