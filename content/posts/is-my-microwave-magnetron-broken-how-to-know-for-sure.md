## Assessing a Microwave Magnetron for Damage
Getting the best performance from your microwave requires you to know when to run repairs and replacement parts. Here we will provide an overview of identifying a broken microwave magnetron, and when to contact professional appliance services.

Your microwave might be malfunctioning due to a broken magnetron. The magnetron is the component responsible for producing the high-frequency current to heat up items. It's easy to identify a broken magnetron, when your microwave is not heating anything up at all. You can test the magnetron by removing the outside of the microwave, and test it with an ohm meter. Checking the continuity of the magnetron will tell you if it is still in working condition or if it needs replacing.

If you want to pursue a DIY approach, a new magnetron can be bought online or in a local store. When purchasing, it’s important to ensure the magnetron you purchase is compatible with your microwave. Installation of the new magnetron can be tricky and dangerous. We recommend reaching out to appliance and repair services if you’re not comfortable with the process.

In conclusion, if your microwave is malfunctioning, checking for a broken magnetron is a good place to start. You can assess the magnetron easily by running a continuity test on the magnetron, or if you are in doubt it may be best to have a professional service check it for you.
