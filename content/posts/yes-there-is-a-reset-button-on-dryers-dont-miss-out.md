##Yes, You Can Reset Your Dryers - Here's How

When you're confronted by a dryer that doesn't seem to be working, you don't have to start shopping for a new one right away. You might be surprised to learn that many dryers come with a handy reset button that can revive them and get them running again. 

When dryers experience a jammed door, internal errors, or other issues, resetting it can bring it back to life. While resetting your dryer isn't always possible, and there may be some technical problems that still require a visit by a professional, it can provide the restart you need to get your appliance up and running again. 

The most common method of resetting your dryer is to locate the reset button on the body of the appliance and press it firmly. Different manufacturers and models may have different reset buttons, so it is tell to consult your instruction manual first if possible. Generally, the reset button is on a lower part of the appliance, and is either red or black in color. When pressed, hold it for a few seconds and then release it. 

Sometimes dryer reset buttons are concealed inside. In this case, the appliance's back panel may need to be removed to reach it. Always ensure that the dryer is unplugged and switched off before attempting to reach inside. Replacement parts may need to be purchased to get the dryer up and running again. 

Your dryer is a valuable appliance, and a good reset can extend its life and functioning. Before you go and buy a new dryer, take a look at the resetting option first!
