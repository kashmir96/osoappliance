When it comes to laundry, having a reliable washing machine is essential. Taking good care of your laundry machine can maximize its lifespan and efficiency. Here are some best practices for taking care of your laundry machine:

1. Read the manual: Make sure to read the manual that comes with your washing machine before using it. It will provide you with important information on how to use the machine correctly and safely, as well as how to best take care of it over time.

2. Regularly clean the filter: A dirty filter can reduce the efficiency of your washing machine and lead to clogging issues. Make sure to regularly clean out the filter according to manufacturer instructions in order to avoid these problems.

3. Use the right detergent: Using too much or too little detergent can lead to poor cleaning results and damage your clothes as well as your washing machine over time. So make sure you always use the right amount (as per manufacturer instructions) for optimal performance and longevity of both your clothing and washing machine. 
 
4. Avoid overloading: Overloading can put too much strain on your washing machine’s motor, leading to inefficient performance and potential damage over time, so make sure you don’t overload your washer when doing laundry—fill it up only until about three-quarters full is ideal! 
 
5. Leave the lid open after use: Leaving the lid open after each use helps air out moisture from inside the washer that would otherwise end up creating bad odors if left closed for a long period of time—this also helps prevent mold growth inside too! 
 
6. Watch out for hard water buildup: Hard water buildup in washing machines is common in certain areas, leading to mineral deposits that reduce its performance over time—you can either invest in a water softener or just add a cupful of white vinegar once every three months into an empty cycle in order to help remove these deposits naturally! 

Following these best practices will help ensure that you get maximum life out of your washer while keeping it running smoothly and efficiently at all times!
