## How to Analyze Error Codes on an Electrolux Washing Machine

If you happen to own an Electrolux washing machine, you know that they are known for their high-quality performance and dependability.

For example, error code E17 signals that your draining system is clogged or that the water/pressure sensor is defective. Fixing this issue may require unclogging the drained tube or closing the water tap and restarting the draining process.
