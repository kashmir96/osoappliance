Infrared heaters are a great resource for providing warmth and comfort in your home. However, they can also present some hazards if not used properly. In this blog, weâ€™ll discuss the potential dangers associated with infrared heaters so that you can keep your family safe while enjoying the benefits of this heating system.

First and foremost, infrared heaters should never be left unattended while in operation. They operate on very high temperatures and can quickly cause a fire if not monitored properly. Even when attended to, it is important to keep combustible materials such as furniture or curtains at least three feet away from an active heater to avoid any unintended fire hazards. In addition to being careful with distances, it is also important to ensure that the heater is placed on a flat surface and away from any water sources such as sinks or bathtubs as contact with water could create an electrical hazard resulting in electrocution or even death. 

Another potential danger associated with infrared heaters is carbon monoxide poisoning caused by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels used by certain types of these heaters. While most modern models already have built-in safety systems designed to prevent such emissions, it is still wise to purchase only those units that are certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL). This will guarantee you a product free of harmful emissions and provide peace of mind during use. 

Finally, infrared heaters should be regularly inspected for any signs of wear or damage before use each season. Worn wires or loose connections can cause shocks or sparks which could present a further risk for fire in your home environment; thus, examining the unit frequently and replacing any damaged components immediately is essential for safety purposes. 

In conclusion, although infrared heaters provide a great source of warmth during colder months, there are several dangers associated with them which should be taken into consideration before using them in your home environment - ranging from fire risks due to improper placement/distance from combustible materials; carbon monoxide poisoning due to incomplete combustion; and electric shock due to worn wires/connections on older models - all measures need to be taken in order to protect both yourself and your family from unforeseen harm this winter season!
