## Setting up a Laundromat in NZ: An Introductory Review

New Zealand may not have the oldest laundromats in the world, but they are certainly some of the most cost effective to set-up and maintain. With the easing of regulations that come with a laundromat business model, it can be relatively less costly than trying to run a regular home laundry. Before you rush off to set-up shop though, there are a few things to be aware of. 

First, one of the most important considerations is the cost associated with setting up the business — particularly the equipment. Generally speaking, the necessary costs for a quality setup can range from around $26,000. This could include a coin box, laundry cards, coin machines, washers and dryers, hot water tanks, and of course the facility costs. However, you can potentially bring down the cost of your setup by renting or buying used machines. 

Modern washing machines also offer features such as motion sensors, digital displays, maintenance alerts, and more. All of these add to the costs, but they tend to make the business more efficient. Furthermore, if you choose to rent instead of buying your laundry equipment, you should factor in any rental fees and insurance costs as well. 

Once your business is up and running, you should also consider the cost of maintenance. This can be a tricky aspect to estimate as you never know when a machine will start to malfunction. But to ensure that your machines are running at their peak performance, you should assess the machines for damage and repair any issues as soon as possible. It is also important to factor in regular maintenance such as cleaning and servicing — not to mention the cost of detergents, softeners, and other supplies.

Finally, don’t forget about the costs associated with marketing and promotion. This may be a low priority for some, but given the rising competition in the laundromat business, marketing can make a big difference. Your location, branding, and the design of your website or shop front can all have an impact on your laundermat’s success.

Setting up a laundromat can be a profitable venture, but it is important to understand all the associated costs. By being aware of the equipment, rental, and maintenance costs, as well as the marketing and promotion expenses, you can ensure you set yourself up for success.
