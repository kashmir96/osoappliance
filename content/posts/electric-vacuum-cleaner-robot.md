Electric vacuum cleaner robots, also known as robotic vacuums, are a type of cleaning device that use motors and sensors to clean floors automatically. Robotic vacuums are becoming increasingly popular due to their convenience, effectiveness, and affordability. Robot vacuums come in various sizes and shapes to suit different needs, making them perfect for households of all sizes.

Robotic vacuums use sensors to detect dirt, dust and other dirt particles on the floor. The motor then drives the vacuumâ€™s brushes which sweep away dirt from the surface. Additionally, some robotic vacuum cleaners also feature special attachments that allow them to pick up pet hair or dust mites without any problem.

Robot vacuums offer several advantages over traditional vacuuming methods. First of all, they save time because they do not require manual operation like regular vacuum cleaners do; instead you can leave your robotic vacuum on its own while you go about your day-to-day business or take care of other chores around the house. Furthermore, robot vacuums can be used on carpets and hard surfaces with equal ease making them perfect for keeping your home spick-and-span without any extra effort from you! 

Another great advantage of robot vacuums is that they are relatively low maintenance since most models come with easy-to-understand instructions for taking care of them properly so that their lifespan is maximized. Moreover, these devices are energy efficient meaning that you will not have an excessive energy bill at the end of each month! 

Finally, robotic vacuums come in various shapes and sizes depending on your preferences as well as budget so if cost is a concern there are plenty of options available for you no matter what size or model you want!
