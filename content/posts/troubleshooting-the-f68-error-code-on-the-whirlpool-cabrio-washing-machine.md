## Troubleshooting Whirlpool Cabrio's F68 Error Code

When you're in the middle of a pile of laundry and your washer stops working, it's an instant bummer. You might be staring at your Whirlpool Cabrio washing machine and seeing the dreaded error code F68. No one wants to deal with a broken appliance, and it can be a hassle to repair. In this blog, we'll go over the steps to troubleshoot and fix the F68 error code.

The first step is to unplug your washing machine from the wall and then plug it back in. This will reset the electrical system to the machine, and might resolve the problem. That being said, this is not always the case, so you should be prepared to move on to more detailed diagnostics if the error code persists.

After unplugging the machine, if you can access the back of the washer, you should check the wiring there as well. Make sure that all of the connections are tight and secure. If any look warped, bent, or corroded, you'll want to replace the wire.

The error code F68 could be related to the control board of the washer, which is the main board that monitors and controls the different components of the machine. If the connections to the control board appear normal, you should look for visible signs of damage. If any damage is present, you'll need to replace the board.

At this point, if the error code persists or you are unable to check the wiring or control board, you'll want to contact a trained repair technician for assistance. Different companies offer appliance repair services, so youâ€™ll want to take the time to compare technicians in order to find the best fit for you.
