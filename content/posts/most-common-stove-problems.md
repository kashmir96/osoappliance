If you’re having problems with your stove, don’t panic! Many stove issues can be fixed simply and quickly. In this blog, we’ll cover the most common stove problems and how to fix them. 

The first problem you might experience is a gas odor coming from the oven. This is typically caused by a gas leak in the burners or lines. If you notice an odor of gas while using your oven, turn off all burners immediately and open all windows for ventilation before contacting a professional to inspect and repair your appliance. 

The next common issue is when the burner won't light or stay lit when ignited. This could be caused by a clogged burner head or spark electrode that needs to be cleaned or replaced. You can also check if any food particles have built up in the burner head which is preventing it from lighting properly. If this doesn't work, then it's likely that one of the components of the ignition system, such as an igniter switch or spark module may need replacing - so it's best to call in an appliance technician for assistance with these repairs. 

Another common problem is when food doesn't cook evenly on top and bottom elements of an electric range unit. This usually means there is an issue with heating element functioning correctly - either one side has burned out completely or isn't heating as much as it should be due to wear and tear over time . To diagnose this issue further inspect both elements closely for any burn marks on them which could indicate they are no longer working properly - if they are damaged then they will need replacing by a qualified technician who can get access to newer parts than what's available in hardware stores etc.. 

Finally, another frequent issue with stoves is when knobs become difficult to use due to age-related wear-and-tear on their internal mechanisms . In these situations often times just cleaning out some dirt/dust from within knob will do trick but if not then replacing entire knob assembly may be necessary depending severity situation . 

In conclusion , there are many different issues that can arise with stove appliances but fortunately most them are relatively easy fix requiring only basic tools/knowledge & patience ! With right care & maintenance , you'll have worry free cooking experience without any unexpected hiccups along way
