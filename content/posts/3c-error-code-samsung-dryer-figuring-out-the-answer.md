## Understanding the 3c Error Code on a Samsung Dryer
No matter the appliance, when we encounter an error code, it can be hard to know what it all means. A 3c error code, which is seen on Samsung dryers, is no exception. Knowing what this error code is and what it means is essential so that you can correctly troubleshoot and fix the problem.

The 3c error code is an indication of a fan motor fault. When the code appears, there are several things that may need to be checked. As most people do not have the know-how or tools to do these checks, it is expected that a professional identify the cause and then fix the problem. 

To start, there needs to be tests conducted to make sure that the fan motor is actually bad and to double-check that the fan blade and wiring isnâ€™t the root of the issue. The wiring should be inspected for any loose wires, frayed wires and any breaks. The blade itself should be tested to make sure it is still balanced and turning freely. When any of these components are not working as they should, the fan motor will be affected, which then triggers the 3c error code.

In addition to having a professional inspect the fan motor, replacing the knob is also a viable fix. This is usually done to pinpoint the source of the problem and will also afford the person working on the dryer the chance to see if the fan motor is working as it should. 

After the cause of the 3c error code has been identified, it can be confidently dealt with in a way that the problems stops and the dryer is safely operational again.

Troubleshooting an error code on any appliance can be stressful, but understanding the issue and knowing what to do about it makes the process much simpler.
