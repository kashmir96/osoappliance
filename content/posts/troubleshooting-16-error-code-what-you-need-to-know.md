## Diagnosing And Understanding 16 Error Code

When you find yourself with an appliance displaying a 16 error code, you will likely feel the urge to panic. But before you try and call in a service technician, you should take a moment to consider what the 16 error code could signify. This blog will discuss the 16 error code, and how to troubleshoot and diagnose it.

The 16 error code is typically associated with something running in the electronic control system. In order to locate the cause of the error, you will need to look for the exact source. To do this, you should check the electronic control board and any associated components to the control board. This could include the relay switches, capacitors, and wiring. Checking for any loose connections, damaged components, and corroded wires may be necessary. 

If necessary, you may also have to check the sensor and its associated components. In some appliances, the sensor might be a pressure sensor. The sensor could be faulty if it is sending an incorrect signal to the control board or if the sensor’s components have corroded. In these cases, the sensor or its components must be replaced.

If you are still unable to fix the problem after troubleshooting, another option would be to reset the appliance. Sometimes, resetting the appliance will resolve 16 error code. You will typically have to switch the appliance off at the mains and leave it that way for around 30 minutes. Afterwards, you can switch it back on and run a test run to see if the error persists. 

In some cases, the 16 error code may appear due to an unrelated electrical issue. If this is the case, you may need to inspect the entire appliance’s wiring for any issues. Additionally, if the appliance recently malfunctioned, the problem could be due to a power surge. It is worth checking for power surges if the error code appears suddenly.

Understanding the 16 error code and knowing what steps to take in order to diagnose and troubleshoot it is important. If you are still having difficulty, seeking the help of a qualified technician is recommended as they will be able to provide additional help or suggest corrective measures.
