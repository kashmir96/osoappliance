Dryer sheets are a common laundry tool used to reduce static cling and add a pleasant scent to laundry. However, you can use a dryer without a dryer sheet.

One way to reduce static cling without a dryer sheet is to add a damp towel to the dryer. The moisture in the towel will help reduce static cling and soften clothes. You can also add a few drops of fabric softener to the damp towel.

Another way to reduce static cling without a dryer sheet is to add a few drops of essential oils to a damp washcloth or piece of fabric. Place the cloth or fabric in the dryer with your laundry. The essential oils will help reduce static cling and add a pleasant scent to your laundry.

Finally, you can reduce static cling without a dryer sheet by using a metal dryer ball. Dryer balls are made of metal and help reduce static cling by bouncing around the dryer and separating clothes.

In summary, you can use a dryer without a dryer sheet. You can reduce static cling by adding a damp towel, fabric softener, essential oils, or a metal dryer ball to the dryer.
