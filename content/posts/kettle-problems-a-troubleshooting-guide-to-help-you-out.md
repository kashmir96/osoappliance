## Get to the Bottom of Kettle Problems with This Troubleshooting Guide
If your electric kettle isn't performing as expected, you'll want to figure out what's causing the problem before deciding to replace the appliance. In this article, we cover a few common issues and how you can repair them. Read on for a guide to troubleshooting kettle problems.

Sometimes it’s just a matter of flushing away any build-up of limescale deposits in your electric kettle. To do this, fill the kettle with a solution of three teaspoons of baking soda in one litre of water and leave it for a few hours. After this has been done, empty the kettle and rinse it well before boiling again.

If your kettle only heats partially when it’s switched on and you’ve checked out the limescale problem, it’s likely that the heating element is not working correctly. Depending on the age and make of your kettle, you may be able to easily replace the heating element yourself.

If the water in your kettle is taking longer to heat than before or it’s boiling over easily, it’s possible that the thermostat is to blame. This is a more complex problem that you may need to enlist the help of a trained technician to repair. The thermostat is an important part of an electric kettle and should only be replaced if you’re confident about doing the work.

If your kettle won’t power on at all, the most likely culprit is the connection between the cord and the base of the unit. Make sure the cord is securely pushed into the socket. If it’s not, use a flat head screwdriver to make sure it’s pushed as far in as it can go before plugging it in again. If the kettle still won’t turn on, you may require a replacement power cord.

No matter the problem you’re experiencing with your electric kettle, it pays to take time to troubleshoot any issues before rushing out to buy a new one. While some problems can be easily fixed, more complex issues may require the help of a trained technician to get your kettle back up and running. If you're struggling to repair your electric kettle, don't hesitate to reach out to a reputable appliance repair specialist.

## Common Kettle Problems

1. **How can I fix a kettle that won’t turn on?** Check the power cable first to ensure it is connected securely. If everything looks good, check the fuse of the power outlet or reset the circuit breaker if necessary.

2. **What should I do if the kettle won’t heat water?** If the kettle won’t heat up the water, it could be because there is too much lime scale buildup inside. Clean the kettle with vinegar and water, using a long brush to remove any buildup.

3. **Is it safe to leave a kettle unattended?** No – it is not safe to leave a kettle unattended while it is in use, as it could overheat and potentially cause an electrical fire.

4. **What should I do if water is leaking from the kettle?** Check the seal of the lid, as this could be causing the leak. If the seal is worn down, you should replace it with a new one.

5. **What should I do if the handle of the kettle is loose or broken?** If the handle is wobbly, make sure the screws are tightened. If the handle is broken, it's best to get a new kettle as old, broken parts can be unsafe.

## Key Takeaways

1. Flushing away limescale build-up with a baking soda solution may help resolve electric kettle issues.
2. If a kettle only heats partially, the heating element may need to be replaced.
3. A slow boiling or boiling over easily can indicate an issue with the thermostat.
4. Check that the power cord is securely pushed into the socket before replacing the cord.
5. If troubleshooting does not solve the issue, an appliance repair specialist can be consulted.
