Having a clean and odor-free washing machine is just as important as having clean clothes. Unfortunately, we often forget about our washing machines until they need to be cleaned. Regularly cleaning your washing machine can help prevent bacteria growth, odors and dirt buildup.

Luckily, cleaning a washing machine doesn't have to be complicated or time consuming. Here are some simple hacks you can use to keep your washer in tip-top shape: 

1) Run an empty cycle with hot water and vinegar: Start by adding two cups of white vinegar into the detergent drawer of your washer and run an empty cycle with hot water. This will help break up any build up of dirt and soap scum that has accumulated in the drum of the washing machine over time. 

2) Clean around the seal: The seal around the door is one area that tends to accumulate mold over time due to moisture getting trapped inside it. To prevent this from happening, use an old toothbrush dipped in a solution made out of warm water and baking soda to clean the area around the seal once a month or so. 

3) Use bleach for tough stains: If you have stubborn stains on the inside drum of your washer, try using bleach instead of vinegar for better results. Fill your washer with hot water (preferably at least 90 degrees Fahrenheit), add about two cups of bleach, then let it run through an entire cycle without any clothes in it before rinsing out with cold water afterwards. 

4) Clean hoses regularly: Hoses should also be checked every month or so for any signs of wear or tear since this could lead to leaks or even flooding if left unchecked. You can easily wipe down these hoses with warm soapy cloths if needed; however, make sure they’re completely dry before reattaching them back onto your washing machine! 
 
By following these simple tips on how to properly clean your washer, you’ll be able to keep it running smoothly while ensuring that all clothes come out sparkling clean each time!
