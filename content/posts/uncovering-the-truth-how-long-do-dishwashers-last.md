## Uncovering Dishwasher Lifespans

Modern dishwashers can easily help make clean-up after mealtime a breeze. Finding the right dishwasher that is reliable and will properly clean your dishes while lasting for many years to come can be tricky. How long do dishwashers actually last and what factors can help you make the right choice? We have the answers. 

More often than not, a standard dishwasher should last up to 12 years with proper care and maintenance. Of course, the actual lifespan of your dishwasher can greatly depend on its model, the quality of the materials and the maintenance habits of the user.

Installing a high-grade dishwasher and providing routine maintenance can ensure a longer lifespan that can range up to 16 or 18 years. Itâ€™s important to remember that all dishwashers will require proper upkeep to continue running effectively and efficiently. This requires regularly running a deep clean cycle using a cleaning formula that can dissolve food residue and other kinds of dirt. Refilling the dishwasher's salts and rinse aid storage compartments is also necessary for optimal performance. 

When shopping for a dishwasher, try to seek out models that are more energy efficient and are designed with features that suit your needs. Bosch and Miele are two highly recommended brands for their quality, durable design and reliable performance. Paying a bit extra for such a dishwasher can save you money in the long run.

Getting the right dishwasher with the right features and inspecting it regularly to make sure it is in top condition are all key components to making sure your dishwasher can last as long as possible.
