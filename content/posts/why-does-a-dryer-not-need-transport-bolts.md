When it comes to dryers, one of the most common questions is why they don’t need transport bolts. Transport bolts are used to secure the drum of the dryer during shipping and installation. Many people assume that transport bolts are necessary to keep the drum in place during transportation, but this is actually not the case.

The reason why a dryer doesn’t need transport bolts is because the drum is already held in place by the suspension system. The suspension system is made up of two components: the drum support rollers and the suspension springs. The rollers are mounted on the back of the dryer and they support the weight of the drum. The suspension springs are attached to the front of the dryer and they keep the drum in place. This system ensures that the drum remains stable and secure during transportation and installation.

The suspension system is designed to keep the drum in place even when the dryer is moved around. This means that the transport bolts are not necessary to keep the drum in place. In fact, using transport bolts can actually damage the suspension system and cause the dryer to vibrate or make loud noises during operation.

In conclusion, a dryer does not need transport bolts because the drum is held in place by the suspension system. The suspension system is designed to keep the drum in place even when the dryer is moved around. Using transport bolts can actually damage the suspension system and cause the dryer to vibrate or make loud noises during operation.
