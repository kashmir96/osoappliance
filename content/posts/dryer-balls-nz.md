Dryer balls are a fantastic way to reduce drying time and energy costs while still taking care of your clothing. They are a great eco-friendly alternative to chemical fabric softeners, as they are made from natural materials and can be reused over and over again. But what exactly are dryer balls?

Dryer balls, also known as wool dryer balls or washing balls, are small round items made of felted wool that have been designed to be placed in the dryer with your laundry. As the dryer spins, the wool balls bounce around in the air and against your clothes, creating friction which helps soften fabric fibers as well as shorten drying times by fluffing up fabrics. This also helps reduce static cling caused by synthetic fabrics such as polyester or nylon. 

In addition to reducing energy costs and shortening drying times, these little wonders can also help you save money on fabric softener since there is no need for it anymore when using dryer balls! All you have to do is add a few drops of essential oil onto each ball before adding them into the machine - this will provide a light fragrance that will stay on your clothes after they’re done being dried. 

When using NZ-made wool dryer balls you can rest assured that you’re doing your part for sustainability - all of our products are ethically sourced from local farmers who raise their sheep humanely without any added chemicals or pesticides used on their land. Furthermore, all packaging is fully recyclable so you won’t have to worry about creating any extra waste! 

So if you’re looking for an eco-friendly way to get softer clothes faster while saving yourself some money in the process then look no further than NZ-made wool dryer balls!
