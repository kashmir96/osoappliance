## Understanding Standard Dishwasher Rack Sizes 

When it comes to your daily routine, having a dishwasher can be an incredible timesaver and help you get through your chores with ease. But what are the average dishwasher rack sizes and how do you know if your model will fit the available space you have to work with? This blog will discuss an overview of the standard dishwasher sizes to help you understand the measurements you'll need to determine the best fit for your household appliances. 

The standard dishwasher contains two racks: an upper, above the dishwasher's spray arm and a lower below the upper rack. Depending on the model, the racks may contain a clipboard and collapsible shelves. Dividers between the racks are also common in larger dishwashers, for keeping your dishes, cups, and silverware safe and secure. 

The typically accepted dishwasher rack sizes include 24, 18 and 15 inch widths. A standard height of 34 inches is also available for full size-dishwashers. For more obvious purposes, if you are buying a dishwasher for a single-family home, the dishwashers come in standard depths of 25.5 inches and 24 inches, respectively. If you plan to install a larger dishwasher or one that is deeper than 25.5 inches, extra cabinet modifications may be required. 

If you are unable to find the standard dishwasher size that you are looking for, you can also build a custom size dishwasher or have a professional contractor help you with modifications. If a dishwasher is ordered with a custom-made base, measurements of the base must be taken to ensure a proper fit in relation to the specific width and depth of the dishwasher. 

It is important to note that the size of a dishwasher that you get does not necessarily determine how successful your dishes will be cleaned. Make sure to check the features of the dishwasher and its of wash cycles before you make your purchase.

When it comes to purchasing a dishwasher, understanding the standard sizes will give you the information you need to make the best decision for your space and needs. Take time to measure the area where you plan to install the appliance and match it to the appropriate size before you make any decisions.
