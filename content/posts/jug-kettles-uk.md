Jug kettles are a popular choice among UK households. They’re stylish, convenient and easy to use. But what exactly is a jug kettle?

In short, a jug kettle is an electric water heater in the shape of a jug. It has a spout at the top, which you tip to pour hot water for hot drinks such as tea or coffee. It can also be used for boiling pasta or making soups and other dishes. 

Jug kettles come in all shapes, sizes and materials from stainless steel to glass – so you can find one that suits your kitchen décor perfectly. They are generally much larger than standard kettles, making them great for busy households who need plenty of hot water on demand. Plus they often come with large capacity tanks so you don’t have to fill them up frequently. 

Jug kettles also offer plenty of convenience features such as temperature settings and auto shut-off timers so you can get your hot drinks just right every time with minimal effort! Some even have LED displays that let you know how full/empty the tank is or how many cups of hot liquid it can produce before needing to be refilled – perfect if you’re hosting guests! 

All in all, jug kettles provide an attractive way to heat up water quickly and easily in your home – perfect for those who like their drinks just right!
