## Can Laundromats Open in Level 4: A Look at COVID-19 Restrictions for Laundry Services 

As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, understanding where your state lies in terms of reopening is key. Different states have adopted different measures and levels of restrictions to combat the spread of COVID-19. These can range from no restrictions, to stay at home orders, and even full lockdowns. 

When it comes to laundry services such as laundromats or dry cleaners, there are additional considerations that must be taken into account due to their close contact nature. As a result, many states have put specific guidelines in place for these services depending on their current level of restriction. 

For instance, currently most states are operating under some form of Level 4 restrictions which generally allow businesses deemed essential to remain open while taking extra health and safety measures such as social distancing and wearing face masks in order reduce the spread of infection among customers. This means that laundromats can remain open under Level 4 restrictions but may need to limit the number of people allowed inside at any one time or implement other safety protocols such as requiring customers wear gloves while using machines or providing hand sanitizer stations throughout their premises. 


In some cases however, certain regions might go beyond just allowing laundromats to remain open by implementing additional services such as contactless pickup/delivery options or providing personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff members in order keep customers safe during visits. 

Overall then it’s important for everyone who uses laundry services regularly understand what specific measures are being taken by their local establishments so they know how best protect themselves when doing laundry during this pandemic period. Additionally if you’re looking for an even safer way do your laundry while still having access all the necessary amenities then consider renting an appliance instead! This way you don’t need worry about shared spaces at all and can enjoy clean clothes without risk from home - [check out our directory](./pages/appliance-rental) if this sounds like something you're interested in!
