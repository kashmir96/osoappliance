Moving a washing machine up stairs can be a daunting task. From heavy lifting to cramped doorways and sharp turns, it can seem like an impossible job. But with the right tools and techniques, you can get your new appliance up the stairs without too much hassle.

First, prepare your route. Take note of any obstacles or tight spaces that will need to be navigated around in order to get the washing machine upstairs safely. You'll also want to measure any doorways along the route so you know if they are wide enough for the machine to fit through easily.

Next, you'll need some assistance from friends or family members who are strong and able-bodied enough to help out with moving the appliance. It's important that everyone involved is wearing gloves for protection against cuts or scrapes from lifting and maneuvering the washer into place on each step of its journey upwards. 

Once you've got your helpers on board, it's time to get moving! Place a tarp or blankets down on each step of your staircase before starting in order to protect both them and your new washing machine from any damage that could occur during transit. Then carefully lift one side of the washer while one person steadies it from below and another person lifts it up onto each step at a time until it reaches its desired location upstairs. When possible, try using furniture slides underneath the washer so that you can move it more easily over carpeted surfaces without damaging them in transit! 

Finally, make sure all connections are secure before plugging in your new appliance and testing out its functions – this will help ensure everything is working correctly once installed upstairs! With these tips in mind, you’ll have no trouble getting your washing machine delivered safely up those stairs!

If you end up paying someone else to do it, make sure they're aware of the stairs as this often costs extra.
