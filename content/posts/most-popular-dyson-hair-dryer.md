This high-tech device uses a powerful motor and advanced technology to provide fast drying, controlled styling, and healthy-looking hair.

The Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer has many features that make it stand out from other conventional hair dryers. It is designed with a digital V9 motor which provides a powerful airflow of up to 13 litres per second to quickly and efficiently dry your hair. It also includes 4 heat settings, 3 speed settings, and a cool shot setting which give you more control over your drying experience. 

For added convenience and ease of use, the Supersonic comes with an intelligent heat control system that prevents extreme temperatures from damaging your hair as well as magnetic attachments for styling flexibility.
