## Tips for Rebooting Your Washing Machine
Are you looking for a way to reboot your washing machine? Don't worry, you don't need to be a tech guru to do it! In this blog, we’ll explain the steps you need to take to reboot your washing machine. 

First, depending on the model of your washing machine, you’ll want to unplug the machine from the electrical outlet. Setting your machine to “off” or “stand-by” mode may also be required. For some machines, you may need to press and hold a button for a few seconds to ensure that your washer is turned off. 

Once the washing machine has been unplugged or the buttons are in place, you’ll need to leave it untouched for at least five minutes. This gives the appliance time to reboot properly. After the five minutes have passed, plug the machine back in and restart the cycle. Check the power setting to make sure it is on the same setting that you used prior to rebooting. 

Now your washing machine should be rebooted and ready to go. If you're still having difficulty, contact a certified appliance repair technician for assistance. A technician can help diagnosing and resolving any error codes your washing machine may be displaying. Our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) can help you get an idea of what's going on.

Rebooting your washing machine is the best way to get your appliance back in working shape. It's usually the quickest and most cost-effective method before seeking service from an appliance technician.
