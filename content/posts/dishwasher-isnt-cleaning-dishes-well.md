If you've noticed that your dishwasher isn't cleaning dishes as well as it used to, you're not alone. Over time, dishwashers can become clogged with food particles and detergent residue, leaving your dishes with a cloudy film or residue. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to get your dishwasher back on track.

First, check the filter. Dishwasher filters can become clogged with food particles, which can prevent the dishwasher from properly cleaning dishes. To clean the filter, remove it from the dishwasher and rinse it off with water. You can also use a brush to scrub away any stubborn food particles.

Next, check the spray arms. If the spray arms are clogged with food particles, they won't be able to spin freely and spray water onto the dishes. To clean the spray arms, remove them from the dishwasher and soak them in a sink filled with warm, soapy water. Use a brush to scrub away any food particles.

Finally, check the detergent. If you're using the wrong type of detergent or too much detergent, it can leave a residue on your dishes. Make sure you're using the correct type of detergent and the correct amount for your dishwasher.

By taking these steps, you should be able to get your dishwasher back on track and ensure that your dishes are sparkling clean.
