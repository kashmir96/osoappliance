# Gas hob wont ignite

If your gas hob won't ignite, there are a few possible causes you should consider. The most common cause is a problem with the ignition system. This could be due to a faulty spark module, an issue with the spark electrodes, or even a blocked gas valve. It's also possible that the gas supply has been turned off or is blocked in some way.

The first thing to do if your gas hob won't ignite is to check that the power is on and that all of the connections are secure. If everything looks okay, then it's time to check the ignition system. Start by checking the spark module for any signs of damage or corrosion. If it looks okay, then move on to checking the spark electrodes for any blockages or damage. Finally, check that the gas valve is open and not blocked in any way.

If you can't find any problems with these components, then it's likely that there's an issue with your gas supply. Check that all of your pipes are connected properly and that there aren't any leaks in them. You may also need to check if your meter has been turned off at some point and needs resetting before you can use it again.

Once you've identified and fixed the problem with your gas hob, make sure you test it out before using it again to ensure everything is working correctly. If you're still having trouble getting your hob to ignite after trying these steps, then contact a qualified engineer who can help diagnose and fix the issue for you safely and quickly.
