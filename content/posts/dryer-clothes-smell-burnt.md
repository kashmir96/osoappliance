If you’ve ever opened up your dryer to find your clothes smelling like they’ve been through a campfire, you’re not alone. Burnt clothes smell is a common problem with dryers and it can be a sign of a larger issue. Here’s what you need to know about why your clothes might smell burnt and how to fix it.

The most common cause of burnt clothes smell is lint buildup in the dryer. Lint is the tiny fibers that come off of clothes as you’re drying them, and it can become trapped in the dryer’s lint trap or inside the dryer’s vents. When this happens, the lint can heat up and start to burn, causing a burnt smell.

To prevent lint buildup, make sure to clean the lint trap after each use and to check the vents for clogs every few months. Also, make sure to clean your dryer’s drum after each use to remove any excess lint.

Another possible cause of burnt clothes smell is a faulty heating element. If the heating element is not working properly, it can overheat and cause the clothes to burn. If you suspect this is the problem, it’s best to call a professional to inspect and repair the dryer.

Finally, another possible cause of burnt clothes smell is a blocked exhaust vent. If the exhaust vent is blocked, it can cause the dryer to overheat, leading to burnt clothes smell. To prevent this, make sure to check the exhaust vent for blockages every few months.

If your clothes still smell burnt after cleaning the lint trap, inspecting the heating element, and checking the exhaust vent, it’s best to call a professional for help. A professional can help you identify the cause of the issue and get your dryer back in working order.
