## Repairing a Broken GE Dryer Knob

Having a broken dryer knob can be a real hassle for GE dryer owners. Luckily, it doesn't have to be. With a few simple steps you can easily fix your own dryer knob and get your laundry done quickly.

The first step is to locate a replacement knob. Fortunately, The GEDryer offers a wide selection of knob styles and sizes. Simply select the knob style and size that matches the original knob. If unsure, measure the diameter of the broken knob and search for an exact replacement on the site.

Next, you'll need to remove the old knob. Carefully unscrew the base of the knob with a flathead screwdriver. Once the knob has been removed, carefully remove the back plate with a Phillips head screwdriver. This will reveal the coarse thread. Carefully remove the nut with needle-nose pliers.

Now, it's time to install the new knob. Put the new knob into the back plate and attach the nut to the coarse thread. Then screw the knob base back into the dryer panel and make sure it's secure. Now your dryer knob should be as good as new.

With this simple guide, you can easily replace a broken GE dryer knob and get your laundry done quickly.
