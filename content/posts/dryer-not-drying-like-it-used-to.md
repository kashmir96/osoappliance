As your dryer ages, you may start to notice that it’s not drying like it used to. This can be an annoying problem, but the good news is there are some easy things you can do to help get your dryer back in top-notch shape. 

One of the most common causes of poor drying is a clogged lint trap or vent. Lint can build up over time and block air from passing through the filter, reducing the efficiency of your appliance and resulting in longer drying times or damp laundry. To ensure proper airflow, regularly clean the lint trap and exhaust vent with a vacuum cleaner or a stiff brush — this will help keep your clothes dry in less time. 

Another culprit might be worn-out parts such as belts and heating elements. Over time, these components can become weak or damaged and fail to produce enough heat for effective drying. Replacing these essential parts is key to restoring full function — check with the manufacturer for specific instructions on how to replace them safely and effectively. 

Finally, there may be an issue with thermostat calibration if you find that items aren't completely dry after a cycle has finished running — this could indicate that temperature settings need adjustment due to temperature fluctuation over time. If this is happening, consult your owner's manual for detailed instructions on how to calibrate your particular model’s thermostat so it functions correctly and helps maximize energy efficiency while still getting maximum drying power from each cycle run. 

Dryers are essential appliances for many households — they save us time by quickly drying our clothes so we don't have to hang them out in wet weather or wait hours before they're ready for wear again. With regular maintenance like lint filter cleaning and part replacement when needed, you can keep your machine working optimally so that it continues providing all its benefits without worry of damp laundry days!
