Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular in New Zealand homes because of the many health benefits they offer. An air purifier helps to improve your indoor air quality by removing airborne particles such as dust, pollen, pet dander, and other allergens. It also helps to reduce odors and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) from cleaning products and other household items.

When shopping for an air purifier in New Zealand, it is important to consider the size of the room that you would like to use it in. This is because an air purifier’s effectiveness depends on its ability to filter out pollutants from a specific area. Generally speaking, a bigger room requires a larger capacity air purifier than a smaller one. Additionally, make sure that your chosen unit has filters certified by HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) standards as these are designed to effectively capture 99% of particles down to 0.3 microns in size which is small enough for most common pollutants found indoors. 

You should also take into account the type of filter your chosen unit uses as this will affect how often you will need to replace them - usually every 3 – 6 months depending on usage and quality of filter material used - which can be costly over time if not taken into consideration when making your purchase decision. It’s also important to note that some models require an additional pre-filter which needs changing more frequently than the main HEPA filter itself - so make sure you check what type of filter each model has before buying! 

Finally, keep an eye out for any special features that may be included with the unit such as timers or remote control capabilities; these can be very useful if you want more flexibility when using your air purifier or just want something easier to manage without having to constantly adjust settings manually each time!
