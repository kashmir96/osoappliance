A business dishwasher is a valuable piece of equipment for any foodservice establishment. Whether you run a restaurant, cafe, or catering business, having the right commercial dishwasher can help ensure that your dishes are clean and hygienic. 

When choosing a commercial dishwasher for your business, there are several factors to consider such as size and type. The size of the machine will depend on the volume of dishes you need to wash and how often you need to do it. For example, if you have a large restaurant with many customers, then you’ll need a larger machine than if you own a small cafe with fewer customers. 

In terms of types, there are two main kinds: high-temperature and low-temperature models. High-temperature models use hot water to sanitize dishes while low-temperature models rely on chemical sanitizers like chlorine or quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATs). Both types can effectively clean dishes but high-temperature machines may be more expensive to operate due to their higher energy consumption. 

When selecting a commercial dishwasher for your business it is important to consider not only the size and type but also features such as cycle times, water usage levels, ease of use/maintenance, energy efficiency ratings and even noise levels (if it will be used in an area where noise could be an issue). Additionally, make sure that the model selected is appropriate for the type of dishes being washed (e.g., glassware vs. pots & pans) as different types require different cycle times or temperatures in order to get them properly cleaned and sanitized. 

Finally, when shopping for a commercial dishwasher remember that price should not be the only deciding factor – quality should also play an important role in your decision making process so make sure that any potential purchases meet all necessary safety standards before making your purchase!
