## How to Identify and Resolve Washing Machine Problems
Most washing machine issues can be easily identified and resolved with a little bit of troubleshooting. Knowing how to diagnose a problem and how to run a diagnostic is key to fixing a washing machine in the most efficient manner possible.

There are several common washing machine issues that consumers encounter. The most common issues are related to insufficient draining, inadequate water supply, loud noise, unexpected overflows, and unbalanced washing cycles. In many cases, the cause of the issue can be rooted in the control panel and can be fixed by resetting the machine.

In some cases, a bigger problem may be at hand, such as a worn-out part or electrical failure. In these cases running a diagnostic will be necessary. Diagnostics can often identify where and what is wrong with your washing machine, so that it can be fixed in a timely manner.

Diagnostics can be run in several ways and depend on the manufacturer. Some manufacturers, for example, produce their own diagnostic apps, which can be downloaded onto a device and used to troubleshoot any issues with the washing machine. Be sure to check the washing machine's instruction manual to find out what options and apps are available.

For those with a more basic understanding of washing machine operations, it is sometimes possible to run a diagnostic without any additional tools. Listening out for unusual noises, shaking and checking the drum, and poking around the hoses and valves may help to identify faults in the machine.

In some cases, however, it's best to contact a professional wash machine technician to run a diagnostic on the machine. An appliance professional will have the experience and expertise necessary to accurately detect any issues that may be present with the washer.

No matter what type of washing machine problem you're facing, it's important to identify the fault and run a helpful diagnostic. Doing this will save time and money, and ensure that your washing machine is up and running once again.
