A mini fridge is a great way to keep food and drinks cold in a small space. But how much does one cost? The answer depends on what size and features you’re looking for. 

Mini fridges come in many sizes, from under the counter models to full-sized versions that can fit up to 30 bottles of beer. Smaller models are usually cheaper, with prices ranging from $50 to $200. 

The cost of a larger mini fridge will depend on the capacity and features. For example, some full-sized models are equipped with an automatic defrost system and adjustable shelves, which can add significantly more to the price tag. Prices for these types of mini fridges generally start at around $250 and can run up to several hundred dollars or even more depending on the brand and model you choose. 

In addition to size and features, factors such as energy efficiency ratings (such as Energy Star rated products) may also affect price. More energy efficient fridges tend to cost more upfront but will save money over time by using less power than traditional refrigerators while still keeping your food cold effectively. 

No matter what type or size of mini fridge you’re looking for, there are plenty of options available that fit your budget and needs – so don’t be discouraged if your first search yields prices outside your range!
