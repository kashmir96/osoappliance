## How Much Scrap Can You Salvage from an AC Unit?
Every year roughly 11 million air conditioning units reach their end of life across the United States, with the highest concentrations in states with the hotter climates. With this large surge of disused AC units, many people are left wondering how much scrap metal can be salvaged and recycled from them. 

The surprising truth is that an old air conditioning unit contains a surprising amount of valuable scrap metal. The vast majority of air conditioning units are either made of aluminum, copper, or a combination of both. Aluminum is one of the most commonly recycled metals and can be sold for anywhere from $0.20 to $1.50 per pound. Meanwhile, copper can be sold for much more, anywhere from $2 to $4 per pound. Recovering both metals from a single unit can be quite profitable.

On top of these two metals, many air conditioning units are also made with several other metals such as steel, brass, and zinc. Recovering all of these metals can also result in a direct and tangible benefit for those willing to dismantle an old AC unit. 

The amount of scrap metal that can be recovered from an air conditioning unit, unsurprisingly, depends on many variables such as the unit's size, materials, and condition. Taking the size of the unit into account, the average air conditioning unit contains anywhere from 30 to 70 pounds of scrap metal depending on the size of the unit and the materials used. This can result in a direct benefit to the consumer although it is recommended in most cases to contact a professional before attempting to dismantle an old unit on your own.

Overall, there’s a surprisingly large amount of scrap metal that can be recovered and recycled when you decompose an old air conditioning unit. If you’re looking for an easy way to make a few extra bucks and stay green at the same time, recycling an old AC may be the perfect option for you.
