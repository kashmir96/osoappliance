If you’re looking for a more efficient and versatile way to cook, an induction stove can be a great choice. An induction stove is a type of electric stove that uses an electromagnetic field to heat the cooking surface, as opposed to gas or electric burners which use direct heat. In New Zealand, induction stoves are becoming increasingly popular due to their energy efficiency and convenience.

Induction stoves work by creating an electromagnetic field between the cooktop and the pot or pan that you are using. As the magnetic field increases, it creates resistance in the metal of your pot or pan which causes it to heat up quickly. This means that your food cooks faster than with other types of stoves, saving you time and energy costs!

Induction stoves are also safer than traditional gas or electric cooktops as they don’t create any open flames or hot surfaces that could be a hazard in the kitchen. The induction process also helps keep your kitchen cooler as it doesn’t generate any additional heat like other types of stoves do. 

Another great feature of induction stoves is their versatility – they come with different cooking modes such as simmering, boiling and stir-frying so you can easily adjust the temperature to suit whatever dish you’re cooking. Plus they have precise temperature settings so you can easily control how hot your food gets without having to guess by eye like with other types of cooktops. 

Finally, many induction stoves come with advanced features such as timer settings so you don’t have to worry about forgetting about meals on the stovetop! All these features combine to make an incredibly convenient way for New Zealanders to cook their meals quickly and efficiently in their kitchens at home.
