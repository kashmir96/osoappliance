We know that curly hair is a blessing, but it can be a bit of a challenge to manage. Whether you want to maintain your curls or create new ones, you may want to consider investing in a good quality hair dryer for curly hair. 

When looking for a good quality hairdryer for curly hair, there are several features you should look out for. Firstly, the power of the hairdryer is an important factor. Curly hair tends to require more heat and air pressure than straight hair, so make sure you select one with enough power and wattage to get the job done properly. 

Next up is the type of diffuser that comes with your hairdryer. Diffusers are attachments which disperse the airflow from your hairdryer so that it doesnâ€™t create hot spots in one area of your head while drying your curls. Look out for diffusers specifically designed for curly hair as they often have more flexible prongs which can better work through your curls and reduce frizziness. 

Another great feature to look out for when choosing a hairdryer specifically designed for curly hair is ionic technology. Ionic technology helps create smoothness in your locks by reducing static and frizziness as well as helping retain moisture in the strands of your hair. This helps keep those pesky flyaways at bay! 

Finally, make sure you also check out what other accessories come with the hairdryer such as concentrators and cold shot buttons (which help set styling). The more options available on a dryer, the better equipped you will be when trying to style or maintain curls! 

All in all, investing in a good quality hairdryer specifically designed for curly hair is essential if you want to achieve great results every time! With so many options available on the market today from various brands - including some excellent ones here in NZ - finding one perfect fit should not be too difficult!
