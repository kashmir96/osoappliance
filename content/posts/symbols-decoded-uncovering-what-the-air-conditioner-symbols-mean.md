## Discovering the Meaning Behind Air Conditioner Symbols
With the wide variety of symbols and features on modern air conditioners, it can be hard to decipher the purpose of each one. But knowing the basic symbols and their meanings can help to make sure your air conditioner is working correctly and to troubleshoot any issues that arise.

The easiest way to mount a defense against breakdowns or malfunctions is by understanding what each control symbol in your air conditioner indicates. Here is a list of the common air conditioner symbols you may see, as well as a brief explanation of what they mean. 

* The fan symbol: This symbol indicates that the fan speed setting has been adjusted. The lower the setting, the lower the speed. 

* The snowflake symbol: This symbol indicates that the air conditioner is cooling the air.

* The power symbol: This symbol indicates that the air conditioner has been turned on.

* The timer symbol: This symbol indicates that the timer has been set. The user can set a designated time for the air conditioner to turn itself on or off.

The symbols located on the air conditioner control panel can provide users with valuable information to help them operate their units more efficiently and accurately.
