Are you getting an error code E-11 on your Samsung microwave? This error may be caused by a variety of problems, but don't worryâ€”it can be fixed. Follow the troubleshooting steps below to get your microwave up and running again.

The first thing to do when confronting any appliance issue is to try the basic fixes. This includes unplugging the microwave, waiting a few minutes, and then plugging it back in. If the error code persists then there may be an underlying mechanical or electrical problem. 

The next step is to check some of the internal components. Open up the appliance and make sure none of the cords or wires have come loose or uncoupled. Inspect for any visible signs of damage or corrosion, which is often the cause of these issues. If none of these components appear to be the problem, then contact a trained technician for further diagnosis and repair.

In some cases, the error code E-11 may indicate a faulty temperature sensor or magnetron. This could be due to a broken wire or contact, or the magnetron may have failed completely. These components will need to be diagnosed and replaced by a qualified technician.

Finally, if the error code persists then your machine may be in need of a firmware update. Contact Samsung customer support for help getting the update. The support team can also help diagnose further issues and troubleshoot.
