# Washing machine wont stop spinning

If your washing machine won't stop spinning, you're probably feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. Don't worry, this is a common problem and one that can be easily fixed. In this blog, we'll discuss some of the potential causes of a washing machine that won't stop spinning and what you can do to solve the issue.

One potential cause of a washing machine that won't stop spinning is a blockage in the drain hose. It's possible that something has become lodged in the hose, preventing the water from draining properly. To check for this, you can remove the drain hose and inspect it for any obstruction. If you find something blocking the hose, use a pair of pliers to remove it and then reattach the hose.

Another potential cause is a faulty lid switch. This is the switch that tells the machine when the lid is closed so it can start running. If the lid switch is damaged or not making contact properly, it can cause the machine to spin continuously. To test this, try manually pushing the switch and see if the machine stops spinning. If it does, you will need to replace the switch as soon as possible.

The timer could also be to blame. The timer controls the length of time that the machine runs and if it has malfunctioned, it could be the reason why your machine isn't stopping. You can test this by manually adjusting the timer and seeing if it makes any difference. If it doesn't, you may need to replace the timer.

Your pump may also be the culprit. The pump is responsible for circulating the water and if it has become clogged or blocked, it could be preventing the machine from stopping. To test this, you can check the pump for any blockages and try running the machine without it. If this solves the problem, you will need to replace the pump as soon as possible.

Finally, a worn-out belt could be causing the problem. The belt is responsible for transferring power from the motor to the drum, and if it has become worn or stretched, it may not be working correctly. If this is the case, you will need to replace the belt in order to get the machine back to spinning correctly.

If your washing machine won't stop spinning, don't despair. With a few simple checks and repairs, you should be able to get it spinning like normal in no time.
