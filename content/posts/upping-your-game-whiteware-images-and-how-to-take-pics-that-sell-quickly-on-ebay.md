## Capturing the Perfect Photos for Your Whiteware Listings on eBay
Getting your whiteware listing noticed and sold quickly on eBay comes down to one key factor – an eye-catching image! Quality, eye-catching images can make all the difference when it comes to a potential buyer selecting your listing from the competition. Learn how to take photos of your appliances that will attract potential buyers and help you to close the deal.

When it comes to photographing appliances for eBay, there are two important steps to consider: picking the correct background and how to best display your appliance in the frame.

### Choosing the Right Background
When it comes to setting up the background of your photo, keep it simple and clutter free. Avoid bright or busy colours as they can take away from the focus of the appliance. A crisp white background is your best bet – it will make the appliance “pop” in the photo and be more visually appealing to those browsing the eBay site.

### Displaying the Appliance
Position your appliance in the frame so that there is enough space around the item and it isn’t overcrowded. Make sure to cover any angles that may affect the buyer’s opinion of the appliance – for example if a part of the pull out handle is missing display your appliance open with the handle out of view. Show off all of the features and display them from different angles.

Taking quality photos of your unwanted whiteware appliances for eBay listings can help them stand out from the competition and sell quicker. By following these simple steps, you can make sure that the photos you take bring potential buyers closer to purchasing your whiteware.
