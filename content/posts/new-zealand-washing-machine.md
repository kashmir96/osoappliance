When it comes to washing machines, New Zealand has plenty of options to choose from. Whether you’re looking for top-of-the-line features or more basic models, there is a washing machine to suit your needs.

When shopping for a new washer, you’ll want to consider the size and capacity that best fits your needs. Smaller machines are great for singles and couples while large capacity machines are perfect for larger families. If you don’t have a lot of space in your laundry room, consider getting a stackable or front loading machine as they take up less space than their top loading counterparts. 

When it comes to features, many modern washing machines offer a variety of helpful options such as energy efficiency settings which help reduce water and electricity costs, quick wash cycles for those times when you need something done quickly, delay start options so you can time your loads around the clock, and many more. Some models also come with anti-allergy treatments designed to remove pet hair and dust mites from clothes which can be beneficial if anyone in your home suffers from allergies. 

Price is another factor that will come into play when choosing the right machine for your needs – some models can be quite expensive so it pays to do a bit of research into what type of washer is best suited for you before making any purchases. Additionally, there are plenty of online retailers offering good deals on washing machines so it pays to shop around before committing to one model. 

All in all, New Zealand has plenty of washing machines available for purchase so no matter what budget or space restrictions you may have there’s sure to be one that fits the bill perfectly!
