A refrigerator thermostat, also known as a fridge thermostat, is an essential component of your refrigerator. Its purpose is to regulate the temperature inside the appliance so that it can maintain a consistent level of cooling. The internal temperature of a refrigerator must remain within a certain range in order for it to stay healthy and efficient. This range is typically between 37°F and 42°F (2°C – 6°C). 

The refrigeration cycle uses four main components: evaporator coil, compressor, condenser coil and expansion valve. The evaporator coil absorbs heat from the inside of the fridge while the compressor compresses gas into liquid form to chill the air in the machine. The condensed gas passes through the condenser coil which removes any remaining heat from the gas before it enters into an expansion valve where it expands back into a colder form for circulation inside your fridge. 

The thermostat on your refrigerator monitors how warm or cold this air is inside your appliance and adjusts its setting accordingly so that things stay at their optimal temperatures at all times. In order to do this accurately, there are two sensors located within your machine – one in near the evaporator coils and one near the condenser coils. These sensors take readings throughout each cycle to ensure that temperatures are maintained consistently within their desired ranges. 

If these temps start getting too high or too low, then they send signals back to a thermostat switch which is connected directly to your compressor motor. This switch will either increase or decrease power depending on whether or not more cooling or heating needs occur in order for things to remain at optimal levels (and not waste energy). 

Overall, understanding how a fridge thermostat works helps you maintain efficiency with your unit's operation by ensuring that temperatures remain consistent throughout its use - saving you money on energy costs over time!
