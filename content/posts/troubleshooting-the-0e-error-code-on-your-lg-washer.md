## Troubleshooting An 0e Error Code On An LG Washer
When you're trying to get laundry done, the last thing you want is for an unknown error code to appear on your LG washer. An 0e error code can bring your laundry to a screeching halt. Read on to understand what the 0e error code is and how to troubleshoot it.

On an LG washer, the 0e error code indicates that the unit has had a motor overload error. This can be caused by a defective motor, a restricted drainage system, a broken water inlet valve, or a problem with the motor control board.

First, check to make sure that the water inlet is not blocked and that the water pressure is correct. If it is, turn off the power to the washer. Then, unplug the washer and inspect the drain pump and hoses for clogs and kinks that could be causing a restriction in the flow of water. 

If you don't find any blockages, you should check the motor to see if it's working correctly. If not, replace the motor. If it is working correctly, check the motor control board for any loose connections or burnt-out parts. If you find any, replace them.

Once you've finished your troubleshooting, you should be able to reset the washer and restart it. If the 0e error code persists, it is likely that you may need to call a qualified technician to diagnose and fix the issue.
