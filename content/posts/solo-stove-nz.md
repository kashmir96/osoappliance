Solo Stove NZ is a popular outdoor stove brand in New Zealand. Solo Stove creates state-of-the-art, lightweight and efficient wood burning stoves for outdoor cooking, camping and adventure trips. These stoves offer an innovative design that allows you to cook with little or no smoke, making them perfect for backcountry cooking. Solo Stove NZ also offers a range of accessories such as fuel packs, pots, pans and other gear to complete your outdoor kitchen. 

What makes Solo Stove so special is their double wall design which creates a primary combustion chamber that burns efficiently while capturing the secondary smoke created by burning wood logs. This smoke is then forced through the double walls creating more efficient burning, thus producing less smoke overall. The dual design also helps to conserve fuel since it doesn’t require as much wood to reach the desired temperature level. This makes it great for saving money on your outdoor adventures while still being able to cook delicious meals! 

Other benefits of using a Solo Stove include portability, easy setup and maintenance and its ability to burn multiple types of fuels such as twigs, sticks or even charcoal briquettes. The lightweight construction also makes it easier to transport and set up in any environment you may be travelling in. Additionally, Solo Stoves are highly affordable when compared to other types of stoves on the market today making them ideal for budget conscious adventurers who are looking for an efficient solution when out in the wilds! 

If you’re looking for an all around reliable camping stove that won’t break your budget then Solo Stove NZ is definitely worth considering! With their innovative dual wall design creating powerful heat while still emitting very little smoke they’re sure to exceed your expectations whether you’re out camping or just enjoying some time at home with family and friends!
