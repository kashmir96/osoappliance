## Locating a Reliable and Used Appliance Repair Shop
Searching for a reliable and trustworthy used appliance repair shop can be a daunting task. You want to make sure that the shop you choose is reputable, as well as reliable and up to date on the latest trends in the industry and safety requirements. Fortunately, there are some simple steps that you can take to ensure that you select the right shop. 

The first thing to do is to ask your friends and family if they know of any good appliance repair shops. They may be able to provide personal referrals of shops that have given them positive experiences in the past. You can also find a wide variety of reviews online, such as on Angie’s List or Yelp. Reading consumer reviews can help you find a reputable shop that has received positive customer feedback for their services. 

Next, research the shops in your area and ask plenty of questions. Be sure to ask about the scope of their services, the quality of their parts, and their experience with the type of appliance that you need repaired. You should also inquire about their warranty policy and if any additional fees are associated with parts or labor. Additionally, be sure to find out if the shop is licensed and insured as an extra measure of security. 

Finally, once you have identified several shops that you are interested in, it’s important to compare their prices. Make sure that you are getting the best deal for both parts and labor that you can. If the shop offers a special deal or promotion, make sure to ask about any additional fees or restrictions that may be associated with it. 

In conclusion, finding a reliable and trustworthy used appliance repair shop can be a challenge. By researching customer reviews, asking plenty of questions, and comparing their prices, you can find a shop that will meet your particular needs.
