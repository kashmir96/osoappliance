## Staying Abreast of Scrap Metal Price Changes

Scrap metal prices vary from month to month, and can often give insight into trends in the industry. Knowing the latest scrap metal prices can be key to making informed decisions about when to sell scrap, and for how much. Staying up to date with market changes also helps individuals, businesses, and manufacturers understand how to budget and plan for the future.

Global market changes, regional and local supply and demand, and more all contribute to fluctuations in scrap prices. Major commodities, such as steel are typically traded overseas, which can have wide ranging effects on prices. Short supply, weather conditions, and production issues all fluctuate the price of commodities, and ultimately the scrap that is left over at the end of the production process.

More locally, the price of scrap is heavily influenced by junk yards or scrap yards. They buy scrap by weight, and typically pay based on the metals that are most commonly sold. Those prices are then used to set the market rate for a particular scrap yard. Prices also vary based on the condition and cleanliness of the scrap. In addition, large bulk orders can typically net higher returns from scrap dealers.

Knowing the current scrap metal prices can help both those looking to sell scrap and those regularly utilizing it, such as appliance manufacturers.
