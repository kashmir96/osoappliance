Are you having trouble with your dryer? If so, one of the first things you should check is the reset button. This small button can be found on the back of the dryer and is usually located near the top. It is usually red or black and looks like a small circle with a dot in the center.

When pressed, the reset button will reset your dryer’s internal settings and potentially fix any issues that may be causing it to malfunction. If your dryer isn’t working properly, it’s always a good idea to press this button first before calling for a repairman.

To reset your dryer, first make sure that it is unplugged from its power source. Then locate the reset button on the back of the machine and press it firmly for about five seconds before releasing it. You may hear a click as you press it, which indicates that it has been successfully activated.

Once you have pressed and released the reset button, plug your dryer back into its power source and turn it on again. Your dryer should now be functioning properly again. However, if it continues to malfunction after pressing the reset button, then you may need to call a repairman to take a look at it. 

The reset button can be a great way to save time and money when dealing with an uncooperative appliance like a dryer. So don’t forget to give it a try before calling for help!
