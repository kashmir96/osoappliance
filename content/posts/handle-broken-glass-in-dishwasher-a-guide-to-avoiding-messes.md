## Avoiding Messes with Broken Glass in a Dishwasher

It happens to the best of us: something slips and falls, and you're left with a mess of broken glass in your dishwasher. Trying to clean it up can be a challenge, and you definitely don't want to put any of it in the wrong place and cause long-term damage to your dishwasher or yourself. Thankfully there are simpler steps you can take to handle broken glass in your dishwasher. 

For starters, step away from the dishwasher immediately and use pliers, a paper towel, or rubber gloves to pick up any larger pieces. There should always be a dustpan and broom if you accidentally dropped broken glass in your dishwasher. Use the pan to collect all of the glass, then pour the pan into a paper bag. 

You should also check the dishwasher filter. Many times the broken glass will get trapped in the filter. To clean out the filter, you must turn off the dishwasher and unplug it. Remove the screws securing the filter and carefully remove it. Dump the broken glass into the paper bag with the other pieces and discard it in the garbage. You may have to even check the drain and pump for broken glass. If you find any, remove it carefully and dump into the garbage.

Once you've collected all of the broken glass, perform a cleaning cycle. Fill up the dishwasher with detergent and hot water and run the empty dishwasher for a full cycle to ensure that all of the glass has been removed. If any glass remains after the cycle is complete, repeat the process until all debris is removed. 

Following these steps will help you clean your dishwasher and make sure it's free from broken glass.
