The Sharp air purifier is a great way to keep your home clean and free from airborne pollutants. But to get the most out of your air purifier, it's important to understand the different accessories that are available for it. Here are some of the most common Sharp air purifier accessories: 

1. Pre-Filters: A pre-filter is a very important accessory for an air purifier because it helps capture large particles like dust, pet hair, and other debris before they can reach the main filters in your unit. Pre-filters also help extend the life of your main filter by trapping these particles before they have a chance to clog up or reduce its efficiency.

2. HEPA Filters: HEPA stands for “High Efficiency Particulate Air” and these filters are designed to trap 99% of all airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns in size - including allergens like dust mites and pollen - from circulating throughout your home's airspace. Many Sharp models come with two or more levels of filtration which can be used together or separately depending on how much filtration you need at any given time. 

3. Carbon Filters: Carbon filters work by adsorbing odors, smoke, and other gases from the air passing through them – making them an ideal choice for people who suffer from allergies or asthma due to environmental pollutants such as tobacco smoke or chemical fumes in their homes. 

4. Ionizers & Ozone Generators: Ionizers use electrical charges to create negative ions which attract positively charged pollutants (like dust and pet dander) like a magnet – trapping them in their path until they’re caught by the filter system on your unit while ozone generators release ozone molecules into the surrounding area which can help break down odors and other organic compounds that may be present in your home's atmosphere without bothering humans at all! 

These are just some of the many accessories available for Sharp air purifiers – so be sure to do research into what type of filtration you need based on what kind of contaminants may be present in your home’s airspace prior to making any purchases!
