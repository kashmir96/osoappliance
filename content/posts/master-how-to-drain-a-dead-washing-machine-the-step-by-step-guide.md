## Master How to Drain a Dead Washing Machine with this Step-by-Step Guide
When your washing machine is on its last legs, one thing must be done: Drain it out. Draining your washing machine is a simple process, but it requires special attention. This step-by-step guide will help you get the job done correctly and safely.

First, you'll need to unplug the washing machine from the wall. Then, you'll have to locate the drain hose connected to the back. Make sure to have something like a bucket or bowl on hand to catch any water that may come from the hose. 

Next, you'll want to disconnect the drain hose from the washing machine and place it into the container. Now that the hose is disconnected, fluid should start to come out of the hose due to gravity. There may be backup water coming out so be sure to place your bucket or bowl farther away than you think you'll need. 

If the water is not flowing, you may need to manually disgorge it from the machine. To do this, use a pair of pliers to remove the drain plug as gently as possible. Be very careful in removing this plug as it may have rusted and will be difficult to remove. 

Once the drain plug is removed, the water should start to flow. Drain the water until a few drops of water comes out. Once the drain process is complete, you can now plug the machine back in and test it to make sure it is working. 

Drainage processes can be daunting tasks, but with the help of this guide, you can now safely and successfully drain a dead washing machine. So donâ€™t hesitate to give it a try!
