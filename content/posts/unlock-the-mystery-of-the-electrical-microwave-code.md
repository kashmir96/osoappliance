## Understanding the Electrical Microwave Code
Intimidating codes and symbols written on electrical microwaves can be a puzzling sight to figure out. Knowing what the different buttons and features of the appliance are capable of can empower users to confidently make use of it. This post will help you understand the electrical microwave code and better equip you to make use of the appliance safely and effectively.

An electrical microwave comes with a range of different features such as Defrost/Reheat, Grill/Convection, Quick Start and Timer. The timer is activated every time a button is pressed to choose the desired setting, and the time range selected is displayed on the main panel of the appliance. With some features, there will also be a power setting which controls the voltage of the microwave oven. This is where the code comes in to play, allowing users to choose the right power level according to their food item.

Most microwave models have different symbols and codes available on the display panel. These are generally known as electrical microwave codes, which indicate the different power levels the microwave can output. The codes are generally composed of digits, indicating the wattage of the power level. Most codes range from 0 to 9, but Watts range from 200 to 1800. For higher wattage levels, the codes may contain 2 or more digits, with the maximum wattage indicated by the highest number. 

These codes are effective in ensuring the safety of users and their food items. Proper understanding of the codes and their power levels can help you set the microwave to the correct power setting depending on the items you want to cook. It also helps to ensure that the microwave does not overheat and that food is cooked properly.

To further prevent overheating or potential damages, it is important to check the care instructions and follow any instructions pertaining to power levels. These instructions may be found either on the appliance itself or in the manual which came with the microwave. Additionally, if you have any questions or concerns, it is important to always contact a professional for advice.

By understanding the electrical microwave code, you can safely and effectively use your microwave. Knowing your appliance's power settings is an essential component of getting the best results when it comes to heating food.
