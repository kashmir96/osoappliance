## Decoding Samsung Error Codes
Most Samsung appliances come with various error codes that can help diagnose and troubleshoot any issues you may have. But, what do these codes mean?

Error codes for Samsung appliances can be located on a sticker inside the refrigerator, on the back of a washer, or inside the oven control panel. The code will consist of 4-7 digits and may include letters. The letters will always be the first two letters of the model number and the numbers will refer to specific components or areas of the appliance.

When a code appears, it usually indicates a problem with the serviceability of the appliance and must be addressed immediately. Fortunately, Samsung provides descriptive information for most of its error codes giving users the ability to troubleshoot on their own. And, if you should need additional help, Samsung also offers support and service on its website.

The ability to decode Samsung error codes is a valuable tool for users of its appliances. By understanding what the code means and taking appropriate steps to resolve the problem, you can ensure that your appliance will service you for many years to come.
