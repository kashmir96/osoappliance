2. Jug Blender Attachment: This attachment makes it possible to blend larger quantities of food at once, such as soups or sauces. It features a powerful motor that can handle tough ingredients with ease while still delivering perfect results every time. You can even puree hot liquids without worrying about damaging the appliance!

3. Whisk Attachment: Perfect for whipping up light meringues or fluffy omelets in no time, this attachment is ideal when you need greater precision than what a chopper/beater would provide. It’s also useful for creating light mayonnaise and other emulsions in smaller batches than what a jug blender could handle effectively.

4 . Blending Beaker: If you want to blend small amounts of food, such as single-serving smoothies or sauces, then this handy beaker is the perfect solution! By attaching it directly to your Braun hand blender, you can achieve excellent results quickly and easily - all without having to dirty another bowl or container!
