Sous vide is a modern cooking technique that involves vacuum-sealing food in a bag and then submerging it into a water bath that’s been heated to a precise temperature. This method of cooking allows you to achieve consistent, evenly cooked results every time. 

When it comes to sous vide steak, the question of how many steaks can you sous-vide at once depends on the size of your equipment and the size of your steaks. If you have a standard-size pot or large stockpot and are using 6 oz. steaks, then it’s possible to fit up to four steaks in the pot at once. If you double up the steaks in two bags, then you could possibly fit even more than four in there. 

However, if your sous vide equipment isn’t large enough for multiple full-size steaks (or if you want to cook smaller portions), then it may be necessary to cut them into smaller pieces before they can be cooked together. For example, if your sous vide setup can only accommodate one 6 oz steak at a time, then cutting each steak into two equal parts would allow for two 4 oz portions per bag so that twice as many pieces could fit in at once without overcrowding! 

No matter what size of steak or how much space is available for cooking them all together, always remember that when sous viding steak (or any other type of meat) it’s important not let them overlap too much or get too close together as this will result in uneven heating and inconsistent results from one piece to another. 

In conclusion, while there is no exact answer as to how many steaks can be cooked simultaneously with sous vide since this can vary depending on the size of both your equipment and the cuts themselves; with careful planning and consideration for each individual piece's amount of space needed for even heating/cooking times - most people should find success fitting between 2 - 4 full-size steaks at once!
