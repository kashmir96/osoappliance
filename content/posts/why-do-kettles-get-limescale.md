Limescale is a chalky white deposit that builds up inside kettles and is caused by the build-up of mineral deposits from hard water. Hard water contains high levels of calcium and magnesium which, when heated, form a scale known as limescale. This can make it difficult to heat water effectively and can cause damage to the interior of your kettle over time. 

The main reason why kettles get limescale is because they are regularly exposed to hard water. Hard water contains high levels of minerals like calcium and magnesium which, when heated, form a scale known as limescale. This build up reduces the efficiency of your kettle as it takes longer to heat water effectively. Limescale can also cause damage to the interior of your kettle over time if not removed regularly. 

Limescale can be prevented by using filtered or softened water in your kettle or using a descaling product which will help remove existing limescale build-up from its walls or heating elements. Itâ€™s also important to clean out the inside of your kettle regularly with a damp cloth or vinegar solution in order to prevent any further build-up from occurring in the future. By following these tips you should be able to keep your kettle free from limescale for many years!
