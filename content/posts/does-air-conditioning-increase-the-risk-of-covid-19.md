The novel coronavirus pandemic has caused many people to wonder if air conditioning can increase their risk of contracting COVID-19. In short, the answer is probably. That said, there is still much to learn about the virus and how it spreads, so the potential risk associated with air conditioning should be weighed against other preventative measures.

Air conditioning can increase your risk of contracting COVID-19 in two ways. First, air conditioners can spread airborne particles, such as droplets from an infected person’s cough or sneeze. This is especially true if the air conditioner isn’t regularly maintained and filters aren’t changed. Second, air conditioners can recirculate the same air throughout a building or room. This means that if one person in a space has COVID-19, their droplets could be circulated to other people in the same space who may not have been exposed yet.

However, it’s important to note that there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of exposure when using an air conditioner during this pandemic. First, ensure that your AC is serviced regularly and its filters are changed often. Second, consider using portable HEPA filters to improve indoor air quality while reducing airborne particles from contaminating the space further. Finally, practice social distancing when possible and wear face coverings when indoors with others who don’t live in your household for added protection against COVID-19 transmission through contaminated droplets circulated by an AC system.

Overall, while it is possible for an AC system to increase one's risk of contracting COVID-19 due to its ability to spread aerosols from an infected person's cough or sneeze as well as circulate contaminated droplets throughout a building or room; however following proper maintenance procedures and implementing preventive measures like social distancing and wearing face coverings when indoors with others outside of your household should help reduce this risk significantly
