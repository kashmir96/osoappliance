If you're looking for a way to save time and money on laundry, consider investing in a washing machine with dryer. Washing machines with dryers are two-in-one appliances that allow you to both wash and dry your clothes in one efficient cycle. This eliminates the need for purchasing a separate washer and dryer, which can be costly. Not only do these machines save you time, but they also help you save money on energy bills since their combined functions use less electricity than if you were to run two separate machines.

When shopping for a washing machine with dryer, it is important to consider all of your needs and preferences. You will want to think about size, capacity, type of wash cycle, features like steam or sanitizing cycles, and price. The size of the machine is important because it should fit into the space available in your home or laundry room. Capacity refers to how much laundry it can hold at once; the larger the capacity, the more clothes it can wash or dry at once. Additionally, different types of wash cycles offer various levels of cleaning depending on what type of fabrics and garments are being washed or dried. Features such as steam and sanitizing cycles are helpful for killing germs and allergens while also making sure every inch of fabric gets cleaned thoroughly. 

The price of a washing machine with dryer depends on many factors including brand name, features included in the model, type of material used in construction (plastic or metal), energy efficiency rating (EER), etc. Generally speaking, these machines range from around $600-$2000 depending on all these factors mentioned above. It is important to do some research before making a purchase so that you get the best value for your money! 

Overall, investing in a washing machine with dryer is an excellent way to save time while also saving money on energy bills each month! With so many different models available today at varying prices points, there is sure to be one that fits within your budget and meets all your needs perfectly!
