If your oven isn’t warming up, it can be a frustrating and potentially dangerous situation. Before you call a repairman or start shopping for a new oven, it’s important to understand the potential causes of an oven that won’t heat up and what you can do to fix it. 

One of the most common causes for an oven not heating up is a blown thermal fuse. The thermal fuse is a safety device designed to protect the oven from overheating. If the thermal fuse has blown, it will need to be replaced before the oven will heat up again. 

Another common cause of an oven not heating is a faulty igniter. The igniter is responsible for lighting the gas in gas ovens or heating the element in electric ovens. If the igniter is not working properly, it may be weak or have broken filaments, preventing it from producing enough heat to light or ignite the gas or heat up the element. 

In some cases, an oven won’t heat up due to a malfunctioning control board or thermostat. The control board regulates all of the functions of your oven, including temperature control and timing functions. If there is an issue with your control board or thermostat, you may need to replace them in order for your oven to work properly again. 

Finally, if your oven isn’t heating up due to a lack of power, you may need to check that all of your connections are secure and that there are no tripped circuit breakers in your home’s electrical panel. 

If none of these solutions solve your problem, then it might be time to call in a professional repairman or buy a new oven altogether!
