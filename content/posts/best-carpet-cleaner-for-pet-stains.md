If you have pets, you know that one of the worst problems to deal with is pet stains on the carpet. Not only can these stubborn spots be embarrassing, but they can also be difficult to remove if not treated properly. Thankfully, there are a variety of products on the market designed specifically for cleaning pet stains on carpets. So which is the best carpet cleaner for pet stains? 

The most important thing to consider when selecting a carpet cleaner for pet stains is its effectiveness. Look for cleaners specifically formulated to tackle tough pet messes as they often contain ingredients geared towards treating tough odors and stains left behind by pets. Some of these ingredients include enzymes and odor neutralizers that break down proteins and other organic matter in order to loosen and eliminate the source of unwanted smells or discolorations. Also look for products that contain oxygen boosters, which help lift dirt from deep within carpets while simultaneously brightening colors and restoring natural fibers back to their original condition. 

In addition to being effective, it's also important that your chosen cleaner be safe for use around pets as well as family members who may have allergies or sensitivities. Eco-friendly formulas are ideal here since they don't contain harsh chemicals or fumes that could irritate your pets or family members' respiratory systems. 

Once you've found an effective yet safe product, it's time to apply it correctly in order to get maximum results from your cleaning efforts. To do this, always start by blotting up any excess liquid residue with a clean cloth before applying your chosen solution directly onto the affected area (or adjacent areas). Work in small sections at a time using gentle circular motions until all visible traces of dirt have been removed; then vacuum up dry residue using a wet/dry vacuum cleaner if necessary before allowing everything time to dry completely before walking on it again (or placing furniture back). 

In conclusion, finding an effective yet safe product is key when selecting the best carpet cleaner for pet stains; look for those containing enzymes and odor neutralizers along with oxygen boosters in order to effectively tackle even tough messes left behind by furry friends!
