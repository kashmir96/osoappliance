## Make Sense of LG Washing Machine Error Code 03

Have you tackled the dreaded error code 03 on your LG washing machine? While it might seem intimidating, deciphering this error code is not as complicated as it might seem. This issue can typically be resolved with a few simple steps. Read on to understand what error 03 means, and how to get your LG washing machine back on track.

When your LG washing machine displays error code 03, it is usually caused by a slow draining issue. It is possible that something is blocking the drain hose, or there is too much laundry being washed at once. The first step is to open your LG washing machines door, and ensure that nothing is blocking the drain hose. Then, make sure that your laundry load is not too big for the washing machine. If you are still experiencing this issue after removing any blockages, then you will need to check the drain pump filter for any trapped lint or other debris.

It is also possible that the drain pump motor itself may have a problem. If you have checked the filter and the draining flow is still slow, then you will most likely need to replace the drain pump motor. If you are unfamiliar with this process, then you should contact a professional.
