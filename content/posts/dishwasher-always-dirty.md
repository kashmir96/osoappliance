If your dishwasher is always dirty, you’re not alone. Many homeowners struggle with this issue, but the good news is that there are a few simple steps you can take to get your dishwasher back in working order. 

First, make sure you’re using the right detergent. Some dishwasher detergents are designed specifically for hard water, while others are designed for soft water. If you’re not sure which type of detergent to use, check the instructions on the package. 

Second, make sure you’re using the right amount of detergent. Too much detergent can leave behind a residue that can make your dishes look dirty. If you’re using too much detergent, try reducing the amount you use. 

Third, make sure you’re pre-rinsing your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. This will help remove any food particles that could be causing your dishwasher to become dirty. 

Fourth, make sure you’re cleaning the dishwasher itself. Over time, food particles and grease can build up inside the dishwasher, making it difficult for the water to circulate properly. To clean the dishwasher, use a soft cloth and a mild detergent to wipe down the interior. 

Finally, make sure you’re running the dishwasher on a regular basis. If you don’t use the dishwasher often, the water can become stagnant, which can lead to the buildup of dirt and grime. 

By following these simple steps, you should be able to get your dishwasher back in working order. If you’re still having trouble, it may be time to call a professional.
