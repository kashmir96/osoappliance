## Risk of Death in a Washing Machine - Don't Take the Chance

There have been instances of deaths due to immersion in washing machines. Every year, a handful of people manage to suffer fatal drownings in large tubs of water: including washing machines. It is important to note that this can and does happen, and as such, extra care should be taken when using these appliances to ensure you and your family's safety.

In most cases, these deaths occur due to curiosity or playfulness. Often a child will climb inside the washing machine looking for a way to play, or an adult may take a bath in a washing machine for whatever reason. It is very dangerous in either case, and the risk of drowning or electric shock should be taken into consideration before taking such a risk.

Even in the event that nobody is in the washing machine, it is also important to keep in mind the risk of electric shock when around any appliance that uses water. As with any appliance, it should be regularly inspected and any signs of leaking or water damage should be immediately addressed. Additionally, regular maintenance and safety checks should be performed by a professional appliance technician to further protect yourself and your family.

Risks of death in the washing machine are largely preventable. It is important to take extra care when using these appliances, and to make sure that children do not play around them or in them. Proper inspections and maintenance should also be carried out to ensure that the risk of electric shock is minimized. It is also important to stay vigilant and keep others aware of the potential danger to help minimize the risk of a fatal occurrence.

By being aware of the risks associated with washing machines, and taking extra care to keep yourself and your family safe, you can dramatically reduce the potential danger of a potentially fatal washing machine accident.
