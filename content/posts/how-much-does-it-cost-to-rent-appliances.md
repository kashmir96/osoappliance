When it comes to renting appliances, the cost can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. From the type of appliance rented to whether or not you need installation or delivery services, there is no universal answer when it comes to how much you will have to pay.

To start with, rental costs for appliances will depend on the type and brand of appliance being rented. For example, basic units like refrigerators, dishwashers and ovens typically range from $20 - $60 per month for a standard-sized unit. Bigger and more advanced models may cost more, up to around $200 per month for high-end luxury models. 

If you are renting an appliance that requires professional installation or delivery services, these will add extra costs onto your total rental fee. Installation fees can range from as little as $50 for smaller appliances up to several hundred dollars depending on the complexity of the job. Delivery fees are usually based on distance but typically start at around $30 - $50 per item depending on your location and if any special requirements need to be taken into consideration (e.g stairs). 

Finally, some companies may also offer ‘rent-to-own’ options that allow you to buy certain appliances after completing a certain number of rental payments. In this case, additional fees such as taxes and administrative charges will have to be factored in as well. 

In conclusion, when it comes to determining how much it will cost you rent an appliance there is no simple answer due in part due due the numerous factors that come into play such as size/brand/type of appliance as well as any related services like installation or delivery which can significantly increase your overall costs if required . It is important therefore do research ahead of time so that you are aware of all associated costs before signing any contracts with any particular company
