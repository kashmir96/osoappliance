## What to Do When Your Washing Machine Breaks 

When our washing machine quits, most of us can feel like we’re stuck in a mob of the dead—we’ve got clothes to wash, but no machine to do the job. What can we do to get back to our non-smelly selves?

First thing’s first—diagnosing the issue. Are you getting error codes? Is water leaking? If any of these issues are occurring, it’s important that you turn off the power and take a look at the manual to try to get an idea of what might be going on. 

If you’re still in the dark, it’s time to make a call. Many washers come with service plans that include free repair calls, and, depending on your washer's age, you may be able to find the contact info for a service technician in the manufacturers’ warranty. Otherwise, there are many appliance repair technicians out there who specialize in washers and are available in many different parts of the country. 

No matter the issue, an experienced appliance repair technician can diagnose the issue and repair it, restoring your washer back to its former glory and ensuring it will last for many years to come. 

If you’re in need of a reliable repair technician to help bring your washing machine back to life, take a look at our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). Finding the a service technician in your area has never been easier. 

The next time your washer quits, don’t stay stuck in a mob of the dead—call a repair technician to get the job done.
