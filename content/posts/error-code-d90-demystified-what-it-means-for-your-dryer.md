## Error Code D90: What it Means for Your Dryer
If you are like most homeowners, you don't think twice about your clothes dryer until it stops working. But when it does, you might see something like this on its settings display: error code D90. So, what is error code D90 and how can you get your dryer working again? This blog explains everything you need to know about error code D90 and how to resolve the issue.

Error code D90 is a manufacturers' specific error code that indicates the dryer's temperature sensor has detected a problem with the dryer's heating system. This could mean the dryer is having trouble maintaining the set temperature or that abnormal temperatures have been detected.

The first thing you'll want to do is manually reset the dryer's settings. Most models have a reset button that you can press to reset the machine. If this does not work and the D90 error code persists, then you will likely need to repair or replace the dryer's heating element. 

The good news is that replacing the heating element is easier and less expensive than it sounds. In fact, with the right tools and simple instructions, it's a relatively straightforward process. Many manufacturers also offer do-it-yourself repair kits that contain all of the necessary components and instructions. 

The important thing to remember is that if you determine that error code D90 is the result of a malfunctioning heating element, then you will want to replace it right away. Not doing so could lead to more serious and more costly problems. 

So, if your dryer is displaying error code D90, the message is clear: it's time to take action!
