## Understanding What the Different Laundry Symbols Mean
Do you ever get confused when you look at the care tags inside your clothing? Understanding what all the symbols mean can often seem like a daunting task. But don’t worry, help is at hand! In this blog post we’ll go through the basics of understanding laundry symbols.

Laundry symbols are a collection of images and/or words used on clothing labels or care tags attached to clothing, towels and bedding. By following the instructions on these tags, you can ensure that your clothes stay in the best possible condition.

Each of the symbols stands for a different type of care. For instance, the iron symbol indicates that an item should be ironed, whilst the dot symbol is an indication of how hot to set your iron. So, the higher the number of dots, the hotter the temperature should be set. Other symbols include a hand for hand-washing, a machine for machine-washing, a circle for dry-cleaning and so on. 

Another thing to look out for are the lines and crosses. Crosses indicate that the item should not be washed by either machine or hand, and lines indicate that the item should not be bleached. It is also important that the symbols on the clothing tag are followed correctly; otherwise the item can become damaged and unusable.

It is also important to remember that each symbol is unique and represents a certain type of care. However, if you are unsure of what a certain symbol means or how to use it, it is always best to check either the clothing label or a website which explains laundry symbols and their meanings.

Understanding laundry symbols can help you to keep your clothes clean and in the best possible condition. By following the symbols correctly, you can ensure that your clothes last longer and look the way you intended.
