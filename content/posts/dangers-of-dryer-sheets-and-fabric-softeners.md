When it comes to doing laundry, dryer sheets and fabric softeners are often seen as essential items. But these products can be dangerous for both your health and the environment. In this blog, we’ll discuss the potential dangers associated with dryer sheets and fabric softeners so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not they are right for you. 

First, let’s start with dryer sheets. Dryer sheets contain a variety of chemicals including synthetic fragrances, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), petroleum-based oils, and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). VOCs are known to cause eye irritation, respiratory problems such as asthma attacks, headaches, nausea and more serious long-term effects such as cancer. QACs have been linked to skin irritation and allergic reactions in some individuals. The petroleum-based oils used in dryer sheets can also leave a waxy residue on clothes that is difficult to remove. 

Fabric softeners also contain chemicals like VOCs which have been linked to similar health risks as mentioned above. Additionally, fabric softeners leave a chemical residue on clothing which can irritate sensitive skin when it comes into contact with perspiration or other natural body fluids like saliva from babies or young children who may put their hands in their mouths after touching treated clothing or bedding materials. 

The environmental impacts of using dryer sheets and fabric softeners should also be considered when making a decision about whether or not to use them regularly during laundry cycles. Both products contain chemicals that enter waterways through wastewater treatment plants when they are washed down the drain during laundry cycles which can pollute water sources and harm local ecosystems due to bioaccumulation of these toxins in aquatic life over time if not properly filtered out by sewage systems before entering bodies of water such as rivers or streams nearby homes where these products are being used regularly.. 

In conclusion, while using dryer sheets and fabric softener may make your clothes smell nice for a short period of time - the potential risks posed by exposure to the chemicals contained within them should be carefully weighed against any short term benefits before deciding whether or not they should be included in your regular laundry routine moving forward!
