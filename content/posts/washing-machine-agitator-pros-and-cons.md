If you’re in the market for a new washing machine, one of the biggest decisions you’ll have to make is between a machine with an agitator and one without. While both types work well, each has its own pros and cons. 

The main benefit of an agitator is that it provides more effective cleaning power. The agitator moves clothes around during the wash cycle, which helps to dislodge dirt and other particles from fabric fibers. This movement also helps to better distribute detergent throughout the wash load for more thorough cleaning results. Agitators are also great for washing large items like comforters or blankets that need extra scrubbing power. 

On the downside, an agitator takes up more space inside your washer than a non-agitator model does, leaving less room for larger items like blankets or comforters or multiple smaller items like towels and jeans. Additionally, some people find that agitators can be rough on delicate fabrics or delicate clothing items with embellishments such as rhinestones or sequins by causing them to snag on the agitating mechanism. 

Overall, while there are some downsides to using a washing machine with an agitator, they offer superior cleaning performance compared to non-agitated models and can be great if you have large items you need cleaned frequently or tough stains that require extra scrubbing power.
