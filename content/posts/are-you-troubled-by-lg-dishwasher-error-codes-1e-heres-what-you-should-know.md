## Troubled by LG Dishwasher Error Code 1E?
Whether you're using a dishwasher to save time in the kitchen or you rely on it to assist with larger clean-up jobs, you want it to work properly. When you find an error code 1E on an LG dishwasher, it can cause some anxiety. Learning more about this common error code is key for efficient troubleshooting and repairs. 

Error code 1E means the dishwasher's motor is not spinning. This code is usually caused by either a wiring issue or a lack of water circulation within the washer. Therefore, you'll need to check the dishwasher's water line, as well as the wiring harness. 

First, disconnect the power to the dishwasher from both its power supply and the outlet. Then, try to see if the motor is damaged or has been disconnected. You should also inspect the wiring harness for any loose connections. 

If this inspection proves unsuccessful, you may need to remove the dishwasher's cover and check the water line. Look for any blockages in the hose that may be hindering the water flow. Loose connections can lead to water leakage, so make sure all connections to the water line are secure and tight. 

Finally, inspect the water inlet valve. This component is typically located near the water inlet hose and helps regulate water flow into the dishwasher. If this valve is malfunctioning, it'll impede water flow, causing error code 1E. 

If after all these checks, the error code persists, you may need to call a professional for additional help. A qualified technician can properly diagnose and repair LG dishwasher error code 1E.
