## Heater Safety: Know the Potential Risks

Heaters can be a great way to keep your home cozy, but they come with a few dangers that you should be aware of. From fire hazards to health risks, there are many potential safety concerns when it comes to using heaters in the home. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the dangers of using a heater and what safety precautions you should take.

The most obvious danger of using a heater is the risk of fire or burns. Heaters can produce sparks or cause flammable objects such as curtains and furniture to catch fire. To prevent fires, keep electric heaters at least three feet away from curtains, furniture, bedding, and other combustible materials. Make sure you check the cord for cracks or fraying and always unplug the heater when it is not in use. For gas or propane heaters, make sure you use a certified technician to install the unit and have it annually inspected.

Another potential safety issue with heaters is carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that can be emitted from poorly ventilated heaters. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, dizziness, and vomiting, so if you experience these symptoms, evacuate the space and get medical attention. To stay safe, make sure that your heater is adequately ventilated and properly installed by a certified technician.

Finally, keep in mind that some heaters can become hot to the touch, which could lead to accidental burns. Do not touch the heater or leave objects resting against it, and keep children and pets away from it.

Heaters can be an effective way to keep your home warm, but it’s important to be aware of the potential dangers that come along with them. Make sure you know the safety precautions to take to reduce the risk of fire, carbon monoxide poisoning, and burns. If you have questions or any concerns about the safety of your heater, contact a certified appliance repair technician.
