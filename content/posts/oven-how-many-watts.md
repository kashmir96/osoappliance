When it comes to energy consumption, the wattage of an oven can vary greatly depending on the type and size of oven you have. Generally speaking, a standard electric oven will use between 1,200 and 2,400 watts of power when in use. This is equivalent to 10 to 20 amps at 120 volts. 

Gas ovens typically require less power than electric ovens, using only about half as much energy. A gas oven will typically require between 500 and 1,000 watts of power when in use. This is equivalent to 4 to 8 amps at 120 volts. 

Convection ovens are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to cook food more quickly and evenly than traditional ovens. Convection ovens use a fan to circulate hot air around the food, which helps it cook faster and more evenly. Convection ovens typically require more power than traditional electric or gas ovens, usually between 1,800 and 3,000 watts of power when in use. This is equivalent to 15 to 25 amps at 120 volts. 

If you’re looking for an energy-efficient option for your kitchen, consider investing in an induction cooktop instead of an oven. Induction cooktops are incredibly efficient because they don’t require any preheating time and they only heat the area directly beneath the pot or pan being used. Induction cooktops usually require between 800 and 2,400 watts of power when in use. This is equivalent to 6 to 20 amps at 120 volts. 

No matter what type of cooking appliance you choose for your kitchen, it’s important to know how much power it requires so that you can make sure your electrical system can handle the load safely and efficiently.
