## Fixing a Washing Machine Error Code

Washing machines, like other household appliances, are meant to make life a bit easier. Unfortunately, when an error code pops up, all of that convenience is tossed out the window. Recently, my washing machine had an error code show up, and I think my experience of fixing it may be helpful to others who find themselves in a similar situation. 

The error code I had was most likely related to a wiring issue. After some troubleshooting, I discovered that my washing machine's main control board needed to be replaced. To start the process, I unplugged the washing machine and disconnected the wiring harness connections, then removed the screws around the control board and replaced it with a new one. The error code then cleared, and the washing machine was again able to start up.

This was not a particularly difficult fix. If a washing machine error code does show up, itâ€™s probably best to remain calm and slowly troubleshoot the possible underlying issues. Your best bet to avoid any long-term damage or pricey repairs is to double-check any wiring issues and replace any of the necessary parts, like a control board, as soon as possible. 

To make narrowing down any potential underlying issues a bit simpler for you, it may be useful to check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). After all, the first step to fixing an error code is to identify what it actually means.
