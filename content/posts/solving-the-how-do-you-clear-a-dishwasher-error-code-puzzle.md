## Clearing Dishwasher Error Codes

Have you ever noticed that a red light on the dishwasher is flashing or staying lit up? This indicates an appliance error code. Many consumers and households experience these codes but don't know how to decipher the code or what to do with it. This guide will provide key steps to follow in order to clear a dishwasher error code.

Many dishwasher error codes are connected to the electronic display, sensor, or motor on the appliance. To clear the error code, first check to make sure that everything is plugged in and the circuit breaker has not tripped. If the error code persists, try restarting the appliance by unplugging it for several minutes, then plug it back in and restart the laundering cycle. If this still does not clear the error code, then the best recommendation is to call a professional technician as the error code could be more serious.

Various error codes convey different meanings for the owner and repairmen. Sometimes resetting the dishwasher does clear the error code, but it could mean that a part on the appliance is not working correctly and will need to be replaced. A technician may be needed to help identify the exact error code and recommend a solution to the owner.

To get the most out of your dishwasher, it is essential to clear the error codes present. To clear the error code, check to make sure of the basics such as the power connection and the circuit breaker, then reset the appliance by unplugging it then plugging it back in. If, in the end, this is all unsuccessful, you should call a professional technician to get to the bottom of the error code.
