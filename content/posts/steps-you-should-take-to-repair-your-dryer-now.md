## Learn How to Resolve Common Dryer Troubles
With proper maintenance, a dryer should last 10 to 16 years, but sometimes breakdowns still happen. Learning how to perform basic repairs or to identify the issue can be a helpful first step and save you time and money. 

### Check the Power Source
The first step to take is to examine the power source. Is the dryer plug correctly connected to the outlet? If so, check if the outlet is getting power. Once you have done this, proceed to the next step. 

### Assess the Problem
Some common issues with dryers include clothing not heating up, moisture not exiting the exhaust, or failure to tumble. Knowing what the problem is before starting repairs can help determine which step to take next.

### Clean the Lint Trap
For most dryers, the lint trap is typically located either on the bottom or the side. lint buildup can prevent appropriate air flow, leading to longer drying cycles. Even if you do not see any visible lint, use a vacuum hose or something similar to remove any debris that could obstruct the air flow. 

### Replace the Belt
When a drum stops spinning, it's likely that the dryer's belt has broken or stretched. Replacing the belt requires expertise and specific tools, so if you are not comfortable performing this repair, it may be best to consult a professional.

### Final Steps
If all of your checks, cleaning, and potential replacements did not resolve the issue, you may need to replace some components. With the proper tools and parts, you may be able to execute the repair on your own. If you don't feel comfortable performing the repair, consider consulting a professional. At [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians), you can find a local technician to help you get your issues resolved correctly. 

The best way to avoid many dryer repairs is to practice diligent maintenance. Make sure to clean the lint trap, as well as check the vent from the dryer to the outside every few months. Additionally, check the hose for any visible signs of wear or damage and replace it as needed. 

If your dryer is not performing correctly, completing a series of checks and making small replacements can help you resolve the issue and get your appliance back up and running. However, if you need help, there are professional and experienced repair technicians who can assist you in restoring your dryer.

## Steps to Repair Your Dryer

### What should I do if my dryer won't turn on?
If your dryer won't turn on, the first thing to do is to check the power. Make sure the switch that turns on the power to the dryer is switched to the “on” position. Check to make sure that the power cord is firmly plugged into the wall and the dryer.

### How do I test if my dryer is getting power?
Check the circuit breaker box and make sure that the circuit breaker hasn't been tripped. You can also use a voltage tester to check the power outlet for power.

### What are some common causes for a dryer not heating?
One common cause for a dryer not heating is a broken thermal fuse. A faulty drive motor or a clogged dryer vent can also cause a dryer not to heat.

### How can I check to see if my dryer's heating element is functioning correctly?
You can use a multimeter to check the continuity of the heating element. This can show if there is a broken connection or other problems with the heating element.

### How can I check my dryer vent to make sure it isn't clogged?
You can check the exhaust vent of the dryer to make sure it is clear of lint or other debris. You can also use a vacuum cleaner to clean out the exhaust vent.
