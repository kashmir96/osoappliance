## Is it Worth Spending Money to Repair a 7 Year Old Washing Machine?
Deciding whether to repair a washing machine or purchase a new one is a common problem for most households. Replacing a broken appliance is a costly decision and sometimes repairs may require the same amount of money or more. This article will help to answer the question if it's worth repairing a 7 year old washing machine.

The most important factor when considering a repair of an old washing machine is cost. After seven years, the cost of parts and labor associated with a repair may be more expensive than purchasing a new machine. Because machines are designed to last an average of eight to ten years, some repairs may not be worth investing in after seven years. It is always important to compare the cost of the repair to the cost of purchasing a new washing machine. 

Another factor to consider is the availability of compatible parts for your model. It is important to check a reliable source for compatible parts for the machine. Many times, the parts used during manufacturing may have been discontinued, limiting the ability to repair the machine. 

In some cases, a washing machine that is more than seven years old may be worth repairing if the repairs are straight forward. Simple repairs like replacing worn belts and hoses may be worth doing. Pipe and drainage issues may be able to be resolved by replacing fittings. This can extend the life expectancy of the machine and is an affordable option when parts are available. 

It's important to assess all of the available options before making a final decision. Generally speaking, the cost of repairing an older washing machine could be on par with the cost of purchasing a new unit. In some cases, repairs may be more affordable and extend the life of the washing machine. Ultimately, each situation is different and cost will be the determining factor.
