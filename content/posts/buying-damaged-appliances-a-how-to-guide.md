## Purchasing Pre-Owned Appliances: A How-To Guide 
Whether you're replacing existing units in an existing home, outfitting a new home from scratch, or simply looking for a cost-effective upgrade to fit a friendlier budget, buying damaged appliances can be a great way to save money. Here is a how-to guide for purchasing pre-owned appliances that may have experienced some wear and tear. 

The first step is to make sure you understand the exact nature of the damage the appliance has experienced. This could mean researching the previous owner’s usage and maintenance or bringing in a professional to assess the damage and make sure that it can be fixed without further issues. It is important to determine whether or not a unit can be successfully fixed or must be eliminated from consideration. 

The next step is to determine if the desired features are present in the damaged appliance. Make sure to take into account all desired features, such as energy efficiency, ease of use, and weight when evaluating the appliance. This will help ensure that the appliance does not have issues that may interfere with its functioning in the future. 

Once the damage and desired features are established, consider the cost of repair versus the cost of a new appliance. Repairing the damaged appliance will often be less expensive than buying a new one. A reputable repair shop should have the experience to offer estimates that allow you to weigh the cost of repair against the cost of starting fresh. 

Finally, make sure to research the manufacturer's warranty and any additional coverage that may be available. While nowadays extended warranties and product protection plans are commonplace, it is still a good idea to research the manufacturer's warranty and see what is included in a warranty before finalizing your purchase. 

Buying damaged appliances can be an excellent way to get premium features and quality, without having to pay the full price. By researching the damage, the features, and the cost, you can be sure you are getting a reliable appliance at a reasonable price.
