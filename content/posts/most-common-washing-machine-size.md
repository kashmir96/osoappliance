Washing machines come in a variety of sizes and configurations, but the most common size is the traditional top-loading washer. Top-loading washers are typically between three and four feet wide, two to three feet deep, and approximately two feet tall when closed. These dimensions are ideal for fitting into most standard laundry rooms or closets without taking up too much space.

Front-load washers are also popular, although they tend to be a bit larger than their top-loading counterparts. A typical front-load washer can range from 28 inches wide to 34 inches wide, depending on the model and brand. These models can also be two to three feet deep and two to three feet tall when closed. These dimensions allow them to fit into smaller spaces than top-loaders but may require you to make some adjustments if you plan on installing it in an existing laundry room or closet.

While some people opt for more compact models like portable or stacked units, these sizes aren't as common as full-size machines because of their limited capacity and functionality compared to traditional ones. Portable units usually range from 18 inches high by 17 inches wide while stacked units are slightly larger at around 24 inches high by 23 inches wide. Depending on your specific needs, either option could be ideal if you have limited space available in your home for a washing machine but still want full functionality from it.
