## Resetting Your LG Fridge: How to Do it the Correct Way
Maintaining the health of your LG refrigerator is important to keep it running in its best condition. Resetting it is a critical part of this maintenance and this article provides helpful steps to reset your LG refrigerator correctly. 

When resetting an LG refrigerator, it is important to minimize the risks to the electronics and hardware. Shutting off the power properly will protect from potential surges and other power-related issues that can cause your LG refrigerator to malfunction. To ensure a safe and effective reset, always remember the following: 

1. Always disconnect the power before unplugging your appliance. To ensure a successful reset, the power must be turned off completely. 

2. Unplug the unit for a full minute and then plug it back in. This will hard reset the refrigerator and kickstart the reset process.

3. If the reset fails after a minute, you may need to flush the internal line in order to fully reset the system. To do this: 

 - Locate the water line behind the refrigerator and disconnect it from the refrigerator.
- Turn on the faucet that runs to the refrigerator until clear water comes out. This will flush the internal line of any dirt and debris. 
- Reconnect the water line and wait a few minutes for it to prime. 
- During this wait time, you can also remove the lower panel adjacent to the water line and check it visually for any damage or blockage. 
- Once the line is clear, reattach the panel, plug the refrigerator back in, turn it on, and you should be all set. 

After all of these steps are completed, you should have successfully reset your LG refrigerator.
