## My Beko Washing Machine Failed To Complete a Cycle

Are you noticing that your Beko washing machine isn’t completing a full cycle? You may be worried and unsure of why this is happening. Before you break out the toolkit and start tinkering, it’s important to discover the underlying cause behind an unfinished cycle. 

Most issues with a washing machine can be attributed to a faulty sensor, common malfunctioning parts, or incorrect settings. The most common issues that will cause an unfinished cycle are a broken belt, a failing motor, or a water pressure switch that is stuck in the on position and is failing to reset. In addition to the mechanical components, human error can cause a washing cycle to be indefinitely paused or aborted. If the door is opened in the middle of a cycle, the many safety features will come into play and suspend the cycle. 

If the cause of the unfinished cycle issue is still unknown, Beko error codes are a great place to start. These codes can identify what the issue is and provide steps to rectify the problem. For example, a code E02 signals an issue with the water inflow system and a code E10 signals an issue with the water drainage. You can learn more about Beko Error Codes in our Comprehensive Appliance Error Code Glossary.

Unfinished cycles can be disruptive to the cycle of life, but once the underlying cause has been identified, the issue can usually be solved with minimal effort. Some of the problems can be fixed by resetting the machine and allowing a new cycle to start. However, more complex issues require more in-depth troubleshooting and possibly a repair. Regardless of the cause of an unfinished cycle, you can use the information provided above to assess the problem and take the next step.

Don’t let an unfinished cycle get you down. If you’re unsure of the exact cause, our Comprehensive Appliance Error Code Glossary is a great place to start. There you’ll find definitions of common Beko error codes and instructions on how to diagnose and repair them. With the right knowledge, you can tackle the unfinished cycle problem without stress or delay.
