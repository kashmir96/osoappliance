## Are Laundromats Sanitary: A Look at Laundry Hygiene Standards
 
With the current COVID-19 pandemic, people have been more vigilant than ever when it comes to hygiene. But how do we know that laundromats are abiding by necessary hygiene standards? 
 
The CDC and WHO recommend frequent handwashing and sanitizing of surfaces, but what about laundry? According to the experts, laundering clothes can help reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases. Hot water combined with detergent helps detach and destroy disease-causing organisms from clothing. However, this doesn’t mean that all laundromats are necessarily sanitary. 

When using a public laundromat, it is important to consider your safety first. Many laundromats offer laundry carts and baskets for carrying loads in and out of the facility that should be wiped down with a sanitizing cloth beforehand to prevent spread of germs or illness caused by unclean surfaces. In addition, pay attention to the machines themselves; if any look dirty or smell musty they should be avoided until they have been successfully cleaned or replaced altogether. Lastly, ensure you are wearing protective gloves while you handle your clothes in order to minimize contact with germs on other items in the environment as well as on potentially soiled clothing items themselves. 

Although public laundromats may not always guarantee absolute cleanliness due to shared use by multiple customers over short amounts of time, there is an alternative option available for those who want an uncompromising level of hygiene: appliance rental companies! Appliance rental companies provide customers with their own washer/dryer set for personal home use without any risk of cross contamination from other users in a public setting like a coin-op laundry room or store front business facility . This is ideal for those who don’t feel comfortable using shared facilities during this time period without risking their health or safety due the potential spread virus particles from contact with contaminated surfaces such as door handles and machine control panels found within many common washing facilities used today . 

Plus , you can save money compared to regularly visiting a professional dry cleaner every few weeks! To learn more about finding an appliance rental company near you [check out our directory here](./pages/appliance-rental).
