## E21 Error Code Troubleshooting for Your Electrolux Washer
When you experience a problem with your home appliance, it can be stressful trying to figure out the exact issue and the best solution. Hopefully, this blog can help guide you toward finding the problem and successfully troubleshooting the e21 error code in your Electrolux washer. Here are the steps you can take to get your washer working properly again. 

The first step to take is to properly identify the e21 error code. To do this, check your user manual, which should indicate what the code means in relation to your particular washer. Furthermore, if there is a number associated with the code, such as e21 0, be sure to note that as well. Each number may represent a different error and require a different course of action. 

Once you understand the code, itâ€™s time to dive into the troubleshooting process. Here are some possible solutions you can take to get your washer running smoothly again:

* Run the washing machine on the empty cycle to ensure that the cycle is not blocked by a piece of clothing. 
* Check for any loose wires or components near your washer or in the control panel of the washer. 
* The e21 code can also be caused by having an excessive amount of detergent in the washer. If this could be the issue, be sure to remove any excess detergent. 

If these solutions do not work, it may be time to call a professional repair service. With a local professional, you can rest assured that the job will be done correctly and have your washer up and running again in no time.
