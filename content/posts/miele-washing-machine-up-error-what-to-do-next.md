## Handling a Miele Washing Machine Up Error

No one wants appliances to breakdown, especially if it's an expensive washer like a Miele. If your Miele's control panel is displaying an "Up Error," it means something has gone wrong - don't worry, we can help you troubleshoot the problem.

The first thing you should do is identify the error code. Error codes are letters and numbers that let the user and the repair person know what component is malfunctioning. Refer to your Miele washing machine manual or the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for more information.

Next, you should diagnose the issue. Try to determine what component or system is not functioning properly. This can be done by checking the control panel for blinking error lights or checking behind the washer for clogged connections. If you don't find any issues, then you should try a reset. Unplug the unit and leave it unplugged for 5 minutes, then plug it back in.

If the error persists, then it's possible the problem is beyond your knowledge. We recommend contacting Miele's Customer Support line at 1-800-999-1360. A professional appliance repair person can also diagnose and repair the problem for you.

In the event of a Miele washing machine Up Error, it's important to stay calm and proceed with caution. Identify the error code, diagnose the issue, and consider a reset before calling a professional to inspect it.
