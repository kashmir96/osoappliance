Are you confused by all the symbols on your oven? You’re not alone! Oven symbols can be confusing and intimidating, but they don’t have to be. This blog post is going to explain all the common symbols found on ovens in New Zealand, so you can get cooking with confidence. 

The first symbol you might come across is the fan symbol. This indicates that your oven has a fan-forced setting, which circulates hot air around the cavity of your oven for even cooking and faster preheating times. 

The second symbol is usually an ‘L’ or ‘C’ shaped line. This symbol indicates that there is a separate grill element in your oven. The ‘L’ shape shows that this element runs along both sides of the oven, while the ‘C’ shape shows that it runs around just one side of the cavity. 

You may also see a circular shape with arrows pointing outwards from it. This indicates that your oven has a convection setting, which allows you to cook food evenly and quickly by circulating heated air around the cavity of your oven at high speed. 

Another common symbol on New Zealand ovens is an image of a pizza or cake inside an oval-shaped box with two lines at either end. This indicates that there is a specific pizza/cake baking setting on your appliance, which ensures optimal results when baking these types of dishes. 

Finally, some models have a symbol featuring three horizontal lines with two curved lines above them (sometimes referred to as a 'shepherd's crook'). This indicates that there is an Eco mode available on your appliance – typically this will reduce energy consumption when using lower temperatures for extended periods of time (such as when slow cooking). 


Now that you know what all those symbols mean, it should be much easier to use and understand all the features available on your New Zealand oven!
