## Finding the Best Air Conditioners in New Zealand

Choosing the right air conditioner to meet your needs can be a challenge! New Zealand's climate requires specialized air conditioning that can keep you and your family cool and comfortable in sticky Summer temperatures. This guide will help make the process as stress-free as possible. 

When selecting an air conditioner, the two main factors to consider are size and type. It's important to select an air conditioner that is the right size for the area you want to cool. Too small an air conditioner and it won't cool the room sufficiently; too big and it won't be able to cycle on and off correctly, resulting in higher energy bills. 

Split cycle ducted systems are popular for whole-home cooling and heating, but for smaller spaces window units, split systems and portable air conditioners are also a great choice. Window units are the most affordable option for single room cooling, though you should keep in mind that some models such as window-mounted air conditioners require cutting a hole in the wall. 

It’s also essential to take into account the noise level of your air conditioner, especially if you’re looking to use it overnight or in the bedrooms. You can get the noise specs on all air conditioners and should consider the quieter models available. 

Other features to look out for include energy efficiency. Check the Energy Rating which will give you an indication of the energy efficiency of a particular model of air conditioner. 

By taking note of the factors mentioned above and doing some research, you should be able to find the best air conditioner to meet your needs. To help you get started, please check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview), where you can compare different makes and models. 

With the right research, you’ll have your new air conditioner installed and keeping you cool sooner than you could imagine.
