## 4 Steps for Kitchen Safety
Keeping your kitchen safe is essential for both your cooking success and your personal safety. Without proper safety guidelines in place, you could be dealing with scorched fingers, slips, and spills that can quickly put a damper on your cooking fun. Here's how to ensure your kitchen is safe with these four simple steps.

### Step 1: Clear the Counter
Nothing is more hazardous than having a cluttered countertop. Clear the area of any appliances, cookware, and cooking utensils that are not in use right away. You will want to be sure that you are able to move around easily and have easy access to your equipment as you cook.

### Step 2: Utilize Proper Equipment
Using sharp knives, pots, and pans that aren't appropriate for the dish can lead to disasters in the kitchen. Invest in quality kitchen tools and make sure that any equipment you are using is in good condition. If you're in doubt about an item, opt for one with a stainless steel or tempered glass construction.

### Step 3: Be Mindful of the Heat
Almost all kitchen disasters involve working with heat. Be sure to never leave a hot pan unattended and never reach across the burner. If you are using a deep fryer, make sure that the oil you are using is at the proper temperature and never add water to a hot pan.

### Step 4: Utilize Appliances
The right appliances can make all the difference when it comes to kitchen safety. Look for appliances specifically designed to prevent fires and other accidents, such as electric skillets with "cool-touch" handles or deep fryers with temperature controls.

Following these four simple steps will help ensure you are able to stay safe while you cook. To ensure safe cooking, consider investing in top-notch appliances that have been designed with safety in mind.
