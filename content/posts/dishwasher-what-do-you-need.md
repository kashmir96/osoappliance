If you’re in the market for a new dishwasher, you’ll want to make sure you know all the basics before you make your purchase. Dishwashers come in a variety of styles, sizes, and features, so it’s important to do your research to find the best model for your needs. Here’s what you need to know before buying a dishwasher.

Size

The first thing to consider is the size of your dishwasher. Dishwashers come in a range of sizes from 18” to 24” and larger. Measure the space where you plan to install the dishwasher to make sure you get the right size.

Features

Dishwashers come with a variety of features, from adjustable racks to adjustable spray arms and more. Consider the features you need, such as adjustable racks for larger dishes or adjustable spray arms for better cleaning results.

Noise Level

Dishwashers come with different noise levels, which can range from quiet to very loud. Consider the noise level of the dishwasher when making your purchase to make sure it won’t be too loud for your home.

Energy Efficiency

Look for dishwashers with an Energy Star rating. This indicates that the dishwasher meets certain energy efficiency standards, which can help you save money on your energy bills.

Installation

Make sure you know whether or not you’ll need to hire a professional to install your dishwasher. Some models are designed for easy DIY installation, while others require professional installation.

Price

Finally, consider your budget when shopping for a dishwasher. Dishwashers range in price from budget-friendly models to high-end models with all the bells and whistles.

By doing your research and considering all of these factors, you’ll be able to find the perfect dishwasher for your home.
