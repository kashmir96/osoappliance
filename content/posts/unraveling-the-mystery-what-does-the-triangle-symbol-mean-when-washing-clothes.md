## Triangles on Clothes Labels Represent Delicate Cycles
When doing laundry, deciphering clothing labels and symbols can be tricky. After all, the small triangular shapes are quite mysterious. This convenient guide explains precisely which settings the triangle symbol stands for. 

Many clothing labels feature the triangle symbol to describe the settings for washing delicate materials. This symbol indicates that the laundry should be done on a gentle or delicate cycle. The delicate cycle has a gentler washer motion and shorter washing time compared to other robust cycles, allowing fabrics to remain intact through the rigorous cleaning process. It is especially important to use the delicate cycle for clothing items that are made from gossamer fabrics like silk, acetate, and microfiber.

Unexpectedly, the triangle may also be used to caution against washing certain materials altogether. For these items, the blank triangle on the tag signifies that the garment should not be washed but instead taken to the dry cleaners. Of course, the article may also be hand washed if the instructions are available—not all items are labeled this way; however, even when the instructions are provided, it’s preferable to err on the safe side and send the fabrics to be professionally cleaned. 

Finally, there are particular materials that may not be machine washed at all. These materials are identified by cross-hatched triangles, or “X’s”. This symbol means that the material should not be cleaned in any way, as it could cause damage. Cleaning items with this sign could damage the items or even void the warranty on the clothing. 

In summary, the triangle is a versatile symbol when labeling clothing. Most commonly, it is used to indicate that the item should be washed delicately on a special cycle. In rare cases, it may also signal a restriction against machine- or hand-washing. Finally, the cross-hatched triangular symbol says that any type of cleaning should be avoided. To ensure that garments remain in the best possible condition, examine clothing labels carefully before throwing the items in the washing machine.
