# Circumstances for getting appliances test and tagged

Appliance testing and tagging is an essential part of electrical safety in the workplace and at home. It helps to ensure that all electrical equipment is operating safely and compliant with the relevant electrical standards.

The circumstances of when appliances need to be tested and tagged vary according to industry, workplace and type of equipment.

In New Zealand, workplace health and safety regulations require that all portable electrical equipment must be tested and tagged at regular intervals. This includes items such as portable power tools, extension leads, data cables, washing machines, dishwashers, heaters and other portable appliances.

In high-risk industries such as construction and mining, testing and tagging must be done more often. Depending on the industry, testing and tagging may need to be done at more frequent intervals, such as weekly or even daily.

In addition to regular testing and tagging, any electrical equipment that has been damaged, modified or repaired must also be tested and tagged before being put back into use. This is to ensure that any repairs, modifications or damage have not compromised the equipment's safety.

Testing and tagging is also important in the home, as it helps to ensure that all electrical items are safe to use. This includes appliances such as microwaves, toasters, kettles and dishwashers. Testing and tagging should be done at least once a year, or whenever the appliance is damaged, modified or repaired.

Ultimately, testing and tagging is an important part of electrical safety, and all electrical equipment should be tested and tagged at regular intervals. This helps to ensure that all electrical items are working safely and compliant with relevant electrical standards.
