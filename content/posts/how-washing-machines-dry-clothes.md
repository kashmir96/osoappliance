Washing machines are a modern convenience that many of us take for granted. But how do they actually dry our clothes? 

The first step in the drying process is to spin the clothes in the washing machine. This spins off excess water, reducing the amount of time it takes for them to dry. The spinning action also helps separate the fibers of the fabric, allowing air to move more freely around them.

This can extract up to 70% of the moisture from the clothes, but it is not enough to completely dry them. To finish the job, a dryer must be used.

Clothes dryers use heated air to evaporate the remaining moisture from the clothes. The air is drawn into the dryer and heated by an electric element or gas burner. As it passes through the drum, it absorbs moisture from the clothes and exits out of an exhaust vent. 

The heat also helps break down wrinkles in fabrics and can even help kill some bacteria and dust mites. 

The amount of time it takes for clothes to dry depends on a number of factors, such as the type of fabric, how wet they are, and how hot the air is. Generally speaking, it takes about 30 minutes to completely dry a load of laundry in a standard-sized dryer. 

Most modern washing machines come with a built-in drying cycle that automatically sets the correct temperature and time for drying your laundry. This makes it easier than ever to get perfectly dried clothing every time!
