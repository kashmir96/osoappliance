If your refrigerator is not making ice, it can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps that you can take to troubleshoot the issue and get your fridge back up and running in no time. 

1) Check the Ice Maker: The first thing to do is check if the ice maker itself is functioning properly. Look to see if the “on/off” switch on the side of the ice maker is in the “on” position and that it has power. If not, flip it to “on” and make sure it has power. If this does not solve your problem, proceed to step two below. 

2) Check for Obstructions: Sometimes an obstruction can prevent water from flowing into your ice maker tray. Check for clogs or blockage in water lines as well as frozen lines due to cold temperatures outside and inside of your home. Clear any obstructions from these areas and then check if water flows into your ice maker tray when you open its door or attempt to dispense cubed or crushed ice via its dispenser panel. 

3) Check Water Inlet Valve: The third step requires checking of the water inlet valve located inside your refrigerator’s freezer section; This device controls how much water flows into the unit's internal reservoir before being released into an ice cube tray that sits beneath it). To test whether or not this part is working properly, turn off its supply line (located near where you access it), remove its cover plate, then release a small amount of pressure by unplugging any hoses attached thereto until a steady stream of water appears coming out from within (or nearby). If there isn't any flow at all here, replace the valve with a new one before cycling power back on so that a steady stream may appear at this location once again. 

4) Clean Water Line Filters: Lastly, try cleaning any filters located along various parts within your fridge's water line system — such as those found at both points where outlet hoses attach onto valves in order allow for proper flow between them both — which will help ensure nothing gets stuck inside them blocking said flow over time; This should take care of most issues related to filtering (which could be preventing proper operation overall). 

5) Get in touch with a repairman or technician: If none of the above steps have solved your problem, it may be time to get in touch with a repairman or technician to take a look at your refrigerator and diagnose the issue. They will be able to identify any underlying issues and provide you with the necessary repairs to get your fridge back up and running. 

Following these steps should help solve any issue you may have with your refrigerator not making ice properly!
