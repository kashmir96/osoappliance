## HS Code for Electrical Hair Dryer

It can be difficult to find the correct HS Code for electrical appliances, especially for products that may seem as simple as a hair dryer. Fortunately, the Harmonized System (HS or HTS) is a comprehensive catalog of HS codes used to categorize goods for international trade, so look no further. The HS code for electrical hair dryers is 85166020.

Once you have the correct HS code, you can begin to look into the import/export rules and regulations that may be associated with the product. Depending on where the product is originating from, there may be additional documentation or steps that need to be taken. If you're not familiar with customs terms or the HS Codes, it’s best to consult a qualified professional to ensure compliance with customs regulations.

At the consumer level, having the right HS Code for a product will help you understand more about the product itself. Bigger electrical appliances like hair dryers have safety guidelines and specifications listed in the HS Code. This information is especially important because the safety of electrical products is paramount.

Before selecting any appliance for use in the home, such as a hair dryer, it's always best practice to check the HS Codes for additional product information. Without it, you may not be certain about the product you're using and whether it’s suitable for the intended purpose.
