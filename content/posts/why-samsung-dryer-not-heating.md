When your Samsung dryer is not heating, it can be incredibly frustrating. Not only is it inconvenient, but it can also mean that you are left with wet clothes that need to dry. Fortunately, there are a few common causes for this issue that you can troubleshoot. 

The most common cause of a Samsung dryer not heating is a faulty heating element. The heating element provides the heat needed to dry clothes and if it is damaged or has stopped working, the dryer will not heat. To check if this is the problem, remove the back panel of the dryer and inspect the heating element for signs of damage such as cracks or breaks. If the heating element looks intact, use a multimeter to test its continuity. If there is no continuity, then you will need to replace the heating element. 

Another potential cause of a Samsung dryer not heating is clogged vents or ducts. The vents and ducts allow air to flow freely through the dryer so that clothes can be dried efficiently. If these vents or ducts become clogged with lint or other debris, then air cannot move freely and the drying process will be slowed down or stopped altogether. To check if this is an issue, remove any lint buildup in the vents and ducts using a vacuum cleaner or compressed air. 

Finally, if your Samsung dryer still isn’t heating after checking both the heating element and vents/ducts, then you may have an issue with the thermostat. The thermostat controls how hot the dryer gets and if it isn’t functioning properly then your dryer won’t heat up properly either. To check if this is an issue, use a multimeter to test for continuity in the thermostat wires and replace any faulty components as needed. 

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose why your Samsung dryer isn’t heating up properly and take appropriate action to fix it!
