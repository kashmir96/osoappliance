## Troubleshoot the Bosch Dishwasher Error Code E61-02
It is never convenient when a household appliance breaks down. However, some errors can be resolved with troubleshooting and often do not require professional assistance with repairs. An E61-02 error code in Bosch dishwashers can generally be resolved with two simple troubleshooting steps.

The first step when troubleshooting the E61-02 error code is to examine the aqua sensor for any signs of damage or excessive buildup of limescale. The aqua sensor is a small probe located inside the dishwasher, near the bottom. This probe senses the conductivity of the water in the dishwasher and sends a signal to the dishwasher's main control board. If the signal is not strong enough, or if the probe is clogged or damaged, the control panel will trigger a fault code and turn the dishwasher off.

The second step is to clean any residual lime or scale from the dishwasher, starting from the sump area, which is just below the filter. This can be done with a household cleaner that is safe to use with dishwashers. It is usually recommended to run the dishwasher an additional cycle after cleaning the sump to make sure that the dishwasher is free of any residue or scale.

If the steps above do not solve the E61-02 error code, then it may be best to contact a professional technician who is experienced with Bosch dishwashers to conduct more thorough repairs. Knowing the error codes of your appliances is a great way to keep them running smoothly and help avoid costly repairs.
