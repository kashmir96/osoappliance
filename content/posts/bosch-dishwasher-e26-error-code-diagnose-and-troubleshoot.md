## Diagnosing and Troubleshooting Bosch Dishwasher E26 Error Code

The E26 error code on a Bosch dishwasher is one of the most common dishwasher error codes that there is. Knowing how to troubleshoot and diagnose an E26 error code will help you determine if you need to call a professional appliance repair technician to fix the dishwasher. 

The first step in diagnosing the Bosch dishwasher E26 error code is to determine what the code means. This error code means that there is a problem with the heating element located on the bottom of the dishwasher. If the heating element is not functioning properly, then the dishwasher will not be able to clean the dishes properly.

The next step is to troubleshoot the problem with the heating element. First, check to make sure that the power is on. Sometimes, the power will be turned off or the circuit breaker will have tripped and the dishwasher will not be able to run. If the power is on, then check to make sure that the heating element is connected properly. If the heating element is not connected properly, then it wil not be able to supply the necessary heat to the dishwasher.
