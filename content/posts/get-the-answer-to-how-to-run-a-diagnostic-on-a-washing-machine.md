## Learn to Easily Run a Diagnostic on Your Washing Machine

When your washing machine isn't functioning as it should, it is often necessary to perform a diagnostic in order to identify the potential cause of the problem. Even if you're not a household appliance expert, running a diagnostic on a washing machine is actually quite simple. Here's how to do it. 

The first step is to locate the diagnostic service mode. This should be in the form of a control panel solid state display. On some models this is a two digit code and on others it is an LED panel with a 'Diagnosis' or 'Diagnostics' button. This can be found on the back or side of the washer. 

Once the diagnostic service mode is found, press and hold the start button for 5 seconds until you hear a beep. On some machines, this also turns machines off, so you may have to turn your machine back on to proceed. 

Now activate the diagnostic service mode. This should show a number of diagnostic codes. As the codes vary from model to model, it’s important to refer to the user manual of your washing machine and locate the exact diagnostic service code your machine will display. Once you've identified the correct code, you can press the relevant button to run the diagnosis. 

If the diagnosis comes back positive, it’s a good idea to run a second and third round of diagnostics to ensure accuracy. Different issues with your machine can present with similar symptoms, so it’s important not to take one result in isolation.

Finally, once the diagnostic is complete, record the codes and look up their meanings for the best advice on how to deal with the issue. If your repair skills are limited and you’re unable to fix the machine yourself, it’s best to contact a qualified expert and have them take a look. 

Running a diagnostic on a washing machine can seem daunting but following the five steps outlined above, it's a much simpler process than initially thought. If, after running a diagnostic, you need help getting your machine fixed then take a look at our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) for the best options.
