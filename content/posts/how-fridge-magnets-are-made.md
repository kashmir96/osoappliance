When you think of magnets, one of the first things that come to mind is fridge magnets. These decorative and useful little items have been found in homes all around the world for decades. But have you ever wondered how they are made? Let’s take a look at the process behind these iconic items. 

The first step in making a fridge magnet is to create a mold or cast of the design that will be used on the magnet itself. This is typically done with plastic or metal molds that are filled with liquid resin and cured until it forms a solidified shape. Once this has been completed, any detail work can be added to give it its final look before being placed into an oven for further curing. 

After curing, most manufacturers will add some sort of magnetic material to the back side of their fridge magnets. This can either come in the form of small thin strips or larger chunks depending on their desired strength and weight requirements for each particular product line-up. The magnetic material is typically glued onto the backside using an adhesive substance like epoxy glue before being left to cure once again in an oven or other heat source. 

Now comes time for painting! Depending on what type of finish needs to be applied, different methods may be used including airbrushing and hand-painted details with brush strokes that adhere directly onto the surface after drying completely. After all decorations have been applied, your fridge magnet will then go through additional quality control checks such as weight tests and pull strength measurements before being shipped out by its manufacturer! 

In conclusion, making fridge magnets requires a few steps but they’re all worth it when you have such beautiful pieces adorning your refrigerator door! From molding your desired shape to adding intricate details by hand painting them one at a time - each individual product created contributes to its final charm once it reaches homes all over!
