## Fixing the 'Be' Error Code on Your LG Dishwasher 
Keeping your dishwasher running smoothly requires some diligence, and sometimes you may experience a problem with your dishwasher that requires troubleshooting. One common issue is the 'Be' error code on an LG dishwasher, which signals an issue with the water pressure level.

The first thing to do is to make sure that the inlet water valve is fully open to the maximum setting. The inlet valve is the mechanism that controls the dishwasher's access to water from the house supply. If the pressure is too low or blocked then the dishwasher won't receive enough water to operate correctly and this will cause the 'Be' error code. 

Once checked you should then remove the bottom pan from the dishwasher by releasing the retaining screws then tilt it out of the bottom of the dishwasher. Inspect the pan for any debris that may have accumulated in the sump in the bottom of the dishwasher, any such debris can lead to incorrect water pressures and even block the water from entering the sump.

If the pan and hoses appear to be clear then you should inspect the water inlet valve at the back of the dishwasher, which is the device connected to the hoses leading to the inlet which supplies the dishwasher with water. An electrical continuity test should be performed on the valve with a multi-meter and if the valve is faulty then it should be replaced.

Finally, if all else fails then you can check the water pressure entering the dishwasher. This can be done by running the sink nearest to the dishwasher and then check the pressure with a pressure gauge. The optimal pressure is typically between 20-100PSI and the minimum pressure should always be over 15PSI.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the 'Be' error code on your LG dishwasher, but if you require any further assistance then our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) is a great resource for further diagnosis.
