If your dryer is making an odd noise, it could be a sign that something is wrong. One of the most common noises is a squeaking sound, which usually indicates an issue with the motor or belt. Fortunately, there are some things you can try before calling an appliance repair technician from our directory to get your dryer fixed.

The most common cause of a squeaky dryer is worn out drum rollers and glides. These parts help support the drum as it rotates and reduce friction during operation. Overtime, these components can start to wear down leading to excess friction and resulting in a squeak during each rotation cycle. Inspecting these parts for damage or excessive wear can help determine if this is the source of the noise and whether they need replacing or not.

Another possible cause of loud noises coming from your dryer could be loose screws or bolts on the outside paneling. This often happens as metal components expand and contract with temperature changes so check all bolts around your machine for any looseness and tighten them up using a screwdriver if necessary. 

In addition, make sure you check for any obstructions in the lint filter or vent hose as these can also create excess noise by blocking airflow inside your machine. A blocked filter will reduce drying efficiency but may not be obvious until checked manually so make sure this gets looked at too! 
 
Finally, inspect all moving parts such as belts and pulleys for signs of wear & tear - if necessary replace them with new ones from our directory! Any worn-out component should be replaced ASAP to avoid further problems down the line (and potential safety hazards).
