## Uncover What Washing Machine Symbols Mean to Take the Mystery Out of Doing Laundry
Looking at symbols and feeling mystified by them while doing laundry is a common problem, but deciphering the purpose of each symbol can make laundry day a lot easier. Each symbol has a specific meaning, so it’s possible to know the right washing machine settings for new and different types of laundry.

When doing laundry, the appropriate settings can make a big difference in the result. It’s no wonder that many users find themselves confused about what the symbols on the washing machine mean and how those symbols should be interpreted. Fortunately, it’s not difficult to make sense of them.

The symbols on today’s washers come from an international standard that makes it easy to recognize and understand them no matter the language or culture. The star system, which ranges from one to five stars, tells users how much energy the washer uses and allows them to select the wash cycle specifically for the fabrics or items in the load. A higher number of stars means a more efficient cycle.

The temperature setting symbol represents the water temperature the cycle should use, while other symbols represent washing time, spin speed, and soil level settings. Knowing and understanding these symbols, which are very similar no matter the brand of washer, can help users select the most suitable cycle to clean their laundry.

In general, the simpler the washing cycle is, the better. Using the right water temperature, soil level, and spin speed for different items will ensure clean and safe laundry results. It’s important to remember that different fabrics have different needs and shouldn’t be washed together.

If there's ever any confusion or questions about how to use a specific washing machine and its symbols, a helpful resource to find out more information is the Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary. 

Including the relevant symbols next to the instruction manual makes using a washing machine a much easier process. By exploring the symbols, users can decipher the purpose for each setting and make educated decisions about which cycle to choose for their laundry loads. Doing so can help save energy and keep garments looking and lasting better for longer periods.
