## Dealing With a Noisy Washing Machine

The last thing you want on laundry day is a noisy washing machine spinning out of control. Squealing and grinding noises, water leaking, and vibrating can all be signs of a malfunctioning washing machine. If you're struggling with a noisy washer, here's what you should do.

The first step is to inspect the washing machine to identify any visible problems. If you notice signs of water leakage, examine the hoses and any internal seals to check for wear and tear. Banging noises may be due to unbalanced loading or hooks and brackets that may be loose or damaged. If it's a grinding or squealing sound, this could be the motor bearings.

To fix the issues, deactivate the power to the appliance and then address the root cause of the problem. If you detect water issues, shut off the water supply and consider replacing the hoses if they appear worn or cracked. With unbalanced load, redistribute clothing evenly and retighten hooked and brackets if needed. If it's a problem with the motor bearings, replace the bearing with a new one.

Dealing with a noisy washing machine doesn't have to be a job you tackle alone. If you find yourself struggling with repairs, reach out to a qualified professional.

Find the right repair technician and get your washing machine running quietly in no time.
