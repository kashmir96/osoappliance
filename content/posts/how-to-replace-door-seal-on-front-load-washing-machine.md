# How to replace door seal on front load washing machine

If you have a front-load washing machine, it’s important that you know how to properly replace its door seal. The door seal is one of the most important parts of a washing machine, as it helps keep water in and dirt and debris out. Over time, the seal can become worn and need to be replaced. Fortunately, replacing a door seal is a relatively simple task that anyone with basic DIY skills can do.

Before you begin, make sure you have all of the necessary tools and materials on hand. You’ll need a screwdriver, a utility knife, and a new door seal. You can purchase a door seal from a local appliance store or online.

Once you have everything you need, the first step is to unplug the washing machine from the wall and disconnect the water supply. Then, remove the screws located around the door of the washing machine. Be sure to keep track of which screw came from where.

Next, you’ll need to remove the old door seal. To do this, use a utility knife to carefully pry off the old seal by using your tool to get under the wire holding it over the external lip. Then, unscrew the top panel from the back of the machine, pop the lid off, then unscrew the control panel (you don't need to touch any of the wires). 

With the lid and control panel off you can access the screws for the front panel, unscrew the front panel at all four corners of the machine. Lift the front panel off and use your tool to pry off the second spring holding the inside of the door seal onto the drum casing. You now should have the old door seal in your hands free from the machine. 

Be sure to take your time and be extra careful when removing the seal, as you don’t want to damage any other parts of the washing machine.

Once you have removed the old seal, you can install the new one. Take your time and make sure that the seal is properly positioned and secure. Using some dish soap along the inside of the seal can help get it over the lip of the drum casing easier. Repeat the steps you used to remove the old seal in reverse to reassemble the machine. 

Finally, plug the washing machine back in and turn it on to make sure that the seal is properly installed. If everything looks good and you have no leaks, you’re done!

Replacing the door seal on a front-load washing machine is a simple and straightforward task. By following the steps outlined above, you’ll be able to get your machine back up and running in no time.
