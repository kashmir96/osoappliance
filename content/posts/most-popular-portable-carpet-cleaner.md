When it comes to cleaning carpets, the most popular portable carpet cleaner is undoubtedly the Bissell SpotClean ProHeat Portable Carpet Cleaner. This small, lightweight machine is perfect for spot-cleaning carpets, rugs, and upholstery in your home or office. It uses powerful suction and heat to break up tough stains and remove them from your carpet fibers. Plus, the two tank system keeps clean water separate from dirty water, so you always know exactly what’s being used on your carpets.

The SpotClean ProHeat has a number of features that make it stand out from other portable carpet cleaners on the market. For example, its adjustable hose makes it easy to reach hard-to-clean areas like stairs or furniture legs. Plus, you can customize the power of the suction with multiple settings depending on how much dirt needs to be removed from your carpets. The machine also has a built-in heater that helps loosen ground-in dirt and debris without damaging delicate fabrics like silk or wool.

In addition to its powerful cleaning capabilities, one of the best things about this machine is its easy portability. Its long cord allows you to move freely around rooms without having to unplug and plug in again as you go along. And at just 13 lbs., this cleaner is lightweight enough for anyone in your family to use it with ease! Plus, when you’re done cleaning a room or area simply empty out both tanks into a sink or toilet before storing away in its convenient carrying case that comes with each purchase of this product!
