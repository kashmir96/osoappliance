First and foremost, consider the type of hair dryer that will best suit your needs. Do you have very fine hair which requires a gentler heat setting? Or do you plan on using your dryer frequently and need something powerful enough to handle frequent use? 

Next, consider features such as multiple heat settings, diffusers and cool-shot buttons. These features can be extremely helpful if you want to create different hairstyles with your dryer or simply want more precision when styling your tresses. Some models also offer additional add-on attachments such as concentrators or smoothing brushes that can help further enhance your styling experience.

As with any product, higher wattage generally means better performance but it also comes at at higher cost. If budget is an issue for you then look out for special offers or discounts from various retailers in order to get the best value for money. 

No matter what type of hair dryer you choose in Christchurch, make sure it meets all the requirements above so that you get the best possible results from your purchase!
