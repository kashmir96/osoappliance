## Understanding Washing Machine Error Codes - F5 and E2
Getting started with a washing machine is a daunting task for many of us who don't go beyond the start button. However, in order to best ensure the safe and optimal functioning of a washer, it's important to pay attention to errors codes like F5 and E2.

F5 and E2 are two common error codes that can pop up when something isn't working as it should with your washing machine. F5 relates to the water temperature, while E2 is associated with the water level. 

F5 usually indicates a water temperature issue that needs to be addressed before further use of the washer. Specifically, there may be a problem with the water temp sensor and one solution is to check this part to make sure that electricity is reaching it. If it is not getting electricity, attempt to reset it by unplugging the unit for a few seconds and plugging it back in. If this doesn't work, then it’s likely time to replace the part. 

E2, on the other hand, usually indicates a water level issue with the washer. Many newer models feature autowashing settings that detect how much water is needed for a successful wash cycle. These settings can malfunction causing the E2 error to appear. To fix this, reset the washer by unplugging it for a few seconds and then plugging it back in. It's also a good idea to do a quick check of the water inlet valve to ensure it's functioning properly.

Errors like F5 and E2 on a washing machine can be intimidating, but the cause and solutions are usually quite simple. If further troubleshooting is necessary, it’s best to consult our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for guidance on what the error code means and what steps to take.
