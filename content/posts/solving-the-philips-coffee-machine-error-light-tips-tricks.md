## Tips & Tricks to Troubleshoot Philips Coffee Machine Error Lights 

Maintaining the perfect cup of coffee requires one essential ingredient: a functioning Philips coffee machine. All types of Philips machines—from single serve brewers to bean-to-cup models—are designed to make the perfect cup of coffee. But when an error light flashes, the ability to make that perfect cup of coffee may be in question. 

Fortunately, many in-home Philips coffee machine error lights can be corrected with a few troubleshooting tips. In most instances, the handle is not inserted correctly, the water tank is empty, the filter needs to be changed, or the machine needs to be descaled. To address each of these potential causes and ensure a functioning Philips machine, follow these easy steps:

- Check the handle: First, ensure that the handle is in the correct position. Closely inspect the handle to ensure it is completely inserted and inserted in the correct direction. Gently push and pull the handle to ensure it is properly seated. 

- Check the water tank: Second, check the water tank. Look to see if it is empty and needs to be refilled. Then remove the tank, empty and refill as necessary, and then reinsert the tank. 

- Check the filter: Next, check the filter. Determine if it needs to be changed and replace if necessary. To change the filter, remove the entire filter holder, throw away the old filter, insert the new filter, clean the filter holder, and then reinsert the filter holder. 

- Descale the machine: Finally, the last step is to descale the machine. Descaling is a process that removes the mineral buildup from the inner workings of the coffee machine. Descaling will prolong the life of the machine and ensure a consistent cup of coffee. 

With the help of these easy tips and tricks, anyone can easily troubleshoot their Philips coffee machine error lights.
