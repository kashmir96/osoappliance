Have you ever wondered how a fridge works? A refrigerator is a machine that keeps food and other perishable items cold by removing heat from the air inside it. It has several different components that work together to maintain the desired temperature.

The main component of a refrigerator is an evaporator coil, which works to cool the air inside the fridge. This coil is filled with refrigerant, such as Freon, which absorbs heat from the air when it evaporates. The cooled air then circulates through the fridge and cools down whatever food or other items are stored inside it.

In order for this process to happen, there needs to be an outside source of energy to power the compressor motor. The compressor motor pumps refrigerant up through a set of condenser coils that are located at the back or top of your fridge. These coils release heat into your kitchen via their fan while also cooling down the liquid refrigerant so it can once again pass over your evaporator coil and absorb more heat from the air in your fridge.

Once cooled, this liquid refrigerant will continue on its journey through a set of small copper tubes called capillary tubes before entering your freezer section at lower temperatures than those in your refrigerator's interior section(s). This helps keep all parts of your fridge at their proper temperature levels so you can enjoy fresh food for days! 

In addition to these main components, most fridges also have features like adjustable shelves and door seals that help keep cold air inside where it belongs while preventing warm air from entering and compromising efficiency levels further still. 
 
All in all, modern fridges are incredibly efficient machines that make storing food much easier than ever beforeâ€”all thanks to clever engineering and thoughtful design!
