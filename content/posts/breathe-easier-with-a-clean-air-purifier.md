## Enjoy Clean Air at Home With an Air Purifier

For many of us, air quality is of upmost importance — especially in the home. Keeping your home's air clean is important for your family's health, so you will want to invest in a good quality air purifier. Air purifiers remove airborne particles and pollutants of all sizes, providing cleaner, healthier air. But how do you know which air purifier is right for your needs? Here's an overview of air purifiers and what you should consider before purchasing.

There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market. Some use a disposable filter to trap air particles, while others use an electrostatic filter and ultraviolet light to kill germs, bacteria and viruses. The best type of air purifier for your home is the one that can filter particles of all sizes, from small dust particles to larger pollutants. Additionally, look for a unit with adjustable speeds that can keep up with your home’s changing air quality needs.

When purchasing an air purifier, pay attention to energy efficiency. Air cleaners with high energy efficiency ratings are often more cost effective in the long run. Additionally, air purifiers with specialized technologies, like HEPA filters and air cleaners with active carbon filters, may be able to remove more pollutants, allergens, and toxins from the air.

Finally, be sure to read customer reviews carefully to ensure you’re getting a quality product. Quality air purifiers are likely to last up to 5 years and come with a warranty, so be sure to research the warranty details before making a purchase.

## Frequently Asked Questions on Air Purifiers

Q. What is an air purifier? 
A. An air purifier is a device that draws in the air through the fan, then passes it through the filter which captures the airborne pollutants, irritants and allergens. The air is then recirculated back into the environment cleaner and fresher.

Q. What are the benefits of using an air purifier? 
A. An air purifier can help you breathe easier by reducing the allergens and pollutants that you breathe in. This can help relieve allergy and asthma symptoms, improve the quality of the air indoors, and reduce the risk of disease from particles in the air.

Q. How often do I need to change the filter in an air purifier? 
A. It is recommended that for maximum efficiency, filters should be changed every three to six months. This will depend on the type of filter and how much air the purifier is filtering. If a filter is dirty and needs to be changed sooner, the air purifier should be cleaned and the filter replaced.

A. The best type of air purifier will depend on your needs. For example, if you have allergies, you may want to look for a purifier with a HEPA filter that can filter out small particles.
