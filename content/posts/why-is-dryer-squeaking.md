Noisy dryers can be a nuisance, and a squeaking dryer is one of the most common causes of noise. A squeaking dryer can be caused by a number of different issues, ranging from worn out parts to improper installation. Here’s why your dryer might be squeaking and what you can do to fix it.

1. Worn Out Parts: One of the most common causes of a squeaking dryer is worn out parts. The drum bearings or motor bearings may be worn out and need to be replaced. To determine if this is the cause of your squeaking, take the back panel off your dryer and inspect the bearings for wear and tear. If you find any damage, it’s best to replace the bearings as soon as possible to prevent further damage.

2. Loose Drum: Another common cause of a squeaking dryer is a loose drum. This can occur if the drum isn’t properly secured with screws or bolts when it was installed. To determine if this is the cause of your noise, check to make sure all screws or bolts that secure the drum are tight and secure. If they aren’t, you may need to tighten them or replace them with new screws or bolts.

3. Improper Installation: If your dryer was not installed properly, it could also be causing a squeaking noise. An improperly installed dryer may not have been leveled correctly and could be causing vibration when running which leads to noise. To determine if this is the cause of your noise, check to make sure your dryer is level using a level tool such as a carpenter’s level or bubble level tool. If it isn’t level, you will need to re-level it before running your dryer again in order to prevent further damage or noise issues.

4. Clogged Lint Trap: A clogged lint trap can also cause a squeaking sound in some cases as well due to improper airflow through the lint trap area which can lead to vibration when running which leads to noise issues. To determine if this is the cause of your noise issue, take off the lint filter cover and inspect for clogs or blockages in the lint trap area that could be preventing proper airflow through that area and causing vibration when running leading to noise issues. If you find any blockages, remove them before running your dryer again in order to prevent further damage or noise issues from occurring due to improper airflow through that area of your lint filter cover area . 

If you have determined that one of these issues is causing your noisy dryer, there are steps you can take in order to fix it yourself such as replacing worn out parts, tightening loose screws/bolts on the drum, re-leveling an improperly installed machine or removing clogs from lint traps area . However if these steps don't fix your problem then it's time for professional help from an appliance repair technician who will have experience fixing noisy machines like yours .
