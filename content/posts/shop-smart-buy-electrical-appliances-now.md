## Save Money & Time with Right Appliance Purchases

The right electrical appliances can save both time and money. Whether it’s a refrigerator, washer/dryer, oven/range hood, or another appliance, shopping wisely means better savings in the long run. Not only will you save money on the purchase price, but also through lowering your electricity bill, increasing efficiency, and avoiding costly repair bills. Here are a few tips on how to make smart choices when buying electrical appliances. 

Water efficiency is an important factor when choosing energy efficient appliances. Look for water heaters with an ‘Energy Star’ rating, as these are the most efficient with lower running costs. Many new refrigerators come with built-in water filtration, which can save time for purchasers who live in areas where the water quality is a concern. 

When purchasing a washer and dryer make sure to look for features such as multiple temperature settings and load sensor technology. Washers with adjustable temperature settings are increasingly in demand, as they can save electricity and water during use. Dryers with load sensor technology optimize energy consumption and drying times, allowing customers to save on their energy bills and not have to wait for clothing items to dry.

You have to consider the size and space of your kitchen too when selecting ovens and range hoods. Ovens can come in various sizes and cooking capabilities that fit most cooks’ needs and their kitchen space. Range hoods are another appliance that can save time and money with their built-in sensors that can detect and filter air to eliminate smoke and contain the heat.

It’s also important to take into account the cost of the repair service. Good warranties should cover most repairs and regular maintenance checks, so make sure to read the details of any warranty that comes with your appliance purchase.
