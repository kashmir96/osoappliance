The best washing machine of 2023 promises to be a powerful and efficient machine that can handle all of your laundry needs. From traditional top loaders to high-tech front-loaders, today's washers are more capable than ever before. 

The modern washing machine has come a long way since the days of hand-washing and wringer washers. Today's models boast advanced technology, energy efficiency and cost savings. High-end models now offer features like automatic sorting, steam cycles, and Wi-Fi connectivity to give you control over your laundry from anywhere in the world. 

What should you look for in the best washing machines of 2023? To start with, look for units with an Energy Star rating from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rating indicates that a model is energy efficient, helping you save money on monthly utility bills. Additionally, consider choosing a unit with cycles optimized for different types of fabrics and soils such as permanent press or delicate cycle settings. 

If you live in an area where water is scarce or expensive, consider purchasing an ENERGY STAR certified water saving model that uses up to 25 percent less water during your wash cycle than standard models do. Some newer models are even equipped with sensors that detect how much soil is present before they use the correct amount of water required to get clothes looking their best again. Many also come with automatic detergent dispensers or premeasured pod compartments so you don’t have to guess at how much detergent is needed per load size. 

Other features worth looking out for include noise reduction technology which keeps laundry noise levels down while still delivering great results; anti-bacterial cycles which remove 99% of bacteria from fabrics; and allergy care settings which reduce allergens as well as dust mites during each wash cycle. You may also want to look at innovative solutions like mobile apps which allow you to remotely control your washer from any location using your smartphone or tablet device; voice command capability; NFC enabled smart tags for easy identification of items within each load; and steam function capabilities too! 

Overall, the best washing machines of 2023 will provide superior performance while keeping utility costs low thanks to their energy efficient design features and innovative technologies available on many higher end models . They will make doing laundry convenient again by offering features such as remote control access through mobile apps ; voice command activation ; smart tag identification ; plus improved cleaning power through steam functions , anti-bacterial cycles , allergy care settings , and more . With these cutting edge features , it’s no wonder why so many people are choosing these advanced machines over traditional top loaders !
