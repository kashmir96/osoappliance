## Understand the Risks Before Using Oven Cleaner 

When it comes to keeping your oven clean, oven cleaner is an effective but potentially dangerous product. Oven cleaners are usually alkaline based, which means they release caustic fumes and can cause severe chemical burns if mishandled or used without proper safety gear. To stay safe and use oven cleaner effectively, it’s important to be aware of all the associated dangers. 

### Fumes & Inhalation of Vapors 

Oven cleaners often contain caustic chemicals like sodium hydroxide, lye, and sodium carbonate. These chemicals release fumes that are corrosive and hazardous to your health. Inhaling these fumes can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, sore throat and eye irritation. Some oven cleaner products are labeled as “fume-free”, but you still need to keep the area well ventilated while you’re working. Keep your face away from the cleaner, and use gloves and safety glasses to protect your skin and eyes. 

### Skin Contact 

Contact with skin is also hazardous. Some oven cleaners contain grease-cutting agents like sodium hydrogen sulfate that are extremely corrosive to the skin. Always wear protective gloves and long-sleeved clothing to prevent skin contact with the cleaner. Some skin reactions can cause burns, blisters and permanent scarring. If you happen to come in direct contact with oven cleaner, rinse the affected area with cold water and seek medical help if skin irritation persists. 

### Eye Contact 

Eye contact with oven cleaner chemicals is especially dangerous. Corrosive chemicals can cause irreversible damage to the eye’s delicate tissue. Wear protective goggles and keep your face away from the cleaner while spraying. If any of the cleaner sprays into your eye, quickly flush your eye with plenty of lukewarm water and seek medical help as soon as possible. 

### Preparing & Washing 

It’s important to prepare the area before use. Make sure the oven is completely cool, and all oven racks and removable pieces are out. Cover any wiring, lights, and cords with plastic bags to prevent corrosive damage. To clean the oven, squirt or spray oven cleaner on all surfaces, being careful not to get any on yourself or come into contact with your skin. Let the cleaner sit for 10-15 minutes (varies by product) before wiping off with a damp cloth after the worst of the grime has broken down. 

To protect yourself, your oven, and get the best clean, it’s a good idea to carefully read the instructions before using oven cleaner and take all the necessary precautions. If you’re uncertain about using it, reach out to an [appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for assistance.
