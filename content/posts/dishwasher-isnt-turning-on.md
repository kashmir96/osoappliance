If your dishwasher isn’t turning on, it can be a real hassle. There are a few things you can try before calling a technician to come out and take a look.

First, check to make sure that the dishwasher is plugged in and that the outlet is working properly. If the dishwasher is plugged in and the outlet is working, then the next step is to check the circuit breaker. If the circuit breaker has tripped, then you’ll need to reset it.

If the circuit breaker is not the problem, then you’ll need to check the door switch. The door switch is a small switch located inside the dishwasher door. When the door is closed, the switch should be in the “closed” position. If the switch is not in the “closed” position, then the dishwasher won’t turn on.

If the door switch is not the problem, then it’s possible that the dishwasher’s motor is not working. You can test the motor by unplugging the dishwasher and then checking the wiring with a multimeter. If the wiring is not working properly, then the motor may need to be replaced.

Finally, if none of these solutions work, then it’s possible that the dishwasher’s control board is not working properly. The control board is responsible for controlling the dishwasher’s functions. If the control board is not working, then it will need to be replaced.

If you’ve tried all of these solutions and your dishwasher still isn’t turning on, then it’s time to call a technician. A technician will be able to diagnose the problem and make the necessary repairs.
