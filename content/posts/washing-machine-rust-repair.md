# Washing machine rust repair

When rust begins to form on a washing machine, it can be quite concerning. After all, a rusty washer doesn't just look bad, it can also cause your clothes to get stained and increase the probability of equipment failure. Fortunately, there are ways you can repair rust from your washing machine. 

The first step is to identify where the rust is originating from. Most washing machines have a tub made of stainless steel or another metal alloy. These tubs usually don't rust, but if water collects in the rim at the top and corrodes it over time, rust might form in that area. 

Once you've identified where the rust originated from, you'll need to prepare for repairs. Start by unplugging your washer and emptying its water line by disconnecting the hose from the wall pipe. Next, take off any removable parts such as hoses or lids so that you can access any rusty areas more easily. 

Now it's time to remove the rust! You'll want to start with some basic cleaning supplies such as dish soap and steel wool or abrasive cloths that won't damage your washer's surface while still removing tough corrosion. Apply some dish soap onto a rag or steel wool pad and scrub away at any rusty spots until most of the corrosion is gone – then rinse off with water when you're done and let dry before reassembling all parts again! 

After cleaning off any affected areas with soap and steel wool or cloths, apply a protective coating like Rust-Oleum Metal Primer & Paint or Rust-Oleum Stops Rust Spray Paint & Primer onto your washer's surfaces so that newly exposed metal won't become corroded again quickly over time! Make sure you follow all directions on product labels carefully before doing this step! This will help provide additional protection against future damage caused by moisture buildup in your washer over time -– saving both money (because repairs will be less frequent) as well as frustration when trying to keep clothes looking their best! 

Rust repair doesn’t have to be intimidating—just remember these steps! Unplugging your washer; removing any debris; scrubbing away at rusty spots with dish soap and steel wool/abrasive cloths; applying a protective coating like Rust-Oleum Metal Primer & Paint; then reassembling all parts once dry should successfully restore your washing machine back into working condition – allowing you enjoy clean laundry without worrying about future equipment failure due to corrosive buildup again anytime soon!
