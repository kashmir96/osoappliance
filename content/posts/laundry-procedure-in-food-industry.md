The laundry procedure in the food industry is an important part of keeping a safe and clean environment. Properly washing and sanitizing garments can help to prevent the spread of disease-causing bacteria. The following steps outline the process of proper laundry procedure in the food industry:

1. Sort Clothing: Before loading clothing into a washing machine, it is important to sort them by color or fabric type. Separate light colored items from dark colored items, as well as any non-washable items such as aprons or uniforms with special care instructions. This helps ensure that colors do not run and that delicate fabrics are not damaged during the wash cycle. 

2. Pre-treat Stains: For any stubborn stains on garments, pre-treating them with a stain remover prior to laundering can help remove more stubborn marks. Pre-treating should be done using a product specifically designed for this purpose rather than normal detergent for best results. 

3. Load Machine: Once all clothing has been sorted, it is time to load them into the washing machine according to manufacturer’s instructions for best results. Make sure that there are no clumps of clothing in any one area so that water can run freely throughout all areas of the load during each cycle for optimal cleaning power and minimal damage to fabrics over time from overloading or underloading . 

4. Detergent & Sanitizer Selection: It is important when laundering food industry garments that you choose products specifically designed for this purpose such as detergents with bleach alternative formulas and sanitizers labeled as “food contact safe” which have been proven effective against common microorganisms found in food processing environments such as E Coli or salmonella bacteria strains.. 

5 Rinse Cycle & Dryer Setting : After all clothes have been washed thoroughly , it is important to rinse them properly before drying . Hot water should be used on whites while cold water should be used on colors . Additionally , dryer settings should be adjusted accordingly based on garment type – low heat settings work best for delicate fabrics while high heat settings work better for heavy duty items like aprons . Finally , always make sure lint traps are cleaned out after each use ! 

6 Final Check : As an added precaution , inspect all clothes once they come out of the washer/dryer before putting away . Make sure there are no remaining stains or odors left behind from previous loads . If any issues arise , rewash if possible or discard if necessary ! 

 Following these steps will ensure proper laundry procedures are followed in order keep your workplace hygienic and safe!
