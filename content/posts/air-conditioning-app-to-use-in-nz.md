In New Zealand, air conditioning has become an increasingly popular way to keep homes and businesses cool during the hot summer months. With advancements in technology, there are now several air conditioners available that can be controlled remotely via an app. This makes it easier than ever to adjust the temperature from anywhere with your smartphone or other device.

The first type of air conditioner you can use with an app is a split system. This is a two-part unit that combines an indoor and outdoor unit. The indoor unit contains the evaporator, fan and compressor while the outdoor unit houses the condenser, compressor and expansion valve. By using an app, you can easily control both units from wherever you are to change settings like mode (cooling or heating), fan speed and temperature.

Another type of air conditioner that uses apps is a multi-split system. A multi-split system allows you to connect multiple indoor units to one outdoor condensing unit—allowing you to cool multiple rooms at once while conserving energy by only running one outdoor condenser unit at a time. Like with a split system, you can control all of these units using your smartphone or other device through an app so you don’t have to manually adjust each individual component when making changes.

Finally, if you’re looking for something more permanent than portable air conditioning units but don’t want something as large as a split or multi-split system, then ductless mini splits might be just what you need! These systems combine one small outdoor condensing unit with multiple small indoor fan coils—allowing for precision cooling in individual rooms without having bulky ducts cluttering up your space. With these types of systems as well, many models come equipped with apps so that you can control them remotely from anywhere with your smartphone or other device for maximum convenience. 

No matter what kind of air conditioning solution best fits your needs in New Zealand, there are plenty of options out there which offer remote control capabilities via apps so that it’s easy for anyone to stay comfortable no matter where they are!
