## Resetting LG Refrigerator Errors the Right Way

Any household appliance has the potential to malfunction at times, and the LG refrigerator is no exception. Fortunately, knowing how to reset LG refrigerator errors is not hard, and it can often save you the trouble and expense of dealing with an appliance repair person. 

The first step in resetting an LG refrigerator is to unplug it from the outlet. Once the refrigerator is unplugged let it sit for at least 5 minutes so it has time to cool down. This will help reset the system and clear any residual errors. 

Once the refrigerator has had a chance to cool down and reset, plug it back in and press the “Reset” button. The location of this button varies depending on your model. You can also access and reset specific settings by pressing the “Options/Settings” button on the display panel. If the issue still persists, you can attempt a factory reset by pressing the Settings and Filter buttons at the same time.

If all else fails, resetting the fridge to its factory settings can be done though the onboard menu. Navigate to the Factory Data Reset menu and follow the on-screen instructions. This option should only be used as a last resort as it will reset the entire appliance, erasing any user settings you had previously set.

Taking the time to reset your refrigerator will often solve many issues, potentially saving you from dealing with expensive repair bills. If you are still having trouble and need more assistance, you can easily find reputable appliance repair services in your area.

In order to get the most from your household appliances, it is important to understand how to use and maintain them. For more information on how to properly maintain and understand your appliances, be sure to check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
