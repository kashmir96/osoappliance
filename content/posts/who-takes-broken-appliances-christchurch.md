# Who takes broken appliances christchurch

If you live in Christchurch, New Zealand and have unwanted broken appliances, you may be wondering who to turn to for help. Fortunately, there are a variety of options available to you to help get rid of those old and broken appliances without having to take them to the local landfill. 

One option is to take the appliance to a recycling centre or scrap metal dealer. Most local scrap metal dealers will accept broken appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves and air conditioners, and turn them into usable materials. This is a great way to dispose of your appliance as it helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. 

Another option is to donate your broken appliance to a local charity. Many charities in Christchurch accept appliance donations and will either use them for their own purposes or work with a recycler to give them a new life. This is a great way to extend the life of your appliance and help the environment. 

You can also contact a local appliance repair service. Many repair services specialize in broken appliances and can often fix them at an affordable cost. This is a great way to get your appliance up and running again, rather than having to buy a new one. 

Finally, you can also try to sell your broken appliance. There are a number of online marketplaces, such as Trade Me, where you can list your appliance and see if anyone is interested in buying it. This can be a great way to get some money back for your broken appliance and put it to good use. 

No matter what you decide to do, there are a number of ways to get rid of your broken appliances in Christchurch. Whether you choose to donate, recycle, repair, or sell, you can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and help the environment.
