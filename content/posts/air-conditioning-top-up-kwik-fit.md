As temperatures rise in the summer months, having a functioning air conditioning system in your car can become vital. Sadly, air conditioning systems must be regularly topped up to keep them cool and effective; over time, they can become less efficient as the coolant used within them slowly evaporates.

At Kwik Fit, we provide a comprehensive air conditioning top up service that can help you stay comfortable during hot spells. Whether you’re driving in the height of summer or the depths of winter, an air con top up from Kwik Fit will ensure your car is always operating at its best. 

How does an air con top-up work? 
Firstly our technicians will check your vehicle’s AC system for leaks or blockages that could affect performance before recharging it with new gas and oil if needed. This helps to improve efficiency and reduce any potential long-term damage caused by low levels of coolant over time. As part of this process, we also check for any other issues such as worn parts that may need to be replaced-- this is particularly important if you have been experiencing strange noises or vibrations while running your AC system. 

Once everything has been checked and serviced if necessary our technicians will refill the refrigerant gas in your vehicle's AC system with fresh fluid straight from our stock bottles—this ensures there is no contamination in the mix which could cause further problems down the line. Finally they will put together a full report outlining their findings ready for you to take away with you should future servicing prove necessary. 

 Air conditioners are essential components of modern vehicles so it’s important to keep them well maintained all year round! At Kwik Fit we provide comprehensive top-ups for all types of cars and vans so why not book an appointment today? You won't regret it!
