## Resolving GE Oven Error Code F200

Are you receiving an Error Code F200 when attempting to use your GE oven? This error can indicate a few different problems, so before attempting to locate the root cause of the issue, it's important to understand the different things that could be going wrong. Should you need help troubleshooting and resolving the Error Code F200, read on for more information on how to fix the problem and why it's important to have your oven serviced if all other attempts fail.

The Error Code F200 stands for a problem with the oven's electronic temperature control. This could be due to a few different factors. Common problems include a broken temperature sensor, faulty oven control board, or a faulty relay switch. The temperature sensor monitors the temperature inside the oven and sends signals to the oven's control board when it's time to heat up or cool down. The control board processes these signals and monitors the ovenâ€™s temperature. A faulty relay switch can cause the oven to not get enough power, and therefore not be able to regulate the temperature properly.

To determine what the exact cause of the Error Code F200 is, it's important to inspect all the components in the oven. The temperature sensor, oven control board, and power relay should all be tested and seen if they are functioning at the required level. A technician may need to take a look at the oven to make sure that the issue is identified and fixed properly.

When dealing with a GE oven, it's important to understand the error codes and how to fix them. The F200 is a sign that there is an electronic temperature control issue that needs to be addressed. By using the provided troubleshooting tips and bringing in a technician for repair work, this error can be solved quickly and efficiently.
