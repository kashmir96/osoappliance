Sabbath mode, also known as Shabbos mode, is a setting found on many ovens that allows the appliance to be used in accordance with Jewish dietary laws. This setting is designed to turn off certain features of the oven such as lights and sounds and prevent it from being operated during the Sabbath.

The concept of Sabbath mode has its roots in Jewish religious tradition. According to the Torah, Jews are not allowed to perform any kind of work on the Sabbath, which is from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. This includes cooking or baking food. To comply with this rule, many ovens have a special setting that will turn off certain features such as lights and sounds and prevent the oven from being operated during this time period.

This feature is especially useful for observant Jews who want to ensure they are following religious law while still being able to use their ovens. It also makes it easier for them to avoid accidentally turning on their ovens during the Sabbath, which could be considered a violation of religious law.

Sabbath mode can be found on many different types of ovens including electric, gas, and convection models. The exact features that are disabled may vary depending on the model but generally include lights, sounds, and timers. Some models may also have additional features such as a lock-out option that prevents anyone from using the oven during this time period.

Overall, sabbath mode is an important feature for observant Jews who wish to adhere to their religious beliefs while still being able to use their ovens without worry or fear of accidentally violating religious law.
