Maintaining your air conditioning system is one of the most important things you can do to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively. Regular maintenance will not only help you save money on energy costs, but it will also keep your family comfortable and safe. Here are some best practices for air conditioning maintenance. 

1. Change Your Air Filter Regularly: The most important step in maintaining your air conditioner is to change the filter regularly. Dirty filters reduce airflow, resulting in greater strain on your system and higher energy bills. Change the filter every 1-3 months depending on how often you use your AC system, or according to manufacturer instructions. 

2. Clean the Coils: The evaporator and condenser coils are responsible for cooling the air in your home, so it’s important to keep them clean for optimal performance. To clean these coils, use a soft brush attachment on a vacuum cleaner to remove any dirt or debris from their surfaces before wiping them down with a damp cloth or a coil cleaning solution from a local hardware store. 

3. Inspect Electrical Connections: Make sure all electrical connections are secure and free of corrosion by inspecting them regularly and tightening any loose connections as needed (or replacing corroded ones). This is especially important if you have an older model AC system that may be more prone to electrical wiring issues over time due to wear and tear from regular use. 

4. Check Refrigerant Levels: Low levels of refrigerant can cause decreased cooling efficiency and higher energy bills, so make sure they’re at the proper levels before running your unit each season by having an HVAC professional check them every year or two (or more if needed). 

5. Have It Serviced Annually: Having an annual inspection performed by a professional HVAC technician can help uncover any potential issues with your system before they become bigger problems down the line (and costlier repairs). During this service period, have any necessary repairs made promptly as well as having general maintenance performed such as cleaning coils, changing filters, checking refrigerant lines/levels etc., all of which should help improve efficiency over time and extend the life of your AC unit too! 

By following these best practices for air conditioner maintenance, you can ensure that your system remains in good working order and keeps your home cool and comfortable all year long!
