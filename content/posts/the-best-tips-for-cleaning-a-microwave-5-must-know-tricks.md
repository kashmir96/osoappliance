## Clean Your Microwave Quickly With These Tips
Many of us use our microwaves every day; they make it easier to cook food quickly and to reheat dishes. But all that usage can lead to a build-up of food, grease and grime within your appliance. Don’t worry—cleaning your microwave doesn't have to be a chore. Here are 5 important tips to help you give your microwave the attention it needs.

### 1. Start with a Damp Paper Towel

This is the simplest way to give your microwave a quick clean. Whenever you use the appliance, wipe down the inside with a damp paper towel or cloth. This will help keep your microwave cleaner for longer.

### 2. Use Baking Soda and Vinegar

If your microwave needs more thorough cleaning, use a combination of baking soda and vinegar. Mix a few tablespoons of baking soda with some water in a microwave-safe bowl and place it inside the appliance. Heat on high for a few minutes before adding a cup of vinegar. This will create steam that will help to loosen food particles and other residue. 

### 3. Take Out the Tray 

Most modern microwaves have a turntable tray which can be removed and washed with soapy water. This will help to prevent the accumulation of food particles that can rot and smell bad.

### 4. Use a Specialist Cleaning Product

If you want the best results use a specialist cleaning product designed specifically for cleaning microwaves. These cleaners usually come in aerosol cans and can be sprayed directly onto the surfaces to remove grease and other residue. 

### 5. Use a Toothbrush

For those hard-to-reach areas, use a toothbrush and your cleaning solution of choice. Be careful with metal parts such as the magnetron—these should not be scrubbed.

Cleaning your microwave is not a difficult task but it is important to keep it in good condition. Following the tips above will help you to keep your appliance looking and smelling fresh.

By making sure that your microwave is clean and well maintained, you can ensure that it lasts for many years.
