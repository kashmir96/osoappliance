## Diagnosing Your Samsung Washing Machine Error Code SC

One of the biggest headaches for any owner of a household appliance comes with the dreaded error message. Among these error codes one that might occasionally appear in Samsung Washing Machines is 'SC'. Understanding what this code means is key to returning your appliance to its former glory.

The error code SC is an indication that there is a problem with the water temp sensor. The water temperature sensor is responsible for measuring the temperature of the incoming water and is able to adjust the washing settings accordingly. If any issues are detected with this sensor then the machine displays error code SC. This is mostly caused when the pipe isn’t connected properly and will require some diagnosis to be done so the water can be heated up properly.

If this error code appears it is best to first check to see whether the water pipe connection is secure. If that doesn’t help the issue, then the water temperature sensor will require checking and it might even need replacement. After the issue has been fixed the power should be switched off and then on again which resets the error.
