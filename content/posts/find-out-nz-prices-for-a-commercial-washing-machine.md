## Discover NZ Pricing for Commercial Washers
When you’re looking for a great commercial washing machine for a business, you need one that suits both your budget and your needs. Fortunately, there are plenty of options available in New Zealand and the prices can vary considerably depending on the make and model. 

Whether you’re looking for something to do an industrial-strength wash of your linens, a heavy-duty washer for a busy hospitality or healthcare setting, or a multi-load machine for apartment complexes, you’ll have plenty to choose from. 

Some of the top brands in commercial washing machines in New Zealand include Fisher & Paykel, LG,Electrolux, Maytag, and Whirlpool. Prices can start fairly low at around $1400, but you can expect to pay anywhere from $2500 to over $7000 depending on the brand, features, and load capacity you’re looking for.

For businesses, buying a commercial washer is an important decision and a big financial commitment. It’s usually best to speak to a specialist appliance supplier to make sure you’re getting the best possible deal on your washing machine. A specialist supplier should be aware of the best discounts and special offers, such as trade-in offers or package deals that include accessories and parts. 

Don’t forget to factor in the running costs and energy efficiency of the machine too – the more energy efficient a machine is, the less it will cost to run. Generally speaking, front-load machines are more efficient and consume less water and energy, plus they’re more space-efficient. 

Whether you’re replacing an ageing washing machine or installing a brand new machine, take your time to shop around and compare prices to find the best deal.
