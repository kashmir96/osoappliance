Tablets for dishwashers are an easy and convenient way to keep your dishes sparkling clean. But before you start using them, it’s important to know where to put them in your dishwasher for the best results.

Most tablets come with a special dispenser that can be placed on the top rack of the dishwasher or near the detergent dispenser. This allows the tablet to dissolve evenly as water is sprayed during each cycle. Some tablets may also come with a clip that can be attached to the side of the dishwasher, but this isn’t always necessary.

The location of your tablet dispenser is important because it affects how much detergent is released into each cycle. If you place it too close to the heating element, it could cause too much detergent to be released and result in soapy residue on dishes or glassware. If you place it too far away from the heating element, not enough detergent will be released and dishes won’t get as clean as they should.

If your dishwasher doesn’t have a special dispenser for tablets, you can simply drop them into one of the empty racks before running a cycle. Make sure you don’t put them directly on top of any dishes or utensils, as this could cause staining or discoloration due to contact with chemicals in the tablet. 

No matter where you decide to put your tablets for dishwashers, make sure they are completely dissolved before starting a cycle and never mix different types of detergents together in one load as this could damage both your dishes and machine over time.
