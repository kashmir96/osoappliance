Harvest Right freeze dryers are a revolutionary way to preserve food. With the ability to freeze dry fruits, vegetables, meats and other goods, these machines can help you store food for up to 25 years. But in order to get the most out of your machine, it’s important to have the right accessories. Here’s a look at some of the must-have accessories for your Harvest Right freeze dryer.

The Harvest Right Vacuum Sealer: This vacuum sealer is designed specifically for use with your Harvest Right Freeze Dryer. It is perfect for sealing up your foods so that they will stay fresh longer and be protected from air and moisture damage during storage or transport. The vacuum sealer also allows you to easily package multiple servings of food that you can take with you on-the-go or store away in a pantry or freezer. 

The Mylar Bags: These special bags are designed specifically for use with your Harvest Right Freeze Dryer and allow you to quickly package multiple servings of food that can be stored away in a pantry or freezer. Mylar bags provide superior protection against oxygen, light and moisture damage while still allowing air circulation which helps keep foods fresher longer. 

The Silica Gel Canister: This unique accessory helps absorb any remaining moisture in the air after freeze drying has occurred helping ensure maximum shelf life when storing products long term in airtight containers such as mason jars or buckets lined with mylar bags. Simply place this small container inside any container being used for storage and it will go about its job silently helping protect from moisture damage over time! 

These are just some of the many great accessories available with Harvest Right Freeze Dryers! With these additions, you’ll be able to maximize the longevity of all preserved foods while having peace-of-mind knowing that all your hard work won't go bad before you're ready to enjoy it!
