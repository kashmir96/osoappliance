## Resetting a Dryer Sensor for Better Performance
If you're a homeowner with a dryer, there are many benefits that come with knowing how to properly reset the sensor. Knowing how to reset the sensor can help you save money in energy costs and extend the life of your dryer. This guide will help you learn how to reset the sensor and get the most out of your dryer. 

When you purchase a new dryer, the sensor will already be calibrated to the correct settings. However, if your dryer is not drying your clothes properly or runs for too long, it may be necessary to recalibrate the sensor. The sensor helps regulate the internal temperature of the dryer and if it is not calibrated correctly, it can lead to longer drying times and higher energy costs. 

To reset the sensor, you will need a thermometer and a flathead screwdriver. First, turn off the power to the dryer and remove the back panel of the dryer by removing the screws from the panel. Once the panel has been removed, locate the sensor in the back of the dryer and unplug the two wires connected to the sensor. Then, use the screwdriver to turn the screws clockwise to increase the temperature. Make sure you don't turn the screws too far, since doing this may cause the dryer to overheat. 

After the screws are adjusted, replace the two wires, plug in the dryer, and turn the dryer on. Next, take the thermometer and place it in the exhaust vent after the drying cycle. The thermometer should measure a temperature between 150 and 160 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature is too low, increase the temperature of the screws just a bit more and test the temperature again. Once the thermometer reads the correct temperature, you have properly reset the sensor in your dryer. 

Knowing how to reset the sensor in your dryer is a great skill to have and can save you money in energy costs. If you have difficulty resetting the sensor, it is recommended to contact a professional to help.
