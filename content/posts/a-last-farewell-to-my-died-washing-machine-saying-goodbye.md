## Saying Goodbye to an Old Friend

Your washing machine was like a best friend. It was there for you every week, day in and day out. It was a faithful companion who never seemed to tire of doing the same laundry task over and over. Sadly, the time has come to bid a fond farewell to your trusty old washing machine. 

You wake up one day and the washing machine won’t turn on. You immediately realize what has happened and feel a deep sense of sorrow. You tell yourself that things like this happen and try to accept it, but it isn’t easy. After all, you’d been together for so long. 

You go through the grieving process as you prepare to surrender your washing machine to the unknown. You’re grateful for all the times it got you through a particularly rough load, but you can’t help but feel a bit of bitterness. Shouldn’t it have lasted another few years?

Not to worry though, because it’s time to look forward, not backwards. You’re now in the market for a new washing machine, and it’s exciting to think about all the new possibilities. The cycle options, the size, and the bells and whistles - there’s a whole new world out there! You may even find your next washing machine has features your last one didn’t even come close to.

So take a moment to mourn the passing of your old friend. It’s ok to be sad and it’s ok to be excited. It’s hard to say goodbye but life moves on. Find solace in the knowledge that you’ll soon have a new washing machine, and it will likely bring a wealth of new rewards into your life.
