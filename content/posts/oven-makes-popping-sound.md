If you’ve ever heard a loud popping sound coming from your oven, don’t worry – it isn’t anything to be concerned about. This sound is usually caused by the expansion and contraction of metal parts as the oven heats up.

When heating up, an electric oven will often make a popping or snapping sound. This is usually caused by air pockets inside the heating element expanding as they are heated and then contracting as they cool down again. This sound can also be caused by thermal expansion of other parts such as hinges or grates in gas ovens. While a bit startling, this is generally normal and nothing to worry about. 

However, if you have an issue with your oven making an unusual noise that continues after it has been heated up for some time, you may want to try some basic troubleshooting before calling for help from an appliance repair service person listed on our directory list. 

Here are a few things you can try: 

 - Check that your fan is not blocked or obstructed in any way; if needed remove any debris that could be blocking airflow

 - If dust or grease has accumulated on either the fan or heating element of your oven clean them off using soap and water

 - Make sure all screws are tightened securely on any removable parts

 - If it only occurs when operating at high temperatures check that the temperature settings have not been set too high 

If none of these steps solve the problem then it may be time to seek out professional help from one of our appliance repair service persons on our directory list who can investigate further and handle any necessary repairs quickly and efficiently!
