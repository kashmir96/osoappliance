## Solving an F12 Error Code in Your Oven
If you own an oven, a common issue you may experience is getting an error code that reads "F12." This error code usually means the oven is failing to heat sufficiently. To troubleshoot this issue, here are a few simple steps that can help.

First, check the temperature settings and make sure they are correct for the recipe you’re attempting to cook. If the settings are correct, you may want to also check the timer setting to make sure it is set properly. If that doesn’t pinpoint the issue, then it may be electrical in nature. 

Next, unplug the oven and check that all the electrical connections are secure and not damaged. You may also want to check the fuse box to make sure the fuse associated with the oven is working. If all the connections appear to be secure, try replacing the oven’s temperature sensor, which can often be the cause of the error code.
