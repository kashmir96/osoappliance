## Is Using an Air Purifier Unknowingly Putting You at Risk?

When you bring a new air purifier home to combat poor air quality in your home, you expect it to improve your living environment--not cause you harm. However, using air purifiers have the potential to cause unexpected risks. It is important to research any appliances you bring into your home and be aware of the potential dangers they may come with. In this blog, we will discuss the dangers of air purifiers and tips to use them safely. 

The main concern with air purifiers is the filters for catching particles and allergens. Depending on the quality of the filter, it can become clogged over time, causing particulate matter to become trapped in the device. This can become a contaminant in the air and make air quality worse than before. Additionally, the filter, if not properly replaced, can also become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria, which is especially dangerous for individuals with breathing problems, such as asthma.

The particles that air purifiers collect also require proper disposal. The collected particles will contain allergen that can easily become airborne again and reenter your home if not disposed of correctly. Furthermore, many air purifiers generate ozone while they filter the air, which can irritate the lungs and cause chest pains. 

It is important to practice caution and follow manufacturer instructions when using an air purifier. Making sure to use the right filter and replacing it regularly is essential. Additionally, always read product reviews, as some cheap air purifiers are not energy efficient or effective.

It's important to stay informed of the risks air purifiers may come with, as unknowingly using an air purifier can lead to worse air quality and breathing issues. Always do your research and use caution when using an appliance.

## Is Air Purifier Use Really Harmful? 

### 1. What makes air purifiers dangerous?
Air purifiers can be a potential danger if they are emitting harmful particles instead of purifying the air. UV lights in some purifiers, for example, can produce ozone, a known lung irritant. Other particulate matter can be released such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that cause allergies or respiratory problems.

### 2. Can air purifiers become moldy? 
Yes, when moisture is present, air purifiers can become moldy over time due to the combination of warm air and dust which can create a prime habitat for mold. It is important to clean or replace air filter regularly and to maintain good air circulation by regularly opening windows and doors.

### 3. Can air purifiers cause allergies? 
Yes, air purifiers can cause allergies in some people due to the particles emitted in the machine. Particles such as dust and pet dander can accumulate over time and become hazardous, causing persistent sneezing, watery eyes, and nasal congestion.

### 4. Does an air purifier have to be certified? 
Yes, to ensure the quality of an air purifier it should have been tested and certified according to standards set by global organizations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). These standards measure filtration efficiency, air changes per hour, noise, and other factors.

### 5. Do all air purifiers filter allergens? 
No, not all air purifiers are designed to filter allergens from the air. Some filter out dust, smoke and other airborne particles, but not necessarily allergens that are inhaled in the air. To filter out allergens, look for an air purifier with a HEPA filter.
