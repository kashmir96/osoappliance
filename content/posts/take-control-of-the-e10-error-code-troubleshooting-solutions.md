## Understanding and Troubleshooting the E10 Error Code

An E10 error code can cause frustration and confusion. This error code typically indicates an issue with the water supply - either with pressure or temperature. Luckily, troubleshooting solutions make it easier to take control of the E10 error code and make sure appliances are operating correctly.

Understanding where the E10 error code originates from is the first step to solving the issue. Most washers, dishwashers, and other household appliances monitor water pressure, temperature, and flow in order to complete the required job. If one of these variables drops or increases then the appliance will display an error code, such as E10.

The most common cause of an E10 code is a lack of water flow. This means the there isn't enough water flowing in to the appliance. This can be caused by either a blockage of water somewhere in the supply pipeline or a closed solenoid valve.

The level of incoming water pressure should also be checked, as it can also cause an E10 error code. Ideally, the pressure should be more than 14 pounds per inch sq. If it’s below this level then the appliance will display an error code.

Once the source of the E10 error code has been identified, it’s time to start troubleshooting. If the reason is a lack of flow or pressure then your first port of call is checking for any blockages in the supply pipe. Otherwise, a closed solenoid valve may be the cause and will need to opened.

If there’s a problem with the water temperature, then the most likely cause is old hoses. If the hoses are more than six years old then they should be replaced, as hoses are susceptible to damage over time.

At times, it’s not possible to identify the root cause of an E10 error code. If this is the case, it’s best to contact a [professional appliance technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to come and assess the problem.

Taking control of the E10 error code is as easy as identifying the source of the issue and then attempting to troubleshoot it. If the cause of the error can be identified then resolving the issue can often be simple. On the other hand, if the problem is too difficult to diagnose, then it’s best to call in a professional.

Don't let the E10 error code stop you from using your appliances. Take control of the problem now by leveraging the troubleshooting solutions outlined above.
