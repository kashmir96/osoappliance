The biggest oven capacity you can get in the kitchen today is a double oven. A double oven has two separate ovens, each with its own set of controls and settings, allowing you to cook multiple dishes at once. The larger of the two ovens is typically around 4 cubic feet in size, making it one of the largest single-oven appliances available.

Not only does a double oven provide more cooking space than a single-oven model, but it also offers greater versatility in your cooking options. You can use the larger side for roasts or large dishes that require longer cooking times and high temperatures, while the smaller side is perfect for quick meals like pizzas or casseroles that don't need as much heat or time. Plus, with two separate settings for each side of the oven—one for baking and one for broiling—you can choose exactly which type of heat you need to get just the right results on whatever dish you're making.

A double oven may be ideal if you have a large family or entertain often and need extra capacity to keep up with meal preparation demands. It's also an excellent choice if space isn't an issue since it takes up less room than having two separate wall units installed in your kitchen (though some models are stackable). And because they're self-contained units that don’t require additional ventilation like range cooktops do, they make great additions to any kitchen where ventilation isn't an option due to design restrictions or lack of windows. 

No matter what your needs are when it comes to baking and roasting in your home kitchen, a double-oven will give you maximum space and flexibility so that you can create delicious meals without having to worry about running out of room!
