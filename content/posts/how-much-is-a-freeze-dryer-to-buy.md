A freeze dryer is a specialty piece of equipment used to quickly and effectively remove moisture from products, making them lightweight and easy to store. Freeze dryers can be used for a variety of applications, including food preservation, medical sample preparation, and even space exploration. The cost of a freeze dryer can vary greatly depending on size and features; simple tabletop models can range from around $2,000 to upwards of $20,000 for larger industrial units.

At the lower end of the market are small tabletop models, typically ranging in size from 6-12 inches wide with capacities between 1-10 pounds per hour. These are perfect for small home operations or lab settings such as colleges or research facilities who don’t need an overly powerful machine—just a reliable one that’s easy to use. Prices start at around $2,000 but can go up depending on features like programmable settings or digital readouts. 

On the higher end you’ll find commercial grade freeze dryers which offer significantly greater capacity and faster drying times than their smaller counterparts—often up to hundreds of pounds an hour! Not only do these machines provide better performance but they also tend to have more features such as automated systems with timers and alarms which can be programmed for specific drying processes. Prices start at around $15-20K but again this is dependent on size/capacity along with other features like stainless steel construction or integrated cooling systems. 

For those looking for something in between those two extremes there are mid-grade versions available too—typically offering capacities between 20-60 pounds per hour at prices starting around $10K. Again these come with varying levels of additional features such as digital readouts or programmable settings so it pays to shop around for the best deal if you’re looking at this option! 

Overall it's clear that buying a freeze dryer is not something most people will do casually - both price wise as well as technical considerations should be taken into account when choosing one - but if you need effective moisture removal then they offer great performance at reasonable costs (even if those costs may still seem high!).
