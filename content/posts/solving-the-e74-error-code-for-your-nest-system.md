## What to do When You Encounter the E74 Error Code on Your Nest System 

The Nest Thermostat is a popular choice for many homeowners. It's smart, programmable, and can even learn patterns and preferences to save you energy and money. But like all devices, it can encounter issues and one of the most common ones is the dreaded E74 error code. If you're encountering this issue, don't worry! Here's how to troubleshoot and quickly fix the issue.

First, restart the device. Unplug the Nest from the wall and wait at least 7 seconds before plugging it back in. If the error still persists, then it could be because you need to update your Nest software. To do this, sign into your Nest app and navigate to the settings. From there, select the option to update the software. It may take some time to download and install, but this might be enough to resolve the error.

If restarting and updating the software doesn't fix the problem, then it's likely that there's an issue with the hardware. To fix this, unplug the device and take off the cover. Inside, you'll see a thin ribbon cable connecting the main board to the display. Make sure this cable is connected and secure. If it appears loose, carefully push it back into place.

If the cable appears to be secure, you may need to replace the display board. This can easily be done and most stores with stock the necessary components.

No matter the issue, it's important to always take safety precautions when dealing with electrical components.
