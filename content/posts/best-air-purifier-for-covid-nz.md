The Covid-19 pandemic has created a heightened need for air purifiers across the world. With the virus being airborne, it is important to have clean air circulating throughout your home or workplace in order to protect yourself and those around you.

Fortunately, there are many air purifiers on the market that can help reduce the risk of airborne viruses. In New Zealand, we have a variety of options available to suit all budgets and needs.

2) The Blueair Classic 480i Air Purifier is another great option if you’re looking for something with extra power but still want something affordable.

It also has quiet operation and an energy efficiency rating of A+ making it kinder on both your wallet and ears!
