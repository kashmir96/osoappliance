## Reinvigorate an Old Fridge to Get More Lifespan and Less Waste

When it comes time to replace the old kitchen fridge, many of us consider it trash with no other options. But there are plenty of creative possibilities for your abandoned refrigerator that don’t require a landfill. Reinvigorating an old fridge can get you more life, longer use, and help reduce waste.

Many people have used their old fridges as a place to store canned food and other non-perishable items. This can be especially useful if you have an extra refrigerator in your home or garage but don’t have enough room in your regular fridge. It’s also a great way to utilize an old fridge if the refrigerator’s compressor has stopped working. You can then stock the fridge up with canned or other non-perishable items and the refrigerator will keep them cool and organized.

Another option is to repurpose the fridge itself into furniture or a decoration. Homeowners often use the outside of an old fridge to make a unique piece of backyard art or a cool planter. You can also sand down and paint the refrigerator for an entirely new look. Refrigerators can also be transformed into end tables, armoires, and other pieces of furniture with some careful planning and creativity.

You can also repurpose your leftover refrigerator parts and components. Old tubing, insulation and other pieces of a refrigerator can be used in furniture-making and craft projects. The insulation of the refrigerator, especially the Styrofoam, is also a great material to use for creative projects with children.

With a little imagination, you can repurpose and recycle your old fridge into a useful repurposed item instead of simply throwing it out. Refurbishing an old refrigerator can reduce waste and help make use of materials that otherwise would just be dumped into the landfill.
