## Diagnosing and Resolving the 23 c Error Code on Your Samsung Fridge

Are you the proud owner of a Samsung refrigerator, but have recently been experiencing a 23 c error code? Don't panic! This error code is not indicative of a larger issue; rather, it is simply signaling that there is something askew with how your refrigerator and freezer temperature policies are set up. In most cases, this issue can be resolved in just a few steps.

First, it’s important to remember that the numerical codes and letters provided by Samsung operate on a zero-based system. That is, the 23 c error code is equivalent to the C3 code. Now, to diagnose and resolve the issue, you must access the refrigerators control panel. You can do so by pressing the “ESC” or “Control” button that is so clearly indicated on the fridge itself.

Once you have entered the control panel, you’ll need to locate the settings that regulate temperature and adjust them accordingly. This will involve finding the settings labeled “Freezer Mode” and setting it to either “Arctic” or “Deep Freeze”. Additionally, you’ll have to change the refrigerator’s settings to “Max Cool”. Once both settings have been established, select the “Start” button to apply these changes.

If the error persists once the settings have been adjusted, you may have an issue with the actual temperature sensors within the refrigerator. It is important to take caution in this situation and reach out to a certified technician for further information.

Adhering to manufacturer guidelines and warranty conditions can go a long way in preventing errors from occurring. If you’re in the market for a new refrigerator, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to see what well-suited option is available for you!
