## What is the Most Common Washing Machine Fault?
It is important for regular users of household appliances to be aware of the most common faults with their washing machine in the unfortunate event that an issue arises. Knowing what the issue may be in advance can greatly reduce the stress and hassle of having to deal with a malfunctioning appliance. 

The most common washing machine fault is an error code. Error codes are generated when something within a machineâ€™s operating system or components needs to be checked, serviced, or replaced. Error codes should never be ignored as this can result in a bigger issue arising if the fault is not fixed. Depending on the type of error code shown, the issue could vary from a simple, inexpensive fix such as resetting the appliance or taking a look at the water supply, to more complex and expensive troubleshooting with regards to the internal electronics and parts.

If your washing machine is displaying an error code and you are unsure what the issue is, you can use a comprehensive appliance error codes glossary to help you find a solution. A comprehensive glossary will detail commonly found error codes and any associated faults, as well as recommended solutions. This kind of resource can save you plenty of time and money, as it eliminates the guess work of attempting to discover the cause of the issue. 

With any appliance, regular maintenance is key to ensuring its longevity. Taking the extra time to carry out routine check ups - such as making sure the filters are clear and the drainage is working properly - can go a long way to keep your washing machine in the best working condition.

In the event of an issue with your washing machine, the most common fault is an error code. It is highly important that error codes are attended to as soon as possible to avoid any further damage or expense.
