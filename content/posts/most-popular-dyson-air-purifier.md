Dyson air purifiers are some of the most advanced and effective air purification systems on the market. From their iconic tower design to their cutting-edge filtration technology, Dyson has created a range of top-of-the-line air purifiers that can help improve the indoor air quality in your home or office. With so many models to choose from, it can be difficult to know which one is best for your needs. To help you decide, we’ve put together a guide that outlines some of the most popular Dyson air purifier models and what makes them stand out. 

The Dyson Pure Cool Link is one of the most popular models in the lineup and it packs a variety of features into its slim tower design. This model includes an intelligent filter system that captures up to 99.97% of allergens, pollutants, and bacteria as small as 0.3 microns in size from your indoor environment. It also features an LCD display which provides real-time updates on indoor air quality levels, so you can keep track of how clean your home or office is at any time. Additionally, this model comes with both Wi-Fi connectivity and Amazon Alexa compatibility so you can control it remotely using voice commands or through a compatible smartphone app. 

For those who need more powerful filtration capabilities, the Dyson Pure Hot + Cool Link offers an upgraded version of this model’s filtration system along with additional features such as room heating and cooling functions for added comfort all year round. This model also has built-in sensors that detect pollution levels within your space and adjust fan speed accordingly for maximum efficiency – perfect for those living in smoggy cities where outdoor pollution levels are high! Plus – like its predecessor – it connects to Wi-Fi networks and Amazon Alexa devices for easy remote control access from anywhere in your home or office. 

For those looking for something more compact than a full tower unit but still packed with top performance features, then look no further than the Dyson Pure Cool Me Personal Purifying Fan . This ultra slim fan has been designed specifically to provide targeted personal cooling while also filtering out 99% airborne particles as small as 0.1 microns from surrounding areas up to 15 meters away! Plus – thanks to its unique oscillating design – it can provide both vertical and horizontal airflow depending on where you’re sitting or standing at any given time making it great for use around multiple people at once without compromising performance power! 

 Finally – if you’re after something even smaller yet still capable of efficient cleaning then check out the hand held Dyson V7 Trigger Pro Cordless Vacuum Cleaner . While this may not be specifically designed as an air purifier like other models listed here – what sets this apart is its powerful suction capabilities which allow it pick up dirt particles deep within carpets fibers while simultaneously removing dust particles floating around in midair making it great all round household cleaner/purifier hybrid device!
