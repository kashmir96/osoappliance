## Examining the Risks of Using Microwaves

Is microwave use really a risk to our health? The answer may surprise you. Microwave ovens are a staple of quick meal prep in many kitchens, but finding out how microwave radiation interacts with other food components has led many to re-evaluate their use of microwaves today. 

Our body is composed of water and other cells, much like the food we eat. It only makes sense that microwaves cause some type of biological change when we heat up food. Microwave ovens generate radiation that transfers to the food and can be significantly higher in energy than that found in natural sunlight. It's been found that microwave radiation can have destructive effects on various forms of nutrients in food. 

With radio frequency radiation, the quantity and physical structure of food components can be drastically changed. This can affect the levels of vitamins, minerals, and proteins. An example of radio frequency radiation affecting food components is with the nutrient lycopene, which when exposed to radiation at levels that can be found in a microwave, its antioxidant activity can be reduced or eliminated. 

Radiation can even damage the environment surrounding our food. For instance, radiation can affect living organisms such as bacteria. One study of the radiation that is produced from a microwave oven found that zones of inhibition against the E. coli bacteria were measured around the microwaved chicken. 

It's not just the internal components that microwave radiation affects. In some cases it can weaken the bond found between the microwave and its immediate environment. This could cause openings that let electromagnetic radiation pass through, which could be an additional risk to our health. 

Re-evaluating our use of microwaves is important. While microwaves can be a great way to heat food quickly and easily, understanding the risks and issues that can arise when microwaving food should help you make an informed decision about how to safely and effectively use them when preparing meals. 

Taking a few precautions can help to lessen the risks associated with microwaves. These can include limiting exposure time or avoiding microwaving of liquids and certain types of foods. If you need help making sure your microwave is functioning properly, our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) provides a great resource to find qualified techs in your area.

## Uncovering the Dangers of Microwaves 

1. **What are the risks associated with using microwaves?**

Microwaves have been found to emit radiation that can alter our DNA and reduce the potential of nutrients from food, potentially leading to long-term health problems such as cancer. Additionally, microwaves have been linked to increased levels of electrical fields, increased free radicals in the body, and chromosomal damage. 

2. **How can I protect myself from the risks associated with microwaves?** 

The best way to protect yourself from the risks associated with microwaves is to reduce or eliminate your exposure. Start by only using microwaves when it is absolutely necessary and be sure to keep the microwave away from young children, who are particularly vulnerable to radiation. Additionally, do not overheat food and try to only use microwaves that are not damaged and in good working order to ensure safety. 

3. **Can the risks associated with microwaves be prevented?** 

The risks associated with microwaves can be minimized, but cannot be completely prevented while using a microwave. The best ways to reduce the risk of radiation exposure and health problems is to limit your use of a microwave and to make sure your microwave is properly maintained and in good working order. 

4. **What are the signs of radiation sickness from microwaves?**

The signs of radiation sickness from microwaves can vary and can be similar to other conditions. Some of the signs of radiation sickness from microwaves can include nausea, vomiting, fever, fatigue, hair loss, skin irritation, decrease in white blood cells, and an increased risk of cancer. 

5. **Is it safe to consume food cooked in a microwave?**

It is generally safe to consume food cooked in a microwave, however, it is important to note that the nutrients in food cooked in a microwave may be reduced. Additionally, when cooking food in a microwave, it is important to make sure the food is cooked evenly and at a safe temperature to minimize any health risks associated with microwave radiation.

## Key Takeaways on Microwave Radiation 
- Microwaves generate radiation that can be significantly higher in energy than natural sunlight
- Microwave radiation can cause destructive effects on nutrients such as lycopene and other vitamins, minerals, and proteins 
- Radiation can affect surrounding food and organisms like bacteria 
- Bonding between a microwave and its environment can be weakened, resulting in openings where electromagnetic radiation can pass through 
- Re-evaluating our use of microwaves can help to minimise risks and ensure safe, efficient use when preparing meals
