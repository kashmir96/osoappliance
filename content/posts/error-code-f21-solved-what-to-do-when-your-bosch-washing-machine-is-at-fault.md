## Troubleshooting Your Bosch Washing Machine Error Code F21

Are you seeing the Error Code F21 appear on your Bosch Washing Machine? Don't panic, you're not alone, and help is at hand. In this post, we'll help you identify and resolve this error to get your washing machine functioning normally once again. 

When the F21 error code appears, it usually means that water sustainability or drainage is being interfered with. One of the most common issues is a drainage pump issue, where the drainage filter may be blocked, the drain hoses could be bent or kinked, or the outlet pipes may be blocked. 

Before you start troubleshooting and attempting to correct the issue, first make sure you turn off the washing machineâ€™s water supply and power for safety. 

You'll want to start by cleaning the drainage filters. Firstly, take off the back panel of your Bosch Washing machine and feel for any blockages. If you find any, try to run the filters under hot water to unblock them. Reinstall the panel and power on the washing machine. Whilst the washing machine is turned on, be sure to check for any water leakage.If the problem persists, try to use a vacuum cleaner to remove any more blockages from the pipes. 

Next, check the existing drain hose by feeling it. If there are any kinks or blockages, straighten them. You may also need to remove the drain hose to check the outlet pipe, ensure that it is not blocked, and if it is, you may need to unblock it.

Once all the checks are complete and the necessary actions have been taken, try to run a test cycle. If the error code is still displaying, unfortunately, it may be time to contact a professional engineer who can help to fix the issue.

In conclusion, fixing the Error Code F21 issue on your Bosch Washing Machine can be done relatively simply. By following the steps above, you can identify and resolve the problem quickly and easily.
