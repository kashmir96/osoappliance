## Enjoy Tasty Meals with an Electric Oven

When you’re thinking of ways to make a delicious dinner with minimal effort and ingredients, an electric oven is a great tool to have. An electric oven provides the ability to bake, cook, and roast whole meals with ease. With a few simple recipes, an electric oven can produce amazing dishes in a fraction of the time.

One of the simplest meals to make with an electric oven is roasted vegetables. All vegetables can be roasted with a minimal amount of effort. Simply preheat the oven to 375 degrees, cut up your desired vegetables, toss them in your favorite herbs and spices, then place them on an oven-safe tray and cook for 15-20 minutes. Your vegetables will be cooked and full of flavor in no time.

Lasagna is another delicious meal that electric ovens make easier. To assemble the lasagna, layer lasagna noodles, sauce, vegetables, cheese, and any other desired toppings. After your ramekin, dish, or pan is full, cover it up and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. Once the dish is golden brown, it’s ready to be served and enjoyed.

Pepperoni-stuffed mushrooms are another easy and delicious electric oven meal. Simply preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Rinse and clean the mushrooms, then stuff them with shredded cheese and pepperoni. Place the stuffed mushrooms in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes. In just a short amount of time, your mushrooms will be cooked, gooey and ready to eat.

Electric ovens are also great for baking desserts. Whether you’re baking an apple pie or a batch of brownies, an electric oven can have your sweets ready to eat in no time. Pies, cakes, pastries and more can all be cooked and ready to be enjoyed in 30 minutes or less.

An electric oven is a great tool for any kitchen. With the right recipes and cook time, it’s easy to create simple, flavorful meals from the comfort of your home. To learn more about the best appliances for your kitchen, checkout our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
