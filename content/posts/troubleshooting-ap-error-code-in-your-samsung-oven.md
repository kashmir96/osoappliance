When your Samsung oven is displaying an "AP" error code, it can cause concern and worry. But you don't need to panic. This error code actually delivers an important message to you about possible malfunctions in your Samsung oven. With a few simple steps, you can troubleshoot the issue, and get your oven running again in no time.

The AP error code may be triggered by different problems. In some cases, the issue may be related to an internal problem with the electrical components of the oven, such as a faulty relay, main control board, or something else. In other cases, it might be caused by a part that needs to be replaced or repaired.

To begin troubleshooting the AP error code in your Samsung oven, the first step is to check the power source. Make sure the oven is plugged in securely, and also check if there is any voltage discrepancy in your home that might be causing the problem.

Next, consult your Samsung oven user manual or warranty book and check if there has been an internal malfunction or recall of your product. If so, the user manual should have a guide or instructions on how to fix the issue. 

If none of these remedies have worked, then it may be time to contact a repair technician. A qualified appliance repair technician can diagnose the issue and inform you of what parts may need to be replaced in order to get your Samsung oven up and running again.

In conclusion, troubleshooting the AP error code in your Samsung oven is relatively simple and straightforward. Make sure your oven is plugged in accurately and consult the user manual or look for recall information.
