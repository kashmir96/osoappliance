## Finding Quality Advised Refurbished Commercial Dishwashers 

When your business is in need of a dishwasher, finding the right option can be a difficult process--both costly and time consuming. Buying a used or refurbished commercial dishwasher can be a smart move for both cost efficiency and a quality product. But there are some important considerations to make in order to ensure you’re getting the best available product that fits within your budget. 

When looking for a refurbished commercial dishwasher, it’s essential to start with the right manufacturer. Searching for dishwashers made by top-name manufacturers is worth the effort – not only because they will offer quality and efficiency, but they also make finding repair professionals and spare parts much easier in the future. As you search, compare both the cost to purchase and the cost to maintain the machine over time to identify both short and long-term savings.

Used dishwashers are those that have been used for some period of time, but had a former owner. Refurbished dishwashers are those that were used, often no longer in working order, taken apart, re-inspected and then put back together after any needed cleaning, replacement parts or repairs. A refurbished dishwasher needs to be thoroughly inspected to make sure it is still in proper working order, with no dangerous signs of water leakage or rust. It’s also important to confirm the warranty length and whether the parts are brand name and of good quality. 

When you’ve found the right machine, consider the no-go’s in purchasing. Avoid software upgrades that the manufacturer is offering– new software for an old machine many times can present compatibility issues. And, though it may seem trivial, make sure the spacing fits properly for the layout of your commercial kitchen. 

Buying a refurbished commercial dishwasher allows you to maintain the same quality equipment you would find in a brand-new dishwasher for a fraction of the cost. Taking the time to research reputable manufacturers and scrutinize all the details prior to purchase will lead you to the best-quality machine for your restaurant or business.

When you’ve found the perfect dishwasher and need servicing, be sure to refer to our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to get in touch with a professional and certified technician to provide all your warranty and service needs.
