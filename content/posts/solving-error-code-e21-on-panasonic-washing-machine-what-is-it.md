## Understanding Error Code E21 on Panasonic Washing Machine
If you own a Panasonic washing machine, you may come across the error code E21. Error code E21 signals an issue with the draining system of your washing machine, meaning it is struggling to drain water out of the tub and complete the cycle. There are a few ways you can rectify this problem.

To identify the task you need to do, you first need to begin with a simple troubleshooting process. Check for quick fixes, such as making sure the hose is not kinked or blocked. If that’s not the issue, you’ll need to look more closely.

Next, check the drain pump filter at the bottom of the appliance for any excess buildups of lint or debris. You can remove the filter by following the instructions detailed in your owner’s manual to eliminate blockages. Additionally, you may need to check if the drain pump or motor has become seized and needs replacing.

If the above isn’t the fix and you’ve started to observe poor draining performance, chances are your Panasonic washing machine has a fault in its electronics. It’s recommended to seek assistance from a qualified technician who can run a diagnostic test to accurately pinpoint what issue is causing the error.

Error code E21 on a Panasonic washing machine is a common issue that can be easily fixed. Many quick fixes require nothing more than a bit of maintenance and a thorough clean of the draining system. If the issue persists, a qualified technician should be sought for help to examine and diagnose the electronics of your washing machine.
