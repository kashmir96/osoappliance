### Discover the Meaning of Electrolux Washer's Flashing E
If you have an Electrolux washing machine and noticed a flashing E light, it may have you wondering what it means and how to proceed. Fortunately, the flashing E error on an Electrolux washer can be solved quickly so you can get back to washing clothes. 

The flashing E error indicates that the washer has attempted to fill with water but is unable to. This is usually a valve or pressure issue caused by a faulty inlet valve––it’s not able to open or close properly due to a build up of limescale or a faulty switch. It may also be because the filter is blocked. To fix the problem, you’ll want to check these components first and make sure that there’s no blockage or bent pipes preventing them from working properly. If the inlet valve is at fault, it’s recommended that you replace it as soon as possible. 

In other cases, the flashing E light can be problem with the washing machine’s timer or control board. This is a relatively easy fix for a qualified repair person––they will just need to inspect the wiring to make sure everything is connected properly, and then run a few tests to make sure that the board is working correctly. 

If you’re not comfortable troubleshooting the issue yourself, you can find a local Electrolux repair specialist who can come to your home and take care of it for you.
