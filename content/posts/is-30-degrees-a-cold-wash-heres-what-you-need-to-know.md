## Is Washing Clothing at 30°C Enough to Keep Them Clean?
Knowing when to use a cold wash over a hot one when doing laundry can be daunting. While it is tempting to use the highest temperature available, this can often be damaging to delicate fabrics, reducing their lifespan and, in some cases, causing them to shrink. But is a 30°C cold wash enough to keep clothes clean? Here, we will answer this important question.

When it comes to using cold water for laundry, there are some items for which a cold wash is unsatisfactory – for instance, heavily stained items or whites that are particularly discoloured. For these, a hotter temperature may be needed, in order to target the stubborn dirt and restore the colour of the fabric. 

However, for lighter-stained items and other fabrics that can be damaged from too high a temperature, a 30°C cold wash is often sufficient. This is especially the case for items with labels marking them as suitable for delicate and cool washes – such as jerseys, jeans and underwear – and with gentle cycles, they will retain their shape while remaining just as clean. In fact, studies have shown that cold washes are especially effective at ridding fabrics of pollen, dust mites and other allergens.

What’s more, washing at lower temperatures also uses less energy, saving you and the environment energy, time and money!

In conclusion, when it comes to a 30°C cold wash, you can rest assured that it is an effective way of cleaning most of your clothing. As long as you check the label on your garment, you can use the gentle cycle to keep items free from dirt and maintain the longevity of your garments.
