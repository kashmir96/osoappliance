If your dishwasher isn't cleaning dishes properly, there are a few things to consider. The most common causes of poor dishwasher performance include inadequate water temperature, blocked filters and spray arms, improper loading, and detergent buildup. 

First, check the temperature of the water entering the dishwasher. Most dishwashers require hot water that is at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit to properly clean dishes. If the water is too cold, it won't be hot enough to dissolve detergent and remove food particles. You can adjust the temperature of your hot water heater to ensure that your dishwasher is getting hot enough water.

Second, check the filters and spray arms for blockages. If these parts are clogged with food debris or hard-water deposits, they won't be able to provide adequate cleaning power. Clean any debris from the filters and spray arms and make sure they are free of obstructions.

Third, make sure that you are loading your dishwasher correctly. Dishes should not be placed too close together or stacked on top of each other as this will inhibit the spray arms from reaching them effectively. Also make sure that any items such as plastic containers or utensils are placed in the top rack away from the heating element so they don't melt or warp during a wash cycle. 

Finally, if your dishwasher is still not cleaning properly, it may be due to a buildup of detergent residue in the tub or on dishes. Try running an empty cycle with a cup of white vinegar added to help remove any detergent residue that may have accumulated over time. 

By following these steps you should be able to identify and fix most common issues causing poor dishwasher performance. If you still canâ€™t get your dishwasher working properly after trying these tips, it may be time to call in a professional for more advanced repairs and maintenance.
