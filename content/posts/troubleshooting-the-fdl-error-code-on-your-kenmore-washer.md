## Troubleshooting the FDL Error on Your Kenmore Washer
If you own a Kenmore Washer, you may have seen the "FDL" error code display on your unit's digital display. This error code can be a common occurrence, and recently many users have reported experiencing the error. Fortunately, you don't need to be an appliance expert to troubleshoot this issue. In this blog, we'll explain the FDL error code and how you can quickly and easily fix this common problem. 

When the FDL error code is displayed, it indicates that the washer is having difficulty draining the water. This code is typically triggered when the draining hose, which is responsible for carrying away all of the used water and detergent from the machine towards a drain or sink, is either clogged or not properly connected. Before you begin attempting to fix the issue, make sure that the power to the washer is turned off and the water valve is closed.

The first step in troubleshooting should be to inspect the draining hose for any kinks or blockages that could impede the water from draining properly. If the hose is kinked, you may need to call a repair technician to have it properly replaced. Then make sure that the hose is securely connected to a working drain or sink. After everything is checked and connected properly, you should turn the power back on and tests the washer to see if the FDL error is still displayed. 

In some cases, the error code may remain even after troubleshooting, so it may be necessary to call a repair technician in order to properly diagnose and solve the problem.
