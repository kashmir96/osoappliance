Sous vide is a method of cooking that uses a precise temperature-controlled water bath to cook food evenly, slowly, and precisely. It’s an incredibly versatile cooking method that can be used to make any number of delicious dishes. From juicy steaks and succulent salmon to perfect poached eggs and creamy custards, sous vide dishes are some of the most popular recipes around. Here are some of the most popular sous vide recipes that you can make at home.

Steak: One of the most popular sous vide recipes is steak. Searing it afterwards gives it an amazing caramelized crust while keeping the interior perfectly tender and juicy. To make a perfect steak every time, season your steak with salt and pepper then vacuum seal it with some butter or olive oil for added flavor. Cook in a 135-degree Fahrenheit water bath for 2 hours before searing in hot oil or butter on high heat for 1 minute per side to get an amazing steak every time!

Salmon: Another favorite sous vide recipe is salmon fillet cooked with herbs and vegetables. Start by seasoning your salmon fillet with salt, pepper, lemon juice, fresh herbs such as thyme or rosemary plus garlic cloves if desired then vacuum seal along with diced vegetables like carrot or bell pepper chunks. Cook at 132 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes then sear on high heat for 1 minute per side in hot oil or butter before serving up this delicious dish! 

Eggs: Perfectly poached eggs are possible using the sous vide technique! Simply crack eggs into individual containers (like ramekins) then fill each container halfway up with cold water before sealing them airtight with plastic wrap or aluminum foil over top to form a “bag” – this will prevent any egg whites from escaping during cooking process! Place these “bags” into preheated 135-degree Fahrenheit water bath and cook until yolks reach desired consistency – usually about 12 minutes depending on size/number of eggs being cooked at once – before serving up these delicious poached eggs! 

Custard & Panna Cotta: Last but not least is custard & panna cotta which are both popular desserts made using the sous vide technique as well! For custard start by combining heavy cream & milk together in pot over medium heat until just boiling then mix together egg yolks & sugar in separate bowl until thickened before slowly whisking hot cream/milk mixture into egg mixture; pour into individual containers (ramekins work great here too!) cover tightly with plastic wrap then place containers into preheated 140-degree Farenheit water bath; cook until set (usually about 30 minutes) before cooling down completely & storing in fridge overnight; serve topped off with fresh fruit for a delightful treat anytime! As for panna cotta simply combine heavy cream & sugar together over medium heat stirring constantly until just boiling; add gelatin sheets (or powder) stirring continuously until fully dissolved; pour mixture into individual molds/containers cover tightly then place molds/containers into preheated 140-degree Fahrenheit water bath; cook until set (about 20 minutes) cool completely overnight store chilled when ready to serve enjoy this simple yet sophisticated dessert anytime you please ! 

These are just a few of the most popular sous vide recipes that you can make at home. Sous vide cooking is incredibly versatile, so don’t be afraid to experiment with different ingredients and flavors to create your own unique dishes!
