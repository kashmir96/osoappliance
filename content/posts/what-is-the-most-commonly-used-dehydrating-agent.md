Dehydrating agents are compounds that are used to remove water or other solvents from a substance. These agents can be used in a variety of industries, such as food processing, pharmaceuticals, and chemical manufacturing. The most commonly used dehydrating agent is anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2).

Calcium chloride has two main benefits when used as a dehydrating agent. First, it is very effective at removing moisture from substances due to its hygroscopic properties. It absorbs and binds the moisture present in the substance being processed, preventing it from re-liquefying or reforming into liquid form during storage or transportation. Second, calcium chloride does not react with other substances in the same way that some other dehydrating agents do; therefore it does not produce any byproducts or unwanted reactions during the dehydration process.

Due to its effectiveness and low cost of production compared to other dehydrating agents, anhydrous calcium chloride has become one of the most widely utilized options for removing excess moisture from materials like food products and chemicals prior to packaging them for long-term storage or shipment. Additionally, it can also be added directly into certain foods such as cheese and baked goods as an ingredient in order to help maintain their desired consistency over time without compromising their taste or texture.
