## An Easy Guide to Get Rid of Ever-Growing Big Appliances 
Do you have an old, broken appliance lying around in your house that you want to get rid of but don't know where to start? Use this guide to help you quickly, safely, and smartly dispose of your appliances and help the environment in the process!

Getting rid of a big appliance can be stressful and time consuming. But, when done right, it can help you regain much-needed space and cut down on clutter. Knowing the proper way to dispose of an old appliance is essential. There are several different methods to get rid of big appliances and you should pursue options that are convenient to you and environmentally friendly. 

One way to get rid of a big appliance is to sell it. You can use sites like Craigslist, eBay, or LetGo to find someone who is willing to buy it from you. If you are able to find a buyer, you may be able to recoup some of the money you spent on the appliance.

Another way to get rid of an old appliance is to donate it. Consider donating it to an organization that works with the homeless, domestic abuse survivors, or veterans. Alternatively, donate it to a charity thrift shop that could use it. This also helps you save money on hauling costs and you’ll get a tax-deductible donation receipt.

If your appliance is too used or broken to sell or donate, you can consider recycling it. You can find local recycling centers that specialize in recycling appliances. This can help keep the appliance out of a landfill and instead, the raw materials are reused. You may even be able to get paid for recycling certain types of appliances. 

The final option is to just throw the appliance away. It’s not the most environmentally friendly choice, but for appliances that can’t be sold or donated, hauling it away is a viable option. Do some research to find local haulers and make sure to get an estimate before committing to a hauler.

Getting rid of a big appliance doesn’t have to be a painful process. Take the time to do your research and find the disposal method that works best for you. When in doubt, contact a reputable and experienced appliance repair technician.
