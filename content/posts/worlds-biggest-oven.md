The world's biggest oven is located in the city of Harbin, China. It is part of the largest food processing plant in the country and can produce up to 34 million pieces of bread per day. The oven measures a staggering 103 meters long, 10 meters wide and almost 8 meters tall. It has over 1,000 baking trays that are heated with natural gas to temperatures of around 450 degrees Celsius (850 degrees Fahrenheit). 

The oven’s enormous size means it can bake an impressive amount of bread each day – enough to feed the entire population of China’s capital Beijing! The massive machine also makes it possible for workers to produce a variety of different types of dough quickly and efficiently, such as pizza dough, croissants or even Chinese mantou buns. 

To ensure consistent results, the oven is equipped with a number of advanced technologies including infrared scanners that monitor temperature inside the chamber at all times and helps regulate heat distribution so that each tray bakes evenly. Additionally, computer-controlled mixers help maintain accurate ratios when adding ingredients like yeast or sugar into the mix before baking. 

The giant bakery uses natural gas instead of electricity because gas burns more slowly than electricity – this helps keep costs down while still providing high-quality baked goods every time. In addition to being incredibly efficient and cost-effective, this massive oven also produces significantly less smoke than traditional wood-fired baking methods which helps cut down on air pollution in Harbin city center. 

This incredible technological feat is an impressive example how modern engineering can improve production processes while helping preserve our environment at the same time!
