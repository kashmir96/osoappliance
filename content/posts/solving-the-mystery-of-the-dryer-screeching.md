## The Mystery of the Screeching Dryer Solved

Have you ever heard a loud screeching noise coming from your dryer? Is it making it hard to get a good night’s sleep? If so, you’re not alone! Many people have dealt with this frustrating issue and the key to solving it begins with understanding the cause.

The sound of a screeching dryer is often caused by an issue with the drum bearing. This is a metal bearing located at the rear of the dryer drum which allows the drum to turn smoothly and quietly. The screeching noise usually occurs when the bearing becomes dry, rusty or worn out. This is a common problem and in some cases, the bearing needs to be replaced. 

Another issue could be related to the belt that runs around the drum. If this belt is stretched, frayed, cracked or loose it will cause the drum to make a lot of noisy. Replacing the belt is typically a straightforward job but it might require some dismantling of the dryer depending on the model.

If you’ve identified that the problem is neither the drum bearing nor the belt, then it’s likely caused by something else such as the motor or the pulley. In this case, you’ll need to do some further troubleshooting to identify the issue. 

If you’re comfortable tackling the repair job yourself, there are many resources online which will help and guide you through the process step-by-step. However if you don’t have the time, patience or know-how, then it may be best to hire a professional appliance technician. 

Solving the mystery of why your dryer was screeching wasn’t so hard after all, was it? With a little patience and perseverance, you can successfully diagnose and fix the problem yourself.
