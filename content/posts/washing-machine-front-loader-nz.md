Are you considering buying a washing machine? With so many options available, it can be difficult to decide which type is best for you. One of the most popular choices in New Zealand is the front loader washing machine. In this blog, we'll explain the pros and cons of front loaders and why they're becoming more popular in New Zealand.

The biggest benefit of a front loader is that it uses much less water than top-loading models. This means lower water bills and less water wastage, making them especially attractive to eco-conscious households. Front loaders also have larger capacities than top-loaders, meaning fewer loads of washing per week. This makes them great for busy households with large families or those who do lots of laundry.

Another pro is that front loaders use less detergent and energy than top-loading models since they don't need to fill up with as much water each time. This saves money on detergent costs and helps reduce your energy bills too! Front loaders are also gentler on clothes, so if you have delicate items or special fabrics then this can be beneficial for preserving their life span. 

On the downside, some people find front loaders more difficult to use because they require bending down in order to place items inside them. They also take longer to complete a cycle than top-loading machines do – usually around an hour – so they may not be suitable for those who need quick wash cycles often. Additionally, as they use less water, there's a higher risk that dirt won't be washed away properly if clothes are left in the machine too long before being taken out – something which can be difficult to keep track of if you're busy during wash days! 

Despite these drawbacks, front loader washing machines are becoming increasingly popular in New Zealand due to their eco-friendly nature and cost savings on detergents & energy bills. Their larger capacity makes them perfect for families who need to do lots of laundry quickly and conveniently as well as those looking for an environmentally friendly option when doing their weekly wash!
