If you’re looking to upgrade your hair drying routine, then the latest type of hair dryer is worth checking out. This new type of dryer features advanced features that can help you achieve salon-quality results in the comfort of your own home.

The new type of hair dryer uses a combination of ceramic and tourmaline technology to maximize its drying power. The ceramic material helps to evenly distribute heat, while the tourmaline emits negative ions which help to lock in moisture and reduce frizz. This combination helps to provide a gentle, yet effective drying process that reduces damage from over-drying and locks in natural oils for healthy looking hair.

The new type of hair dryer also offers adjustable temperature settings so you can customize your drying experience based on your needs and preferences. This feature allows you to set the heat lower for fragile or color treated hair, or higher for thicker or more coarse textures. Along with this adjustable temperature setting is an ionic switch which helps maintain healthy shine and reduce static electricity in your newly styled ‘do.

Finally, the new type of hair dryer is much quieter than other models available on the market today - making it easier on your ears as well as less disruptive if you’re trying to style during nap time! Additionally, this model has a lightweight design making it easy to transport if you’re always on-the-go. 

All in all, this new type of hair dryer is definitely worth considering if you’re looking for an upgrade from your current model!
