Air conditioning is a common technology used to control the temperature and humidity of indoor spaces. It works by circulating air through refrigerant-filled coils to cool or heat it, depending on the desired temperature. Air conditioning systems can also filter out pollutants, making them an important part of any home or business’s indoor air quality system.

The basics of air conditioning start with understanding how your system works. There are two main components in an air conditioning unit: the compressor and condenser coils. The compressor pumps a refrigerant gas through the condenser coils, which absorb heat from the surrounding air as it passes over them. This process lowers the temperature of the air inside your home or business, creating a comfortable environment for you to enjoy.

In addition to cooling your space, modern air conditioners are also capable of removing moisture from the air using dehumidifiers and humidifiers. Dehumidifiers reduce humidity levels by removing excess moisture from the air while humidifiers increase humidity levels by adding moisture back into it. This helps maintain comfortable temperatures while keeping mold and mildew at bay in high-humidity climates. 

Finally, most modern units include filtration systems that can help remove dust particles and other pollutants from your indoor environment for improved health and comfort indoors. 

These are just some of the basics when it comes to understanding how an air conditioning system works—but if you’re looking for more detailed information about what makes up an AC unit or how to choose one for your space, consult with a professional HVAC technician today!
