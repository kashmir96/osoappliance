Miele dishwashers are some of the most reliable and efficient models on the market, which is why many people choose them. But to get the most out of your Miele dishwasher, it’s important to consider investing in some accessories. Here are five must-have accessories for your Miele dishwasher:

1. Cutlery Tray: A cutlery tray is essential for getting your knives and forks properly cleaned and organized. It prevents items from moving around during the wash cycle, ensuring that everything comes out sparkling clean.

2. Water Softener: If you live in an area with hard water, a water softener can be a lifesaver when it comes to keeping your dishes looking their best. The softener works by removing minerals from the water so that they don’t leave behind spots or streaks on dishes as they dry.

3. Rinse Aid Dispenser: A rinse aid dispenser helps ensure that dishes come out spot-free after each cycle by creating a thin film over them that repels water droplets during drying time. This helps reduce streaking and spotting on glasses and other delicate items while also making them easier to wipe off afterwards.

4. Detergent Dispenser: While you may not think it’s necessary, a detergent dispenser can make all the difference when it comes to getting dishes sparkling clean every time you run a cycle. It ensures that just the right amount of detergent is used for each load so you don’t waste any or end up with too much suds left behind after washing is done! 
 
5 Dish Racks: Finally, if you need extra space for large pots or pans or want more flexibility in how items are placed inside your machine, then consider investing in some additional dish racks to customize your Miele dishwasher even more! These can also be helpful if you have different types of dishes that need special attention during washing cycles (like stemware). 

These five accessories will help make sure that your Miele dishwasher runs smoothly and efficiently every time you use it – leaving all of your dishes spotless and sparkling!
