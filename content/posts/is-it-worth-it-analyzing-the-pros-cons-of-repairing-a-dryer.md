## Analyzing the Value of Repairing a Dryer

Are you wondering if a broken dryer is worth repairing? Before determining whether to repair or purchase a new one, it is important for homeowners to understand the pros and cons of each option. Here, we will explore the costs associated with both and weigh-in on the most advantageous option for you. 

The primary advantage of repairing a dryer as opposed to buying a new one is that it is generally cheaper to repair a dryer than to purchase a new one outright. Depending on the repair, it looks can be significantly less expensive than buying a new machine. An individual should also contemplate the age of the dryer, because relatively new models might be more efficient, rather than the models made decades ago.

Repairs can be expensive and the costs of repairing a dryer may surpass the cost of a newer model. If a dryer is between seven and ten years old, it might be robust enough that the appliance parts need to be replaced more frequently. This is when it may be more cost-effective to purchase a newer dryer.

Another factor to consider when deciding whether to repair a dryer or to purchase a new one is the cooling energy efficiency of a newer model. Many newer models may save on energy costs, comparatively. Newer models can also reduce danger in households.

When it comes down to it, homeowners should look into the factors weighed and make a decision best for them. If a dryer is older, a homeowner should consider finding a newer model and possibly save on energy costs and potentially dangerous complications. If a dryer is relatively new and is not commonly used, an individual may find that the cost of parts to repair a broken dryer is far less than buying a brand new one. 

No matter the decision made, homeowners should take a look at our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to further be informed with their repairs and to diagnose the problem. Make sure to look at both options before choosing the one that is right for you.
