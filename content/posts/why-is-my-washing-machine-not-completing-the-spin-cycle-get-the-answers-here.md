## Why is My Washing Machine Not Finishing the Spin Cycle?

Has your washing machine stopped spinning before completing a cycle? This can be annoying, but it's usually nothing to worry about as there are a few simple steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue. Before you call a repairman, take a quick look at this guide to help you identify the source of the issue and possible solutions. 

One of the most common causes is that the load is unbalanced. This can occur when all of the clothes are not distributed evenly across the drum. When the washing machine is unbalanced it will stop spinning. You can check to make sure that the drum is evenly balanced by stopping the machine and rearranging the clothes, and then restarting the spin cycle. 

Another potential cause is that the machine needs to be reset. This can happen if the machine isn't responding as normal or has been erroring out. To reset your washing machine, first turn it off and unplug or switch it off at the wall. Wait for 30 minutes before turning it back on and restarting the spin cycle. This process should reset the machine and get your machine running smoothly again. 

Finally, the issue may be related to a faulty part. If any of the other solutions don't fix the spinning problem, it's likely that one of the internal components has gone faulty. The exact problem may vary depending on the make and model, but generally speaking it's likely to be a poor connection or a damaged motor. If you are confident to investigate yourself, make sure you consult our comprehensive [appliance error codes glossary](./error-codes/). This will help you to identify which component has failed and what action you will need to take. 

Ultimately, if all else has failed, it's best to contact an appliance technician to inspect your machine. This way you can be sure that the problem is properly identified and fixed.

In conclusion, if your washing machine is not completing the spin cycle, it is likely that the problem is caused by an unbalancing or resetting issue or a faulty component. Make sure you try the steps outlined in this guide, or find a professional help you identify and repair the issue to get your washing machine spinning again.
