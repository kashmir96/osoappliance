If your dishwasher is emitting an unpleasant odor, it’s likely due to a buildup of bacteria, mold, and mildew. This is usually caused by food particles and grease that have been left behind in the dishwasher after washing dishes. The smell can also be caused by standing water in the bottom of the dishwasher or a clogged drain filter. Fortunately, there are some easy steps you can take to eliminate bad odors from your dishwasher. 

The first step is to clean out all of the food particles and grease that have built up in the dishwasher over time. You can do this by running an empty cycle with a cup of white vinegar in it. The vinegar will help break down any food particles and grease that are stuck on the walls and bottom of the dishwasher. After running an empty cycle with vinegar, use a scrub brush to remove any remaining debris from the walls and bottom of the dishwasher. 

Next, it’s important to regularly clean the drain filter to prevent any buildup from occurring. The drain filter should be checked every few months for any food particles or debris that has accumulated in it. If you find any buildup, use a scrub brush to remove it before running another cycle with vinegar. 

Finally, make sure to leave the door open after each cycle so that air can circulate inside the dishwasher and help dry out any remaining moisture from previous cycles. This will help prevent mold and mildew from forming in your dishwasher which can lead to bad odors over time. 

By following these simple steps, you should be able to get rid of any bad odors coming from your dishwasher and keep it smelling fresh for longer periods of time.
