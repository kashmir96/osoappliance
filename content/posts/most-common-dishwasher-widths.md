When it comes to buying a dishwasher, one of the most important factors to consider is the width. Dishwasher widths come in different sizes, so you want to make sure you pick the right size for your kitchen and for the dishes you’ll be washing. 

Standard-sized dishwashers are 24 inches wide, which can fit up to 12 place settings. This is a popular size because it can easily integrate into most kitchen layouts and accommodate most dinnerware sets. If you have an average-sized family or entertain occasionally, this size should suit your needs perfectly. 

Compact or slimline dishwashers usually measure 18 inches wide and can fit up to six place settings. These smaller units are perfect for couples who don’t need a full-size model or those with limited counter space in their kitchens. 

If you have a larger family or entertain often, then you may want to opt for a larger model that measures 36 inches wide and can hold up to 16 place settings. While these models tend to be more expensive than standard-sized dishwashers, they are worth the investment if they provide enough capacity for all your dishes without taking up too much space in your kitchen. 

Finally, there are also extra-wide models that measure 48 inches across and can hold up to 20 place settings – ideal if you have an especially large family or frequently host dinner parties at home! These units tend to be quite expensive but will save time when it comes time for cleanup after big meals since they can clean more dishes at once than standard sizes can handle in one cycle. 

No matter which width of dishwasher best fits your lifestyle and kitchen space, having one will make cleaning dishes easier than ever before!
