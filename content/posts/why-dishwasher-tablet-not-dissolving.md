If you’ve ever been frustrated by a dishwasher tablet that won’t dissolve, you’re not alone. This can be a common problem and it can be difficult to figure out why the tablet isn’t dissolving.

The most common reason for a dishwasher tablet not dissolving is that it has been placed in the wrong part of the dishwasher. Most tablets need to go in the dispenser cup, which is typically located on the inside of the door. If the tablet is placed anywhere else in the dishwasher, it won’t get enough water and heat to dissolve properly.

Another possible cause is that there isn’t enough water in the dishwasher for the tablet to dissolve. If this is the case, try running a cycle with just water before adding your dishwashing tablet. This should help ensure that there is enough water for it to dissolve properly.

It could also be that your dishwasher is too full or that you are using too much detergent. If your dishes are overcrowded, they can block the flow of water and prevent proper cleaning and dissolution of detergent tablets. Similarly, if you are using too much detergent, it can create excess suds which can also interfere with dissolution. To fix this issue, make sure to spread out your dishes so they aren’t blocking each other and use only the recommended amount of detergent as stated on your product instructions.

Finally, if none of these solutions work, you may need to check if there is something blocking or clogging up your dishwasher filter or spray arm. This could prevent proper circulation of water and prevent dissolution of your tablet. Clean any debris from these parts and try running another cycle with a new tablet to see if this fixes the problem. 

If all else fails, contact a professional repairman who should be able to diagnose and fix any underlying problems with your machine that might be preventing proper dissolution of tablets.
