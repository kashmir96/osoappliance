## Fixing an F50 Error Code on a Frigidaire Range 
Have you ever encountered an F50 Error Code while trying to use your Frigidaire Range? Not to worry, with a few simple steps you can easily diagnose and address the issue. 

In order to begin troubleshooting, first check and make sure that the oven’s control board is functioning properly. This can be done by attempting to reset the control board by unplugging the oven for up to five minutes. After the oven is plugged back in, try preheating it again to see if the F50 error code still occurs. 

If the error code continues, a more in depth troubleshooting may be necessary. Parts that should be inspected include the oven temperature sensor and its wiring, the oven relay board, and the oven control board. These components can be tested using a multimeter by measuring voltage, resistance, and/or continuity. 

In certain cases, the F50 error code may indicate a faulty, worn out, or corroded bake element. If this is the case, this component will need to be replaced in order to completely fix the problem. 

It is important to always stay safe while working with appliances. Unplug the oven before performing any type of troubleshooting procedure. To ensure that your Frigidaire Range is fixed correctly and in a safe manner, consider contacting a local appliance repair technician.
