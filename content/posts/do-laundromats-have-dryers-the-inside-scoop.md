The dryer options you’ll find at most laundromats vary from location to location. Some may only offer basic stackable electric dryers while others may offer more sophisticated units with electronic controls and advanced features such as steam or sanitize cycles. Some laundromats even offer gas-powered dryers. Gas dryers are usually more powerful than their electric counterparts and will usually take less time to get your laundry items completely dry. 

When it comes to pricing, most laundromat owners base their fees on the size of the load you’re drying rather than the type of machine being used.
