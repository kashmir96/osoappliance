## Troubleshooting Your Bosch Oven When Receive E011
Using a household appliance should not be a stressful situation, but sadly when a malfunction occurs, it can be. Such is the case when the Bosch oven displays the E011 error code, leaving oven owners frustrated in the kitchen. Fortunately, this code can be simple and easy to fix.

First, let's understand exactly what the error code E011 means. This code indicates that the oven's door is likely not aligned correctly, which can be more easily seen if all the lights illuminating the buttons on the oven door are all illuminated. The solution to this is to ensure that the door is properly calibrated by following these steps:

1. Begin by unplugging the power cable and ensure that the oven has cooled down.
2. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to loosen and remove the two screws that are located in the hinges and slide the oven door out.
3. Locate the top left hinge and the top right hinge and verify that the hinge supports are screwed onto the metal brackets where the screws were originally placed. This is done to make sure that the door is properly aligned with the ovenâ€™s seal.
4. Now, push the oven door back in, making sure that the hinges are lined up with the metal brackets, and then tighten the screws back in.
5. Test the door to make sure it opens and closes properly, and that the seal is tight. If all is good, plug the power cable back in and turn the oven back on.

By following the easy steps above, this should eliminate the E011 error code displayed on Bosch ovens. If for any reason, the error code comes back, please reach out to a qualified repair technician. Additionally, it's always a good idea to stay up to date on the maintenance of your oven to minimize the chances of running into other issues.
