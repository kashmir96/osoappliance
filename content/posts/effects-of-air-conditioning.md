Air conditioning has become an essential component of modern life. It provides the necessary cooling for our homes, offices and vehicles, and we often take it for granted. But air conditioning can also have some negative effects on our health and environment.

One of the most significant effects of air conditioning is on our respiratory system. Air conditioners tend to reduce the humidity levels in a room, which can cause dry skin, sore throats, coughing and asthma attacks. Furthermore, these devices often recirculate old air in an enclosed space, potentially circulating dust particles that can exacerbate allergies or asthma symptoms. 

Another major effect of air conditioning is its impact on the environment. Air conditioners emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which contribute to global warming and climate change. These emissions are not only damaging to our planet's atmosphere but also have serious health risks associated with them such as increased heat-related illnesses and deaths due to extreme weather events caused by climate change. 

In addition to environmental impact from air conditioning usage, there are also economic impacts associated with its use. Air conditioning systems require a lot of energy to operate which leads to higher electricity bills for consumers and businesses alike; this is especially true during summer months when these systems are running all day long trying desperately to keep up with rising temperatures outside! 

Finally, air conditioners can be noisy at times due to their internal fans or compressors that produce loud humming noises or other such disruptions; this can be annoying both inside and outside your home or office! 

Overall, although there are many benefits associated with using an air conditioner such as keeping us cool in hot weather conditions or reducing humidity levels indoors – it comes at a cost of various negative consequences both economically as well as ecologically/environmentally speaking! Therefore it’s important that we use these systems responsibly by ensuring they’re properly serviced/maintained regularly and only used when absolutely necessary so as not to waste any more energy than what’s needed!
