## The Unexpected Origins of the Microwave Oven

It's hard to imagine a kitchen without a microwave oven. This life-saving appliance simplifies meal preparation and allows us to produce tasty hot meals with the push of a button. However, the microwave oven has an unexpected and fascinating history that dates back to the 1940's. 

In 1945, American engineer Percy Spencer was working with a type of magnetron tube at a company called Raytheon. As he stood in front of the equipment, he noticed that a chocolate bar in his pocket had melted. This sparked an idea about a different type of radar cooking, which made use of microwaves instead of traditional methods of heat. Spencer then conducted further experiments and found that microwave radiation could heat food quickly and uniformly.

Raytheon then filed and was granted a patent in 1947 and released the first microwave oven named the Radarange in 1954. The Radarange was the size of a refrigerator, weighed almost 800lbs, cost £5,000, and required a water-cooling system. Raytheon then released a home model in 1967, called the Amana Radarange, weighing nearly 200lbs and priced at around £475. This oven was much more affordable, but still required an external vent system.

Today, microwave ovens come in a variety of sizes and prices, ranging from countertop units to built-in units. Despite the convenience and popularity of microwaves, one should keep in mind that not all food items are suitable for microwave ovens. If you're seeking to upgrade your kitchen appliances, be sure to do your research to make an informed decision. 

The microwave oven has come a long way since the days of the Radarange and it has become an integral part of many households due to its speed, convenience, and ease of use.
