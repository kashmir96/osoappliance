If you’ve ever wanted to make a big batch of smoothies, shakes or other blended drinks, then you’ll be impressed with the world record for the biggest blender appliance. The record-breaking blender is called the Megablend and it was created by Magic Bullet in 2015. This impressive appliance has a 3 1/2 gallon capacity which is enough to blend up to 36 servings at once! 

The Megablend isn’t just big, it also has plenty of power and features. It comes equipped with a powerful 1,400-watt motor that can handle tough blending tasks like crushing ice and nuts into powdery consistency for smoothies or protein shakes. It also features several speed settings and pulse options so you can choose the perfect speed for your concoction. Plus, it has an extra large lid so you can easily add ingredients as needed without having to remove the entire lid.

Aside from its size and power, one of the most impressive features of this blender is its safety features. The Megablend comes with an emergency shut off switch that will automatically shut off if anything goes wrong during use – such as overheating or overloading – so you don’t have to worry about any accidents while blending your favorite drinks or recipes. 

For those looking for convenience in their kitchen appliances, this giant blender also offers something special - an adjustable stand that allows you to position it at any angle or height depending on your needs while using it. This means no more bending over when trying to reach a difficult spot in your drink preparation! 

If you want a professional quality blender that will help take your drinks up a notch but don't have room in your kitchen for multiple appliances - then look no further than the world record breaking Megablend from Magic Bullet!
