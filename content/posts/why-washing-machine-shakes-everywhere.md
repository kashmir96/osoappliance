Are you fed up with your washing machine shaking like crazy during the spin cycle? It’s a common problem, but not one that you should ignore. A shaking washing machine can be caused by several factors, and can potentially cause serious damage to your appliance. In this blog post we will discuss what could be causing your washing machine to shake and how to identify the problem before contacting an appliance repair serviceman from our directory. 

The first thing to do if you notice your washing machine is shaking or vibrating excessively is to check if it’s level on the floor. If not, adjust the feet until it’s perfectly level. This will help ensure that all parts inside the washer are working properly and evenly distributed in weight when spinning. You should also make sure that there is nothing obstructing the base or near its sides as this could lead to excess vibration during operation. 

If these steps don’t fix the issue then there may be an issue with one of its internal components such as a worn out belt, drum bearing or motor mount which has become loose over time due to wear and tear. Another possible cause of excessive vibration is when objects get trapped between two items of clothing in the load which causes imbalances in weight distribution during spin cycles leading to vibrations being transmitted throughout your washer's structure. To prevent this from happening regularly make sure all zippers, buttons and other items are secured before adding them into each load you wash so they don't get stuck together during a spin cycle. 

Lastly, it could just be simply down too much laundry in each load - try reducing the amount of clothes per wash so that there's enough room for water circulation which will help prevent excessive vibrations from occurring inside your washer's drum as well as potentially saving energy costs! 

If any of these solutions don't work then contact an experienced appliance repair serviceman from our directory who can identify and fix any underlying issues associated with why your washing machine shakes excessively when spinning!
