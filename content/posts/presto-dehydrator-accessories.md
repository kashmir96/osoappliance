Dehydrators are a great way to preserve food and make flavorful snacks. With a Presto dehydrator, you can make jerky, dried fruits and vegetables, and many other types of delicious snacks. But in order to get the most out of your dehydrator, you need to make sure you have the right accessories.

First off, you’ll need some trays to put your food on. Most Presto dehydrators come with five or six trays, but if you need more to fit all of your ingredients in one batch then extra trays are available. If you plan on dehydrating large items like whole fruits or vegetables, then a mesh sheet is also a great addition. Mesh sheets help ensure that smaller pieces don’t fall through the cracks of the trays during dehydration.

Next, it’s important to make sure that your dehydrator is properly ventilated so that air can circulate around your food properly. Many Presto models come with an adjustable fan speed control so you can tailor the airflow appropriately for different types of snacks. For even better circulation and faster drying times, consider adding an AC adapter and fan booster for an even more efficient dehydration process.

Finally, if you plan on using your Presto dehydrator frequently then it’s worth investing in some cleaning supplies such as brush cleaners and sanitizing wipes to keep everything clean and bacteria-free after each use. With these accessories at hand, your Presto dehydrator will be ready for any type of snack!
