Kettle chips have been around since the 1980s, and they’ve become one of the most popular snack foods in the world. Kettle chips are made using a unique cooking technique, which gives them their signature flavor and crunchy texture. The process involves a slow-cooking in hot oil to achieve an even crispness throughout each chip. Kettle chips come in a variety of flavors and styles, ranging from classic salt & vinegar to more adventurous concoctions like jalapeno and lime.

One of the main reasons for their popularity is that kettle chips are usually cooked with less oil than regular potato chips, making them lower in fat. This makes them an ideal snack for people looking for something tasty but still relatively healthy. Kettle-style chips also tend to be thicker than regular potato chips, making them more filling as well as providing extra crunchiness with every bite!

Kettle Chips come in many varieties and flavors depending on where you buy them from. Popular brands like Lay’s, Pringles, Old Dutch, Utz, Cape Cod Potato Chips all make kettle-style potato chips; however there are hundreds of smaller brands that specialize solely in kettle chip production too! Some popular flavors include barbeque (BBQ), sour cream & onion (SC&O), sea salt & cracked pepper (SS&CP), honey mustard (HM), cheddar cheese (CC) and jalapeno lime (JL). 

No matter what your taste preferences are there is likely a flavor of Kettle Chip that will satisfy your craving! Enjoy their crunchy texture and flavorful taste today!
