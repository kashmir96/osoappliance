Air conditioning cleaner spray is a great way to keep your air conditioner running at peak efficiency. It helps keep the system free of dirt and dust, which can clog the coils and lead to decreased airflow and higher energy costs. The spray also helps reduce allergens like pollen, pet dander, and mold spores in the air.

Using an air conditioning cleaner spray is easy. First, turn off the power to your unit at the breaker box. Then open up the access panel on your unit and locate the evaporator coil. Spray a generous amount of cleaner over the coil until it’s completely coated. Let it sit for 15 minutes so that it can break down any dirt or debris that has built up over time. Finally, use a soft cloth to wipe away any excess residue before closing up your access panel again.

Regular use of an air conditioning cleaner spray can help keep your AC system running efficiently by reducing energy costs and improving indoor air quality. It’s important to follow manufacturer instructions when using a spray as some may require special safety precautions or additional steps in order to be effective. Additionally, if you have questions about how often you should use an AC cleaner spray or how best to apply it, contact an expert HVAC technician for advice on maintenance schedules specific to your system’s needs!
