## Trouble-Shooting Your Problem Heat Pump 

If you're having trouble with your heat pump, don't worry. With a few simple tips, you can diagnose and resolve your issue. By following these tips, you can rest assured that, with a bit of knowledge and effort, you can solve your heat pump problem in no time.

### Inspect for Electrical Problems 

If the heat pump is not starting or if it does not appear to be getting power, you need to inspect for an electrical problem. Begin by checking the thermostat to verify power, then check the fuse box and ensure that the proper fuse is set for the system. If all is good up to this point and the heat pump still does not appear to be getting power, conduct further inspections to see if a switch, timer or limit control attached to the system is broken. If the issue is a broken or malfunctioning component, you'll need to replace the part or call a qualified repairman.

### Check Refrigerant Levels 

If the heat pump is not producing any or sufficient heat, you may have an issue with your system's refrigerant levels. Inspect the unit and look for any leaking or sweating on the wall that can indicate a refrigerant leak. If you find a leak, an experienced repair technician will need to come and assess the situation. If you find no leaking, this does not necessarily mean that you have the correct amount of refrigerant in your system. You may need to bring in a certified HVAC technician to take a closer look. 

### Look for Obstructions 

Another issue that could be causing your heat pump to malfunction is an obstruction in the vents. Make sure to clear any shrubs, fences, and other barriers that might be blocking the airflow. In addition, check to see if the outside unit is covered in any debris or dirt. Clear out any dirt that's blocking vents and give your air conditioning unit room to breathe. 

### Contact an Experienced Technician

In some cases, it might be best to contact a qualified repair professional. An experienced HVAC technician can not only replace or repair broken parts or adjust refrigerant levels, they can also offer experienced tips and advice to keep your system running at its best.
