Stove lighters are an essential tool for lighting gas stoves, but if your stove lighter is continuously clicking, it can be frustrating. The clicking sound usually indicates that there is an issue with the gas flow or the spark.

When a stove lighter is clicked, it releases a small spark of electricity which ignites the gas from the stove. If the spark is weak or the gas flow is blocked, the spark will not be able to ignite the gas, causing the stove lighter to keep clicking. 

The most common cause of a stove lighter clicking is a blocked gas line. This is usually caused by dirt or debris that has built up in the line, preventing the gas flow from reaching the spark. To fix this issue, the gas line must be cleaned out.

Another common cause of stove lighters clicking is a worn spark module. The spark module is the part of the stove lighter which produces the spark. If this part is worn out, the spark will not be strong enough to ignite the gas. In this case, the spark module must be replaced.

Finally, if the stove lighter is clicking but the gas line and spark module are both in good condition, the issue may be caused by a faulty igniter switch. This switch is responsible for sending the spark to the gas line, and if it is not working correctly, the spark will not be sent. To fix this issue, the igniter switch must be replaced.

In conclusion, a stove lighter that keeps clicking is usually caused by a blocked gas line, a worn spark module, or a faulty igniter switch. To fix the issue, the cause of the clicking must be identified and the appropriate repair made.
