## Identifying and Resolving Microwave Issues

For many households, their microwave is one of the key kitchen appliances and an often-used device. The ability to quickly and easily heat up or defrost food is a great convenience. As with any appliance, though, microwaves can develop faults from frequent use or from aging. Knowing how to identify, diagnose and repair common faults can help you fix the issue or identify when you should call a professional. 

One of the most common faults associated with microwaves is door failures. If your microwaveâ€™s door no longer seals properly, it could result in microwave radiation leaking out if not addressed. To diagnose the cause of the issue, you may have to take the door off and examine the internal springs, catches and latches which will hold the door shut when closed. If these appear to be worn or bent, you will likely need a specialist technician to come in to repair the tracking or replace the actual parts.

Another common fault is the magnetron, or the motor which creates microwaves. These will commonly malfunction due to usage or from bad wiring, overloading the motor and causing it to become overheated or burn out. If you smell burning or notice sparking from the device, you will likely need to call a professional for further diagnosis and repair.

The third common fault is related to your electrical power. If you have a tripped breaker or if your plug is not correctly powered, you may have an intermittent power which would intermittently turn the microwave off and on. To diagnose this, check your main supply and ensure the wires appear to be connected correctly. You may even try unplugging your microwave and re-plugging it in, or using a different circuit. If the fault remains, contact a professional for further assistance. 

By knowing how to identify common faults and diagnose the cause of the issue, you can easily determine when it is time to repair your microwave or simply replace it.
