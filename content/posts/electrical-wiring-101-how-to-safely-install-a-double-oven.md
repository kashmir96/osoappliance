## Learn the Steps for Installing a Double Oven with Electrical Wiring
Installing a double oven in your kitchen is a great way to save time and accomplish more intricate cooking tasks, but it has its own set of considerations for electrical wiring installation. With the proper planning and safety tips, you can successfully and safely install a double oven in your kitchen without any fuss!

After you’ve safely disconnected the power to the area you’ll be working in, it’s time to prepare the wiring. While the building has a main power line, it rarely runs to the exact area you need to wire your double oven. This means you’ll need to install a separate wiring scheme from the existing main power line to your new unit. Choose a circuit cable that is compatible with your oven’s maximum wattage limit and check for length and thickness for the best connection. Make sure the cable meets the rating of the appliance and its corresponding breaker.

Connect the double oven to the power source using the circuit cable. When testing the connection, use a multimeter to ensure it’s running current correctly while also acknowledging any voltage drop. Mount your double oven to the wall and ensure it’s securely fastened to the surface. Aluminum and metal plates can help provide a secure connection to the wall. Lastly, caulk the oven and wall interface to help protect the area from moisture.

By following these steps, you can easily and safely install a double oven in your kitchen. Start by making sure the wall is strong enough and the appliance is firmly attached to the wall with the necessary anchors and reinforcements. Then, be sure to plan for your power setup and double check the wattage limit of your double oven to ensure it fits within the existing power source. With the proper planning and safety tips, you’ll be able to safely install a double oven and get to cooking.
