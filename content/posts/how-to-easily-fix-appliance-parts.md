## An Introduction to Easy Appliance Part Repairs

Often times, when our appliances go on the fritz, it’s easy to think that the only solution is to call a repair technician. But some appliances can be repaired with a little bit of know-how and determination. Knowing how to replace and fix appliance parts is a great way to save money and become more self-sufficient!

The first step to becoming an appliance repair technician is to get familiar with the appliance you’re trying to repair. Read through your appliance’s owner’s manual and get familiar with the layout and parts of your appliance. Knowing the parts and where each component is located will be hugely beneficial if you decide to try and repair the appliance by yourself.

Once you know the parts and layout of your appliance, it’s time to order the part(s) you will need to fix it. You can purchase parts online or at a retail store dedicated to appliance parts. Many of these stores offer discounts if you purchase multiple parts at once, so it’s important to get familiar with what parts you need in order to get the best deal. 

After you have the part(s) you need, you will need a few tools to get started. A screwdriver, wrench, and pliers are the usual suspects. Depending on the type of repair, you may need other tools. Once again, reading through the appliance owner’s manual may provide insight into what type of tools you’ll need.

Now that you’re armed with the necessary tools and parts, it’s time to get to work! Disconnect the appliance from its power source, then get to work replacing the part(s). The instructions for doing this may be located in the owner’s manual, but if you’re still feeling unsure, then there are lots of great online tutorials and videos available. 

Once the part is replaced and the appliance is reassembled, it’s time to fire it up again. With any luck, the appliance will be back up and running!

With a little bit of effort and knowledge, you can fix and replace appliance parts with ease. This can save you significantly in terms of repair costs, and help you become more self-sufficient. But if you ever get in over your head and feel like you need assistance, our [directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) is here to help.
