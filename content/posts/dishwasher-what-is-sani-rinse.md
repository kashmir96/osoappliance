A Sani Rinse is a feature that can be found on many dishwashers. It is a cycle that uses hot water to sanitize dishes and other kitchen items, making them safe to use. The Sani Rinse cycle typically uses higher temperatures than the regular wash cycle, and it also adds an extra rinse at the end of the cycle. This additional rinse helps to ensure that all of the soap and food particles are thoroughly removed from dishes and other items.

The Sani Rinse cycle is especially useful for households with small children or people with weakened immune systems, as it helps to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses. It is also recommended for households that have pets, as pet saliva can contain bacteria that can cause illness in humans. The Sani Rinse cycle can also help to reduce the spread of germs from one person to another in a household setting.

If you have a dishwasher with a Sani Rinse feature, you should use it when washing items like baby bottles, pacifiers, pet bowls, cutting boards and utensils used for preparing raw meats or poultry. It should also be used after someone in the household has been sick, as this will help to reduce the spread of germs. 

It is important to note that while the Sani Rinse cycle can help reduce bacteria on your dishes, it does not guarantee full sterilization. To ensure your dishes are fully disinfected, you should use a dishwasher-safe sanitizer between cycles or hand-wash your dishes with hot water and soap.
