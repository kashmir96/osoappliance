# Best cycle mode to use a washing machine on a daily basis

If you’re looking for the best cycle mode to use on a washing machine on a daily basis, it really depends on what type of laundry you’re doing. Generally speaking, the best cycle mode to use is the Normal cycle. This cycle is designed to handle everyday loads of laundry and is usually the most energy-efficient option. It also offers a good balance between cleaning performance and gentleness on fabrics. 

However, if you’re washing heavily soiled items like jeans or towels, you may want to opt for a Heavy Duty cycle. This setting will provide more agitation and longer wash times in order to get deep into fabric fibers and remove stubborn dirt and stains. 

For delicate items like lingerie or silk blouses, you should use the Delicate or Hand Wash cycle. This setting reduces agitation and uses cold water temperatures to help protect delicate fabrics from damage during the wash process. 

Finally, if you’re washing items that require special care such as wool sweaters or cashmere garments, it’s best to use a Wool/Cashmere cycle. This setting uses gentle agitation and low spin speeds in order to prevent shrinkage or damage caused by harsh agitation or high spin speeds. 

No matter what type of laundry you’re doing, always be sure to check your washing machine manual for specific instructions on how to select the best cycle mode for your particular load of laundry.
