Cleaning your washing machine is an important part of keeping your laundry clean and fresh. It might seem like a daunting task at first, but with just a few easy steps, you can keep your washer running smoothly and odor-free.

The first step in cleaning your washing machine is to run an empty cycle using hot water. This will help remove any dirt and debris that may have accumulated over time. Add two cups of white vinegar to the empty cycle to help break down any residue that may be clinging to the inside of the machine. The vinegar will also help remove odors from the washer. Once this cycle has completed, you can either leave it empty or add a half cup of baking soda to the next cycle for additional cleaning power.

After completing one or two cycles with hot water and vinegar or baking soda, it’s time to tackle the rubber seal around the door of your washing machine. This seal traps dirt and moisture which can lead to musty odors if not cleaned regularly. To clean this seal, dampen a cloth with warm soapy water and gently scrub all around the perimeter of the door seal until it is free from any built-up grime or dirt particles. If there are any hard-to-remove stains on this area, try using a soft bristled brush dipped in white vinegar solution before wiping away with a damp cloth again. 

Finally, once you’ve finished cleaning all other areas inside and outside of your washing machine, fill it up halfway with warm soapy water once more and run another full cycle on its highest setting without adding clothes or detergent into it - this will help flush out any remaining bacteria that may be lingering in your washer after cleaning it out thoroughly! 

Cleaning your washing machine regularly is key for keeping unpleasant smells at bay as well as helping extend its lifespan by preventing potential breakdowns due to built up grime or debris over time - so make sure you don't neglect this chore when doing laundry!
