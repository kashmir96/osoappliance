No stovetop does not necessarily mean no oven. While a stovetop is typically used to cook food on the stove, an oven is used to bake or roast food.

An oven is a separate appliance from a stovetop, and it can be used without a stovetop. Ovens are typically powered by electricity or gas, and they use dry heat to cook food. This dry heat can be used to bake cakes, cookies, breads, and other baked goods. It can also be used to roast meats and vegetables.

It's important to note that some ovens do not have a stovetop. For example, wall ovens are typically installed beneath a countertop, and they do not have a stovetop. However, these ovens can still be used to bake and roast food.

In addition to wall ovens, there are also smaller ovens, such as toaster ovens and countertop convection ovens. These ovens are typically powered by electricity, and they can be used to bake and roast food.

So, while a stovetop is typically used to cook food on the stove, an oven is a separate appliance that can be used to bake and roast food. Some ovens do not have a stovetop, but they can still be used to cook food.
