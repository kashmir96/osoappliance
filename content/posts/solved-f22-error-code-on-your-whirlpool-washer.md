Have you ever seen an F22 error code on your Whirlpool washer? Do you know what it means and how to troubleshoot it? This blog will help you understand the meaning of the F22 error code and provide you with steps to resolve it.

The F22 error code on your Whirlpool washer indicates that it is sensing a long drain time. This usually happens when there is an obstruction in the pump, or when the drain hose is kinked, clogged, or incorrect.

To troubleshoot the F22 error code:
1. Inspect the drain hose for any kinks or damage. Make sure it is securely attached to the drain and the back of the washer.
2. Check the inlet hose too, to make sure there is no kink or blockage.
3. If the drain and water hoses are free of kinks and damage, reset the washer. To reset it, press the Start/Pause button for five seconds.
4. If the error persists, contact a technician to inspect the washer for further damage.

Before calling a technician, make sure the areas around the washing machine are clear from any obstructions. This will help them work faster and resolve the issue quicker.

The F22 error code on your Whirlpool washer can be resolved by carefully inspecting the drain and water hoses for any kinks or obstructions.
