## Maximizing the Lifespan of Your Dryer
When was the last time you thought about replacing your dryer? For most people, the answer is probably “never.” Unfortunately, dryers don’t last forever. Knowing the average lifespan of a dryer can help you plan ahead and ensure your household appliance is always in peak condition. 

The typical dryer can last anywhere from 8 to 14 years, depending on a variety of factors. The type of dryer you buy, the amount of use it gets, and how well you maintain it are all important considerations. Front-loading models tend to last longer than top-loaders, and frequent repairs can significantly reduce the life of your dryer. You should still expect to replace your dryer periodically, but careful maintenance can help you get the most out of it. 

To keep your dryer running well for as long as possible, you should inspect it for damage periodically and make necessary repairs promptly. Be especially mindful of venting. Ensure the vent pipe is securely attached and check regularly for obstructions like lint or dust. You should also periodically check your dryer’s seal and belts for wear and tear. Simple preventive measures can help you identify and resolve any issues early. 

It’s also important to use your dryer correctly. Every time you dry your clothes, you should clean out the lint trap, use the proper setting for the load size, and give larger items more space to circulate. Overloading your dryer or using the wrong settings can cause it to run hot and increase the risk of an appliance fire. That is why it is so important to follow the manufacturer’s directions when operating your dryer. 

As with any major appliance, knowing the average lifespan of a dryer—as well as how to maintain it—is essential for keeping your home safe and comfortable.
