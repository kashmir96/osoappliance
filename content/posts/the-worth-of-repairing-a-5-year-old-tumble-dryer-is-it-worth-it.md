## Is Repairing a 5 Year Old Tumble Dryer Worth the Cost?

When your tumble dryer breaks down, you may be faced with the decision of whether to invest in repairs or replace the appliance altogether. If your tumble dryer is five years old, the decision becomes even more difficult, with both options offering a range of potential benefits and drawbacks. When weighing up the pros and cons, it is important to consider the cost of repairs versus that of replacement. 

The cost of repairing your 5 year old tumble dryer depends largely on the nature of the fault and the cost of spare parts needed. On one hand, repairs may be a more cost effective option if the fault is relatively minor or simple to fix. On the other hand, if the fault is more complex or costly to repair, you may have to consider investing in a replacement tumble dryer. Additionally, if you have a single source of tumble dryer parts, you may have to pay a premium to have your model maintained or repaired.

It is not just the cost of repairs or replacement that will likely impact your decision. Additional factors to consider may include the cost of energy spent operating your current tumble dryer, the reliability of your model, the availability of spare parts for your dryer, and the availability of an extended warranty.

When weighing up the two options, it is important to consider your own circumstance in order to make an informed decision that is well suited to you.
