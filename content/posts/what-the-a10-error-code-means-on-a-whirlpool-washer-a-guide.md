## A Guide to the A10 Error Code of Whirlpool Washers

If you own a Whirlpool washer and come across an error code A10, you may be wondering what it means. Never fear, this guide will explain all the information you need. 

Error Code A10 indicates your washer has an issue with draining. If an error code continues to display, this can cause damage or malfunction in the machine, so it's important to take action as soon as possible. To stop the error from displaying and/or causing any further damage, you should unplug your washer from the power source and wait for at least 15 seconds before plugging it back in.
