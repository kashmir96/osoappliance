When it comes to laundry appliances, the washing machine is usually the heavier of the two. This is because the washing machine contains a large drum that is filled with water, which adds to its weight. The dryer, on the other hand, is usually much lighter in comparison. This is because the dryer does not contain any water, and instead relies on hot air to dry clothes.

The average washing machine can weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 pounds, depending on the size and type. Front-loading washing machines tend to be heavier than top-loading models, as they contain a larger drum and more internal components. The average dryer, on the other hand, usually weighs between 75 and 125 pounds.

The weight of a washing machine or dryer can vary significantly depending on the model and brand. Some high-end models can weigh up to 300 pounds, while others may be much lighter. It is important to consider the weight of the appliance when deciding which one to purchase, as it can affect how easy it is to move and install.

In conclusion, the washing machine is usually the heavier of the two appliances. This is because it contains a large drum that is filled with water, which adds to its weight. The average washing machine can weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 pounds, while the average dryer usually weighs between 75 and 125 pounds.
