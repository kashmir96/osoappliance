If you hear a squeaking noise coming from your dryer, it can be very frustrating. It's likely that the source of the noise is one of several common causes, and fortunately most of these you can fix yourself. In this blog, we’ll look at some of the most common causes for a squeaky dryer and how to fix them on your own before calling in a repair service. 

One common cause for a noisy dryer is an overloaded drum. If you overload your dryer, not only will it squeak, but it won’t perform as well either. To fix this issue, simply reduce your load and be sure not to overfill the drum in the future. 

Another possible cause is worn out suspension rods or springs which support the drum. If these become worn or corroded they may start to squeak as they rotate during use. To fix this problem you can replace these parts with new ones that are compatible with your model of dryer - just make sure to get genuine OEM parts for best results! 

Another possible culprit could be worn out glides or supports which are located on either side of the drum and provide support as it rotates. If these become worn out or damaged then they may become noisy during use, so replacing them with new parts should help to solve this problem quickly and easily! 

Finally, an accumulation of lint around moving parts such as belts and pulleys can also cause noise in your dryer. To prevent this from happening make sure to clean out any accumulated lint regularly - ideally after each load - using a vacuum cleaner nozzle attachment specifically designed for cleaning appliances like dryers. This will help ensure all moving parts are free from debris which could cause them to become noisy over time! 

In conclusion if your dryer is making a squeaking noise there are several things you can check yourself before calling in a repair service: reducing loads where necessary; checking suspension rods/springs; replacing glides/supports; and cleaning any accumulated lint build up around moving parts such as belts/pulleys etc.. With just some basic maintenance work on our part we should be able to get our machines back up and running again without having to call anyone else in!
