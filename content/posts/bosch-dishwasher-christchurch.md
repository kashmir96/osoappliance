If you’re looking for a reliable, efficient and stylish dishwasher for your Christchurch home, then the Bosch range of dishwashers is an excellent choice. Bosch is renowned for its high quality appliances, and their range of dishwashers are no exception. With a wide variety of models to choose from, you can find the perfect one to suit your needs.

Bosch dishwashers come with a range of features that make them great value for money. The innovative EcoSilence Drive motor ensures powerful yet quiet cleaning performance, while the VarioSpeedPlus system cuts down on cycle times by up to 66%. You also have the option to use either conventional detergent or tablet detergents with these machines – so you can choose whichever suits your lifestyle best.

The ActiveWater technology found in all models helps ensure maximum water efficiency and helps reduce water wastage – so it’s not only good news for your wallet but also better news for the environment too! In addition, Bosch dishwashers feature AquaStop technology which offers complete protection against water damage - giving you added peace of mind in case of any unexpected leaks or floods.

These machines also come with handy extra options such as delay start times and extra rinsing cycles – so you can always get dishes done exactly when it suits you best! Plus there are several programs available that allow customised settings designed specifically to take care of delicate items such as glasses or china plates. 

Finally, all Bosch dishwashers come with an impressive two-year manufacturer warranty – so if anything should happen during that time they’ll be able to help out quickly and efficiently. All in all then – if you’re looking for an efficient yet stylish appliance that comes packed with useful features then a Bosch Dishwasher is definitely worth considering!
