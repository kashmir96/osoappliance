## Resetting Your Miele Appliances

Did you know that some of the common problems your Miele appliances face can be easily fixed? It's true, many of the issues you may have with your Miele oven, dishwasher, fridge, vacuum cleaner, or other are caused because of a simple reset. If you're having trouble getting your Miele appliances to work properly then you may need to do a reset to refresh your equipment.

A Miele reset is an easy and stress-free process. Before you begin, you should double-check to ensure that all the power is off or disconnected from the appliance. Once you have done this, you should open up the appliance to locate the circuit board. Here you should locate the reset button and press it until you hear a click. This should reset all settings and provide you with a refreshed appliance! 

Miele also provide useful diagrams of their products on their website, allowing anyone to easily locate where their reset button may be. Additionally, you may also find it useful to consult the user manual of your particular Miele product.

Once you have completed your reset, wait until all lights on the appliance have gone out before re-connecting the power. If you complete these steps correctly, you should be able to get your appliance working properly again.

If you are having ongoing problems with your Miele appliances and require the expertise of a professional, then be sure to book an appointment with a specialist.
