# Does a bigger dryer cost more to run

When it comes to dryers, bigger isn't always better. While a larger dryer may be able to handle more clothes in one load, it can also cost more to run. Here's why:

The larger the dryer, the more energy it takes to heat up and keep warm. This means that a bigger dryer will require more electricity or gas than a smaller one. Additionally, larger dryers tend to have more features and settings which can use up even more energy.

In addition to using more electricity or gas, bigger dryers also tend to take longer cycles than smaller ones. This means that you're likely using the appliance for longer periods of time, leading to higher utility bills. 

Finally, if you're looking for an energy-efficient model, bigger dryers may not always be your best option. Many of the most efficient models are actually smaller in size and capacity. These models typically have shorter cycle times and use less energy overall than their larger counterparts. 

When it comes down to it, a bigger dryer may not always be the most cost-effective option when it comes time to do your laundry. Consider all of your options before making a purchase so that you can find the model that best fits your needs â€“ and your budget!
