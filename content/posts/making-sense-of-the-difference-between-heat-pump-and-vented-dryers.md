## Heat pumps and vented dryers - What's the difference?

Have you been shopping around for the perfect clothes dryer? Then you might have come across the question of whether a heat pump or vented dryer is right for you. While both types are used in laundry rooms and serve the same general purpose of drying clothes, there are distinct differences between the two that may make one more suitable than the other for your lifestyle.

Heat pumps are often considered more energy-efficient than vented dryers and contain a special technology that captures hot air and reheats it, rather than using artificial heat to warm air. This allows them to use less power over a given drying cycle. To make up for a lack of heater, heat pumps ‘pump’ hot air from inside the machine instead and tend to be more expensive than their counterparts. They also may require somewhat more difficult installation and regular cleaning of the condenser to prevent lint build-up.

In contrast, vented dryers use an electric heater to heat air. This results in more energy usage and higher electricity bills, but it also means that drying takes less time, which can be a major plus for busy households. Vented dryers also tend to be more cost-effective for dryers than heat pumps and require less maintenance.

At the end of the day, the right choice comes down to your lifestyle and budget. Heat pumps can offer big savings on electricity bills, but that doesn’t mean they’re right for everyone. Vented dryers may cost a bit more in power over the course of their lifetime, but may be the better choice if you’re on a tighter budget.
