## Don't Stress About Troubleshooting GE Wall Oven Error Codes
Error codes can be a bit daunting for the regular consumer, so here is a handy guide to troubleshooting GE Wall Oven Error Codes.

The first thing to determine is the situation that you are in. Is the code flashing on the oven, or is it a warning code on the electronic display? These can range from an “F1” code to a “F2” code, or way up to an “F9” code, so it’s best to look up the specific model of your GE wall oven in order to determine the exact meaning of the code. For example, an “F1” code might indicate a control lockout, while an “F2” code might mean an oven over-temperature condition.

If the problem is electrical, such as if the oven won’t heat up, then the first step is to make sure the oven is properly connected to the wall outlet. Make sure the outlet is active and properly powered. Then make sure all connections are free from any corrosion or damage, which could lead to a loose connection and subsequent malfunction.

When dealing with the oven’s mechanical parts, such as when the fan doesn’t turn on or when the light isn’t working, first check the circuit breaker. Reset the breaker if necessary and make sure that power is flowing to the oven. If the problem persists, then it might be a good idea to contact a professional service technician. 

Whatever the issue, it’s always a good idea to check out the owner’s manual of the specific GE wall oven before attempting any fixes. Often, the codes and their meanings will be clearly laid out, saving you a lot of headaches.

Troubleshooting GE wall oven error codes doesn't have to be stressful and with a bit of knowledge and diligent effort, you'll soon be able to fix and enjoy using your oven as before.
