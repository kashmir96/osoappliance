An electric cooker is a stove that uses electricity to heat and cook food. They come in a variety of styles, sizes, and designs, depending on their intended use. There are four main types of electric cookers on the market: induction, ceramic, halogen, and radiant.

Induction cookers use electromagnetic energy to directly heat pots or pans placed on the cooktop. The heat generated is immediate and can be controlled precisely. These models typically cost more than other types of electric cookers but offer excellent cooking performance. 

Ceramic electric cookers use an electrical current to heat the hotplate which then transfers the heat to the pans placed on it for cooking. This type of cooker is usually more affordable than induction models and offers good temperature control along with even heating across the entire surface area of its hotplates. 

Halogen electric cookers work by radiating infrared light from halogen lamps inside an enclosed casing to quickly heat up pans placed on its hotplate surface which heats up instantly when switched on. It’s a reasonably priced option that offers quick heating but tends to require higher energy consumption than other types of electric cooker due to its continuous operation mode while in use. 

Last but not least, radiant electric cookers make use of high-temperature coils beneath an enamel plate or glass-ceramic plate that acts as a heat source when activated by electricity passing through it from below via electrical resistance heating elements (coils). This type often has a slower response time compared with other types as well as less precise temperature control features but remains one of the most popular options due to its affordability and ease-of-use features such as pre-sets for commonly cooked meals like pasta dishes or curries etc… 

Regardless of what type you choose for your home kitchen needs; all four variants will provide efficient cooking capabilities with varying levels features depending upon their price point & intended usage scenario – so do your research before deciding upon one!
