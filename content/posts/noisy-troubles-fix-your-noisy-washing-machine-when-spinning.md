## Troubleshooting A Noisy Washing Machine

Having a washing machine that is noisy while spinning can be a cause for irritation and concern. In this blog post, we'll discuss what may be causing the noise and how to fix the issue.

The first step is to diagnose the possible cause of the noise. If it sounds like the noise is coming from the bottom of the machine, it may be the drum bearings that need to be inspected or replaced. The drive belt may also be to blame, as it may be loose or damaged. Check the interior perimeter of the machine for any loose screws, bolts, or panels. Lastly, it could be the shock absorbers that are causing the racket. 

To replace the drum bearings, turn off the power and water and unplug the machine. Remove the front access panel of the machine to inspect the bearings. If they are worn or seized, the drum will need to be replaced. The shock absorbers should be checked for leakage, as a worn or wet shock absorber can cause noise. If the shock absorber isn’t wet and is securely fastened, but is still noisy, replacing it may be necessary. 

The drive belt can be easily replaced. The belt tension should also be checked and adjusted accordingly. The belt and tensioner can both be replaced separately if needed.

To conclude, diagnosing and solving the noise coming from a noisy washing machine can take some trial and error to determine what, exactly, the root of the problem is. If these tips and tricks don’t do the job, it's wise to contact a qualified appliance repair technician to assess and diagnose the issue.
