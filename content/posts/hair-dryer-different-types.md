When it comes to styling your hair, one of the most important tools you need is a hair dryer. Hair dryers come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and styles, so it's important to know the different types available in order to find the perfect one for your needs.

The two main types of hair dryers are conventional and ionic. Conventional hair dryers use heat to blow out warm air, while ionic models use negatively charged ions which help reduce frizz and static as well as making hair look shinier. Both kinds of hair dryers can be used for all types of styling needs, but they do have subtle differences that can make a big difference when it comes to achieving your desired look. 

Conventional Hair Dryers are the most basic type available today. They work by using heat from an electric coil or heating element to blow out a stream of hot air from the nozzle. This makes them great for quickly drying wet or damp hair and creating volume with a round brush as you blow-dry. 

Ionic Hair Dryers are becoming increasingly popular due its ability to reduce frizz and static as well as adding shine and softness to your style. Ionic models work by emitting negative ions which help break down water molecules more quickly than conventional dryers so that they evaporate faster while also helping with reducing flyaways caused by static electricity buildup in the air around you. 

Both types of hair dryers are great tools for styling your hair at home, but if you want maximum performance then an ionic model is probably best suited for your needs due its ability to reduce frizz and add shine while drying quickly too!
