It may be hard to believe, but yes, a dirty dishwasher can make you sick. A recent study from the University of Arizona found that dishwashers can be a breeding ground for harmful bacteria and viruses if not regularly cleaned or maintained. The buildup of food particles and other residues in the nooks and crannies of the appliance provide an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. In addition, a dishwasher’s high-temperature water creates steam that can spread germs around your kitchen.

The most common culprits are Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. These bacteria can cause foodborne illnesses such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever and headaches if ingested in high enough concentrations. Additionally, they can also lead to more serious health problems such as meningitis or even death in extreme cases.

So how do you prevent getting sick from your dishwasher? It all starts with regular cleaning and maintenance of the appliance itself as well as its surrounding area. Clean all interior surfaces of the dishwasher regularly with hot soapy water or a mild disinfectant solution diluted according to manufacturer’s directions. Make sure to scrub away any visible dirt or residue on racks or other parts where it might accumulate over time. Also clean out any food particles that get caught in the filters or spray arms before rinsing them off with running water each time you run the machine's cycle. Finally, keep your kitchen counters clean by wiping them down after every use with an antibacterial cleaner or bleach solution (1 tablespoon bleach per gallon of water). This will help reduce cross contamination between dirty dishes and other surfaces around your kitchen which could then give rise to food poisoning organisms if not taken care of properly 

By following these guidelines closely you should be able to keep yourself safe from any potential harm caused by unclean dishes coming out of your dishwasher!
