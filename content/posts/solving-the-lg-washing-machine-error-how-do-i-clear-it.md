## Clearing an LG Washing Machine Error Code
Being faced with an unidentified error code on your LG Washing Machine can be frustrating. If it’s preventing you from getting your clothes clean, you want to get them in the wash as soon as possible. Here’s how you can successfully clear an error code from your LG washer and get it running smoothly again.

First, make sure that your water supply valves are open. This is the most common cause of error codes appearing in LG washers. Open the two valves (the hot and cold one) that are connected to the wall and make sure each is completely turned on.

If the valves are already open, make sure the hoses connecting the machine to the valves are secure. Unplug the washing machine, pull it out from the wall, and check the hoses for leaks or loose connections. If the hoses are old, consider replacing them with more dependable ones.

LG washers are able to detect if there's an ink stain, dirt, or other particles stuck to a piece of laundry. If so, the machine refuses to work and an error code appears. For this reason, it’s important to check every piece of laundry before putting it in the machine.

If these steps don't solve the problem, it would be a good idea to consult a specialist or check the manual that came with your washing machine. The manual will provide further instructions to help you clear the code, or it might point out a potentially serious issue that might be preventing the washer from functioning properly.

The last thing to keep in mind when dealing with LG washing machine error codes is that some codes require you to reset the washing machine. To do this, you can either unplug it from the power source for a few minutes and then plug it back in, or try pressing the POWER and the START/PAUSE button simultaneously.
