Have you ever wondered how a refrigerator works? It's amazing that such a small appliance can keep food cold for days and weeks at a time. The secret to the fridge's cooling power lies in the refrigeration cycle, which is composed of four key parts: evaporator, compressor, condenser and expansion valve. Together, these parts create a closed loop system that removes heat from the inside of your fridge and dissipates it outside.

The refrigeration cycle starts with the evaporator. This is located inside your fridge and consists of metal coils filled with liquid refrigerant (a chemical that absorbs heat). As warm air passes over these coils, the liquid refrigerant absorbs the heat from it and evaporates into gas form. This process cools down the air inside your refrigerator.

Next up is the compressor, located outside your fridge near its back or side wall. The compressed gas from the evaporator flows through this device where it is further compressed into an even hotter state before moving on to the condenser coil located behind or below your refrigerator. In this state, it is so hot it actually radiates heat away from itself! As this happens, temperatures drop significantly as unwanted heat escapes your refrigerator's interior walls though its back panel or side wall vents instead of entering into them — thus keeping them cool! 

The third part involved in cooling down your fridge is called a condenser coil — essentially metal tubing wrapped around a series of flat plates situated behind or below your refrigerator (or sometimes even inside). The hot compressed gas from earlier moves through these condenser coils where its temperature drops further; meanwhile any residual heat escapes outside through vents built into either side walls or back panels of most fridges today. 

Finally, we arrive at our fourth part – an expansion valve installed between both sides of our closed loop system–between evaporation stage & compressor stage–it helps control flow rates & pressures within entire refrigeration cycle allowing temperatures to be regulated as desired by user! This allows for maximum efficiency when cooling down food stored within one’s refrigerator unit; ultimately leading us full circle back to why we opened this blog up in first place--to explain why fridges work so well at keeping food cold!
