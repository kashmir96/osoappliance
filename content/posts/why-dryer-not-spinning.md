If your dryer isn’t spinning, it can be a real hassle. There are several potential causes of this issue, but thankfully, some of them are easy to identify and fix without calling in a professional. Here are a few things to try before reaching out to an appliance repair technician from our directory.

Check the Dryer Lint Trap 
The lint trap built into your dryer catches debris from clothes as they dry. This debris can clog up the airflow in your dryer and stop it from spinning properly. Check the lint trap for any blockages or large clumps of lint that could be preventing proper air circulation, and remove them if you find any.

Check Your Power Source 
If your dryer isn’t getting power, then it won’t spin—it’s as simple as that! Check that the power is connected properly to both your outlet and the machine itself. If everything seems connected correctly then you may need to call an electrician to troubleshoot further.

Clean Out Any Obstructions 
From time-to-time large items can fall behind or underneath your dryer while doing laundry; these items can obstruct airflow and cause your machine not spin properly. Carefully remove any objects that may have fallen behind or underneath the machine using a vacuum cleaner or broom handle extension, if needed!

Replace Your Dryer Belt 
If none of these solutions help solve your problem then there is a chance that the motor belt inside of your drying has worn out over time; replacing this part should fix any issues with spining related problems quickly and easily! You will likely need professional help for this one though so make sure to contact an appliance repair technician from our directory if needed.
