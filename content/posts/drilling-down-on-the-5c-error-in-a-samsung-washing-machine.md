## Understanding the 5C Error in a Samsung Washing Machine
If roughly two-thirds of the world's population owns a washing machine, it's likely one of them is a Samsung. But while its power and efficiency is one of its greatest selling points, machine malfunction is inevitable in its lifetime. One such error code, **5C**, is worth further investigationâ€“ so read on to learn how to diagnose and resolve the issue.

The 5C error code can indicate two different things. On one hand, it can signify a water drain issue, meaning the washer is having difficulty draining any water present. Check to make sure the washer is draining the water properly and clean out any debris that is blocking the filter to prevent a circulatory blockage.

On the other hand, the 5C can also be related to a malfunctioning main control board, a crucial part to any laundry unit. Whenever the control board has difficulty working or communicating with other parts of the washer, the 5C error is likely to be shown. If this is the case, it is advised to have a professional come out and improve the unit.

Error 5C is an issue that needs to be tackled right away, as this can result in spoilage of your clothing if the issue is left unresolved.
