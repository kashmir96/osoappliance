## What You Should Know About General Kitchen Layout 

Creating an easy-to-use, comfortable kitchen is a key part of any home's design. To ensure your kitchen follows an efficient, sensible layout, there are certain universal design principles that are known as the general rule in kitchen layout. Taking these principles into consideration can help make a kitchen look more organized and make it easier to use. 

In general, the kitchen layout should have the stove, oven, refrigerator, and sink within sensible (preferably even) distances from each other. This will create a good "work triangle" with the correct balance between the main workstations. Each of these areas should each have their own countertop area and easily accessible cabinets above. Additionally, make sure to leave some room for extra storage, such as a pantry. 

When designing a kitchen, take into account the people who will be using it. If the layout isn't comfortable for the people in the household, it won't be very effective. For example, if a tall person is often using the kitchen, then the placement of the cabinets should take that into consideration. 

Speaking of cabinets, having an appropriate size and number of them is essential for the kitchen to function properly. Good kitchen designs plan for both upper and lower cabinets, with upper cabinets being mainly used for dishes and appliances that you don't need to access as often. Everything that you do access often, such as dishes and pots, can go in the lower cabinets. 

These principles create an overall efficient, user-friendly kitchen. However, don't be afraid to adapt them to fit the space or your own needs. Thinking of new layouts and endearing features that work for your space can create a kitchen that's both beautiful and easy to use. 

When planning a kitchen, it is important to consider the general rule of kitchen layout. Following established design principles will help you create a kitchen that is efficient and comfortable for everyone who uses it.
