A commercial blender is a type of blender that is designed for commercial use. It typically features a powerful motor and durable construction that makes it suitable for use in restaurants, cafeterias, bars, and other food service establishments. Commercial blenders are usually larger than standard home blenders and they come with more features. 

When looking for a commercial blender, the most important thing to consider is the power of the motor. Generally speaking, you want to look for a blender with at least 1 horsepower or 750 watts of power. This will ensure your blender can handle tough ingredients like ice cubes and frozen fruit without slowing down or overloading the motor. Additionally, look for a model with multiple speed options so you can adjust its speed depending on what ingredients you're blending. 

Durability is also important when looking at commercial blenders as these machines will be used multiple times throughout the day in busy environments. Look for models that either have stainless steel components or are made from plastic materials that won't corrode or crack over time. Also make sure the pitcher or container is shatter-proof and heat resistant so it won't break if there's an accident while blending hot liquids like soups or sauces. 

Finally, consider any extra features offered by different models as they can make all the difference in convenience and ease of use when preparing recipes each day. Some higher-end models offer pre-programmed settings tailored to specific recipes like smoothies and milkshakes while others may include additional attachments such as chopping blades or graters that allow you to do more than just blend items together quickly and efficiently. 

When shopping around for a commercial blender in the UK, there are plenty of options available from both local retailers as well as online retailers like Amazon UK where you can compare prices from different vendors to get the best deal possible on your new machine!
