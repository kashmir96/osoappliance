## Salvaging and Reusing Parts from a Washing Machine

There are many reasons to consider salvaging parts from an old washing machine. You may have an antique machine that you’d like to keep running or you may have an old machine that no longer works, but still contains some functioning parts. In either case, there is value in taking apart a washing machine and removing certain parts for reuse.

The most obvious part you can remove and reuse is the motor. If the motor is still functioning, it can be salvaged and used in another laundry machine. This can help you save money on appliance repairs and replacement parts. Other possible reusable components include the belt, timer, and wiring. Most washing machines are composed of carefully crafted parts, so there is usually a few components you can save and reuse in other appliances.

When it comes to actually salvaging the parts, however, it’s important to be safety conscious. Carefully unscrew components, take a picture for reference as you go, and lay the pieces out in a safe, organized way so you won’t forget how to put them back together. Figure out what tools you need in advance, and don’t force anything.

When you’re taking apart the washing machine, remember that the more parts you can save, the better. With a little bit of work and the right tools, you can end up with some valuable spare parts and save money on repairs and replacements.
