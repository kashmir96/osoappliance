# Fix washing machine stop spinning

If your washing machine has suddenly stopped spinning, it can be a stressful and inconvenient situation. Fortunately, there are several things you can do to troubleshoot the issue and get your washing machine back up and running. 

The first thing you should do is check to make sure the machine is plugged in and that the outlet is working. If the outlet is working, then you should check the power cord for any damage or fraying. If the cord is damaged, it will need to be replaced. 

Next, you should check the timer knob to make sure it is in the correct position. If the timer is in the wrong position, it can cause the machine to stop spinning. 

If the timer knob is in the correct position, then you should check the belt. The belt is responsible for spinning the drum, so if it is loose or damaged, it can cause the machine to stop spinning. To check the belt, you will need to remove the back panel of the washing machine. Once the panel is removed, you should be able to see the belt. If the belt is loose or damaged, it will need to be replaced. 

If the belt is in good condition, then you should check the motor. The motor is responsible for powering the spinning of the drum, so if it is not working properly, the machine will not spin. While the back panel is off, you should also be able to see the motor. If the motor is not spinning there are a few potential causes.

A) Your motor brushes may be worn (common),
Motor brushes are responsible for providing electricity to your washing machine motor, if your motor isn't moving at all when on a spin cycle there's a good chance this is the cause. To inspect, unplug the machine and take off the back panel, remove the belt and remove the bolts holding in the motor and pry off the motor with a small crowbar or large screwdriver. With the motor out, unscrew the two plastic housings for motor brushes (or push the clip tabs and pull the brushes out by the spring).

If upon inspection these are short (under a couple centimetres of carbon) it's a good indication that it's time to replace, thankfully these are cheap to buy and quick to install. Install the brushes and put everything back together by reversing the steps above. Clear any errors on your control panel (google how to clear for your specific machine / number) and then attempt to run again.

B) You could have something wrong with your drain pump or hose (also common).
Likely issues include a blockage in the pipe or something stuck in the pump like a hairpin or coin. Open the small door at the bottom front corner of the machine and take out the plug (beware water will come out), inspect in and around the pump for signs of debris. Test the machine with this off, if the small pump doesn't move freely or at all it may be faulty and need replaced.

As a last check in this area, take off the bottom of the machine, unscrew the pump from the front of the machine and pull out the pump. Take all pipes off and check down the tubes, sometimes things can get caught and hide in there invisible from the front.

Warning: the next steps can get quite a bit more expensive, and it's often more cost effective to just replace the machine.

C) You might have a short circuited control board
If your control board is shorted, you usually have other symptoms like loss of power by blowing a fuse at the mains or in the machine, you also could have a blank washing machine control panel with no lights coming on. However, I have seen it occur where the motor stops.

If you are handy and have a solid understanding of electrical circuits you can pry off the front control panel of the washing machine and inspect in behind for signs of burning. Usually the green computer board or the capacitors attached will be hot spots for this.

D) Your machine's motor might be faulty.
If all the above are still not winners, there's a good chance its the motor itself. You often can tell a bad motor because it has a strong smell to it or black soot inside the machine. If you don't have signs of the above, you can use a multimeter to check the readings on the motor, this is quite technical and the readings vary from machine to machine so it's recommended you search YouTube for videos demonstrating this on your specific machine.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and fix the issue with your washing machine. If you are still having trouble, it is best to call a professional to help you.
