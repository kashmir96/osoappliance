If your washing machine is not draining water, it can be a major inconvenience. Fortunately, there are a few solutions you can try to get your washing machine draining again. 

The most common cause of a washing machine not draining is a clog in the drain hose or pump. The drain hose connects the washing machine to the drain pipe that carries the water away. Over time, lint, dirt, and debris can build up in the hose, causing a blockage. Similarly, the pump may become clogged with debris, preventing it from draining water properly. 

Another potential cause of a washing machine not draining is a faulty drain pump. The pump is responsible for pushing water out of the washing machine. If it is damaged, the washer won’t be able to drain water properly. 

If your washing machine is not draining, the first thing you should do is check the drain hose and pump for any blockages. If you find a blockage, try to remove it with a vacuum or a drain snake. 

If the drain hose and pump are clear, the next step is to check the drain pump. To do this, you will need to access the pump and inspect it for any signs of damage. If it appears to be damaged, you will need to replace it. 

Finally, if the drain pump is in good condition, the last thing to check is the wiring. Make sure all of the wires are securely connected, as a loose connection could be preventing the washing machine from draining properly. 

If you’ve tried all of these solutions and the washing machine still isn’t draining, it’s time to call in a professional. A technician can diagnose the problem and get your washing machine draining again in no time.
