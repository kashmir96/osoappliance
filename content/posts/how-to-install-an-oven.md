# How to install an oven

Installing an oven is a relatively straightforward process, but it’s important to make sure that you do it correctly to ensure safety and optimal performance. Here are the steps you need to take when installing an oven:

1. Read the instructions: Before you start the installation process, make sure that you read through all of the instructions that come with your oven. This will help ensure that you understand all of the steps involved in the installation process and can avoid any potential mistakes.

2. Choose a location: Select a suitable location for your oven, taking into consideration factors such as ventilation and access to power outlets. Make sure that there is enough space around the oven for air circulation and easy access when using it.

3. Prepare the area: Once you have chosen a location for your oven, prepare the area by clearing away any obstructions or clutter from around it. Make sure that there is nothing flammable within three feet of your oven and check for any gas or water lines nearby before continuing with the installation process.

4. Connect power supply: Connect your oven to a dedicated electrical outlet or circuit breaker box, making sure that it has sufficient power supply for its wattage rating (check this in your instruction manual). Be careful not to overload circuits or use extension cords as this can be dangerous! 

5. Install mounting brackets: If necessary, install mounting brackets on either side of your oven according to manufacturer’s instructions (most modern models come pre-installed with brackets). Make sure they are securely attached and level before continuing with the next step. 

6. Securely mount your oven: Place your oven onto its mounting brackets and secure it firmly in place using screws or bolts (again, check manufacturer’s instructions). Once securely mounted, check again for levelness before plugging in power supply cable into wall socket/circuit breaker box (if applicable). 

7. Test run: Finally, test run your newly installed oven by setting its temperature control knob to its highest setting and allowing it to heat up for several minutes (this will also help burn off any manufacturing oils). Once heated up properly, turn off power supply at wall socket/circuit breaker box before opening door/drawer to inspect inside of unit for any damage or debris left behind during installation process (if present, contact manufacturer immediately). 

 Congratulations! You have now successfully installed an oven!
