## Deciphering Washing Symbols: A Simple Guide 
Every day, washing clothes can feel like a chore, but using the right laundry symbols can make it a lot easier - and save time and money. Symbols on your washing labels might look like a code, but these symbols actually provide important information about how best to care for clothes. In this post, we'll provide a simple guide to washing symbols; giving you the knowledge to decode them, and the ability to best care for your clothes. 

The shape of the symbol: The first group of laundry symbols includes a square, circle, triangle, and a few other shapes. These symbols tell you exactly how you should be cleaning: 

- Square/Rectangle: Indicates clothing should be machine-washed. This can also include a number within the shape, which will give you the maximum temperature for your machine; up to 95°C.
- Triangle (pointing downwards): You should turn the item inside out before washing, and wash separately or with similar coloured items. 
- Circle: You should wash this item in a washing machine, but with certain care. This usually includes a number inside the circle, which tells you the maximum temperature your laundry should be set to in order to maintain its quality. 

The number and type of lines: The second group of laundry symbols come in the form of lines. These lines represent the level of agitation and heat your clothes will require during the laundry process: 

- One line: Indicates hand washing in cold water 
- Two lines: Clothing should be washed in a machine washer, but with gentle cycle 
- Three lines: Suggests machine washing on a regular cycle 
- Four lines: Washing at high temperatures, up to 95°C.

Other symbols: Aside from shapes and lines, there are a few additional symbols that you should look for on the clothing label: 

- An X, indicating this item should not be washed 
- A hand, signifying that the item should be washed with delicate hands 
- Small dots, suggesting the item should be washed in the dryer. 

By taking the time to decode laundering symbols, you can better maintain the quality of your clothing.
