## Understanding the 'PE' Error Code on an LG Washing Machine 

For homeowners using an LG washing machine, the occurrence of certain error codes can sometimes leave them feeling a little unnerved. This can be particularly true if it's their first time seeing the code pop up. One such code that some unlucky homeowners may come across from time to time is the 'PE' code. In this blog post, we'll explain what this error code actually means and how to address it.

When the PE error code appears in an LG washing machine, it typically indicates a problem with how the machine is draining water. Specifically, it indicates that the machine's water drainage hose is too high or disconnected from the sink or drain. This is likely due to incorrect installation of the machine. It's important to ensure the drainage hose is securely connected to the sink or drain in the home and that there are no kinks or bends in the hose that could impede water drainage. Additionally, the drain hose should never be higher than the height of the machine itself as this could alter the water pressure as it flows out of the machine. 

Should the PE code appear several times, usually this is an indication that there is actually a problem with the washing machine's water pump. If this is the case, then that is a job that you should leave up to a trained professional and contact LG's appliance service.

The PE error code can be a bit daunting to see if you've never dealt with it before. By understanding the cause of this code, however, homeowners can take steps to remedy and avoid the error in the future.
