When it comes to keeping your commercial dryer running, regular maintenance and repair is a must. Whether you have a gas or electric dryer, it’s important to keep up with repairs in order to ensure that your dryer runs efficiently and safely. In this blog, we’ll discuss some of the more common issues associated with commercial dryers and how you can go about repairing them yourself.

One of the most common problems with commercial dryers is lint buildup. Lint can accumulate on the heating element, causing it to overheat and shut off prematurely or fail altogether. To prevent lint buildup from occurring in the first place, make sure you clean out your lint trap regularly as well as any other areas inside and around your machine where lint may accumulate. Additionally, if you notice that clothes are taking longer than usual to dry or they seem unusually hot after being taken out of the machine, this could be an indication that there is a problem with your heating element – so be sure to check this area for signs of damage or blockage before attempting any repairs yourself. 

Another issue that can occur with commercial dryers is a broken drive belt or pulley system which prevents the unit from spinning properly when in use. In order to repair this issue yourself, you will need access to both sides of the machine in order to replace any broken parts such as drive belts or pulleys which may have become worn down over time due to heavy usage. If these parts are beyond repair then they will need replacing - however if they are still intact but simply slipping then you may be able to re-tension them by adjusting their tension screws located at either end of each belt/pulley system (depending on make/model). 

Finally, if your commercial dryer isn't spinning at all then there could be an issue with its motor – either caused by too much voltage being applied or because its bearings have worn down over time due excessive usage (or both). If this is indeed what's causing the problem then unfortunately it's likely best left for professional repairmen since motors can be quite complex pieces of machinery which require special tools and knowledge when diagnosing/repairing them correctly - however if you're feeling brave enough then there are some DIY tutorials online which provide step-by-step instructions on how best fix a faulty motor (albeit at own risk!). 

Overall then while commercial dryers may not require too much upkeep when compared against residential models – regular cleaning/maintenance combined with prompt attention whenever problems do arise is definitely key in ensuring that yours continues running smoothly for many years into future!
