If you’re a pet owner, you know that pet hair can be a real nuisance. It gets everywhere, and it can be hard to keep up with. Vacuuming is one of the best ways to keep pet hair under control, but not all vacuums are created equal. To make sure you’re getting the best vacuum for pet hair, there are a few things to consider.

First, look for a vacuum with a powerful motor. Pet hair can be stubborn, so you need a vacuum with enough suction to pick it up. Look for a vacuum with at least 12 amps of power. This will ensure that the vacuum is strong enough to pick up all the pet hair.

Next, look for a vacuum with a brush roll. A brush roll is a rotating brush that helps to agitate the carpet and loosen up pet hair. This will make it easier for the vacuum to pick up all the pet hair.

Finally, look for a vacuum with a HEPA filter. HEPA filters are designed to trap very small particles, like pet hair. This will help to keep the air in your home free from pet hair and other allergens.

These are just a few tips to help you find the best vacuum for pet hair. With the right vacuum, you can keep your home clean and free of pet hair.

1. Dyson Ball Animal 2 Upright Vacuum

2. Shark Navigator Lift-Away Professional Upright Vacuum
