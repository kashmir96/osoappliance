## Identifying & Avoiding Stove Hazards

Stove hazards are common risks to be aware of when using household appliances. In today's modern life, appliances are a large part of everyday cooking activities, and it is important to know the potential dangers that can arise when using a stove. This article will discuss the common risks to be aware of and how to avoid these hazards when using a stove. 

One of the most common types of stove hazards is the risk of fire. It is extremely important to be mindful of the stovetop when using the cooking appliance, especially if using multiple burners at the same time. Rings should not overlap and combustible liquids should be kept away from the stove. It is also important to check the appliance’s electrical wiring for any frayed or damaged cables. 

In addition to the fire risk, another stove hazard can be the presence of hazardous gases, such as carbon monoxide. This gas is odorless and colorless, making it nearly impossible to detect without a detector. The best way to avoid hazardous gases is by regularly inspecting and cleaning the stove burner, as well as making sure the vent hood is free of debris. 

Finally, the most common safety technique used when handling a stove is to be aware of the temperatures. Whether a pot is boiling or an oven is preheating, it is important to not operate a stove appliance above the manufacturer’s suggested levels. This will help keep the appliance free of damage and reduce the risk of injury. 

Stove hazards are a real danger that should never be taken lightly. Knowing the risks and understanding how to properly handle a stove appliance is key to avoiding any potential hazards.
