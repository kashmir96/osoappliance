When it comes to laundry appliances, many people are unaware of the differences between washing machines and dryers. One of the main differences between the two is that washing machines require transport bolts, while dryers do not.

Transport bolts are a set of four bolts located on the back of the washing machine. They are designed to secure the drum and other internal components during transportation. This helps to prevent the drum from shifting and damaging the internal components of the machine.

When a washing machine is transported, the transport bolts must be tightened to secure the drum and other components. This helps to keep the drum from moving around and damaging the interior of the machine. Without the transport bolts, the drum could shift and cause damage to the internal components of the machine.

In contrast, dryers do not require transport bolts. This is because the drum of a dryer is not as prone to shifting and damaging the internal components of the machine. Dryers are typically lighter than washing machines, and the drum is not as large or heavy, which makes it less likely to shift during transportation.

In conclusion, washing machines require transport bolts to secure the drum and other internal components during transportation. This helps to prevent the drum from shifting and damaging the internal components of the machine. Dryers, on the other hand, do not require transport bolts because the drum is less prone to shifting and damaging the internal components of the machine.
