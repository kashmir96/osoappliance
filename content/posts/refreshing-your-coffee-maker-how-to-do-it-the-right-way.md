## Refresh your Coffee Maker and Avoid Disruptions

Maintaining your coffee maker regularly can help you maintain better tasting coffee and keep your machine working efficiently. Doing these minor steps will ensure that not only do you get delicious tasting coffee every morning, but that you can continue using this appliance without disrupting your routine. In this blog, we'll cover the basics of how to refresh a coffee maker.

The most important part of refreshing a coffee maker is cleaning. Make sure to do this step every month. First, take all removable aspects of the coffee maker apart, such as the pot, filter, and lid. Wash each part with soap and warm water in the sink and make sure to rinse them off thoroughly, then let them air dry before putting them back together. Next, use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior of the coffee maker.

Now, begin the interior cleaning process. Run white vinegar and water through the machine. This will help clear out any built up mineral deposits or debris, and will also help keep the machine running better by preventing corrosion or rust. Let the machine set for 30 minutes, then run a few cycles of plain water to make sure all of the vinegar has been cleared out. Finally, clean the coffee filter with warm water, again making sure it's thoroughly rinsed before using it.

By taking these simple steps, you can ensure your coffee maker works efficiently and that you get a delicious cup of coffee every morning. In addition, the steps covered here can also be used for many types of kitchen appliances, like your range, dishwasher, and refrigerator.
