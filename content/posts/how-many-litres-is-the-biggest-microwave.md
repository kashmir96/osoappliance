The largest microwave available on the market today is the Sharp R-1874 Over-the-Range Convection Microwave Oven, which has a capacity of 1.8 cubic feet. This translates to approximately 5.2 litres of space inside the oven, making it one of the biggest microwaves available for purchase. 

This large capacity means that you’ll be able to fit multiple dishes at once while still having enough room to cook them with ease. The convection feature also allows you to prepare meals quickly and evenly by circulating heated air around food as it cooks—which is perfect for large dishes or groups of people. 

In addition, this model also offers advanced sensor technology that can detect when food is cooked and shut off automatically so you don’t have to worry about overcooking or burning your meal. It also comes with other convenient features such as a defrost setting, quick start buttons, and fourteen different power levels so you can customize your cooking experience according to your needs. 

The Sharp R-1874 microwave oven is an excellent choice if you’re looking for a large capacity appliance that can handle all of your cooking needs without taking up too much space in your kitchen.
