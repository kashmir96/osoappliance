## Clearing Samsung Refrigerator Error Codes
It's important to know how to respond appropriately when your Samsung Refrigerator throws an error code. This guide will help walk you through the process of clearing those codes so that no further problems arise.

If your Samsung Refrigerator is displaying an error code, the best first step is to locate the code in the user manual which came with your appliance. This will give you a direct explanation of the error and what you need to do in order to resolve it.

If you no longer have the user manual, it's important to take a photo of the error code, or write it down in order to ensure accuracy when searching online.

Often times the error codes can be cleared simply by unplugging the appliance and plugging it back in. This helps reset the control board and the error code should disappear. If it does not, then identify and locate the problem in the user manual. 

Sometimes you may need to replace a specific part and in those cases, it's best that you call a certified technician or servicing company and have them help you work through the problem.

In some scenarios, the error code may indicate a system-wide manufacturer defect that needs to be identified and resolved by Samsung. Depending on the specific defect it can be resolved with a simple part replacement, or the need for a full on warranty service. 

Understanding and owning your Samsung Refrigerator error codes will help you troubleshoot any issues quickly and cost effectively.
