## Refrigerator Freezer Lifespan | How Long Can You Expect It to Last?
Modern refrigerator freezers are built to last and their average lifespan is quite long, but that doesn’t mean they’ll last forever. Knowing how long yours should last can help you make informed decisions about when to buy a new one, or if you should repair the one you have.

When trying to estimate the age of your refrigerator freezer, it's important to look at when it was manufactured. According to The Home Depot, contemporary models typically last between 10-17 years - the average appliance lifespan is 12 years. When purchasing an appliance, remember to check for the best warranties available so that you can get the most out of your purchase. Some companies may even guarantee their appliances to last up to 20 years. 

It’s also important to keep in mind that the more you use your refrigerator freezer, the more quickly it will wear down. In order to best maintain your fridge, clean the interior every couple of weeks and address small problems as soon as you notice them. This can help to avoid bigger problems and costly repairs in the future.

Unfortunately, no matter how old or well-maintained your refrigerator freezer is, it won’t last forever. Regular wear and tear and frequent usage can have an impact on the age of the appliance and you may have to replace it sooner rather than later if not maintained correctly.

Modern refrigerator freezers are designed to last, but knowing the average lifespan and understanding the signs of wear can help you determine when it’s best to switch to a new model. For greater convenience, consider looking through our comprehensive appliance error codes glossary and contact an expert if necessary.
