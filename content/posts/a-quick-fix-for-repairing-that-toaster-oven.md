##A Simple Repair for Your Toaster Oven
Having a toaster oven in the house is a great convenience to make quick snacks, side dishes, and even small meals. If something is wrong with your toaster oven, then it no longer becomes a convenience. Instead of rushing to replace it, follow these simple steps to repair your toaster oven.

###Assessment
The first step in repairing a toaster oven is to assess the problem. Are the heating elements heating up? Does the timer work? Does the fan work? Is it just not cooking food properly? This can help you decide if you feel comfortable repairing it or if further help is necessary. 

###Check the Wiring
Faulty wiring can be one of the main sources of problems in toaster ovens. For this step, switch off all power to the toaster oven and remove the back panel. Carefully inspect the elements, the wires, the fan, and the timer switch to be sure everything is connected properly. If something doesnâ€™t look right, it may be best to leave the repair to a professional or purchase a new toaster oven. 

###Check the Heating Elements
If the heating elements do not seem to be working, first check to see that power is actually being supplied. If the power is not coming through, it could be a wiring or fuse problem and a professional may be needed. If power is being supplied, replace the heating elements.

###Clean the Oven
If you want to get the best performance out of your toaster oven, be sure to keep the oven itself clean. Food particles and grease can actually block heat. Take the time periodically to clean out the oven to make sure it is performing at its peak.

Taking the time to assess, check the wiring, check the heating elements, and clean your toaster oven can help you get it back in working order and give you the convenience of toasting snacks and cooking meals in your home with ease. These simple repairs and maintenance can help you be sure that your toaster oven performs to its best.
