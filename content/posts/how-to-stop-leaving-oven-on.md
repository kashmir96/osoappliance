# How to stop leaving oven on

Ovens are a great invention and help us cook delicious meals, but they can be dangerous if left on accidentally. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to prevent this from happening. 

First and foremost, always double-check that your oven is off when you’re finished cooking. It’s easy to get distracted with other tasks and forget that the oven is still on. To make sure it’s definitely off, turn the knob or switch all the way counterclockwise until it clicks off before you leave the kitchen. 

If you have an electric stovetop with knobs below your oven, also make sure these knobs are switched off after use too! Even if something isn't in use at the same time as your oven being used - such as a burner or broiler - having them on creates an electrical load which could activate some of its safety features (like automatic shutoff). This means that even if all of your knobs were turned to "off", it's still possible for them to turn back on due to this electrical load! 

In addition to physically checking for switches being in the correct position before leaving home (or going up stairs), another preventative measure homeowners can take is installing a carbon monoxide detector near their stovetop/oven area; this will detect any potentially hazardous levels of CO2 released by an active appliance while no one is home – allowing time for action before any serious damage occurs!  Lastly, consider investing in a timer switch that automatically turns off appliances at set times throughout each day; this will give peace-of-mind knowing appliances won't stay operational longer than necessary without someone physically present there manually shutting them down first—perfect for those who may forget or become easily distracted when cooking!  

Overall, leaving an oven running without supervision can be dangerous—but thankfully there are simple steps we can take today like double-checking switches & investing in alarms/timers so we don't have worry about leaving one active accidently anymore!
