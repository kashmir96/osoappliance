# Washing machine not draining

If your washing machine isn’t draining properly, it can be a major inconvenience. Not only does it mean that you have to wait longer for your clothes to finish washing, but it can also lead to water damage in your home. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the issue.

The first thing you should do is check the drain hose. This is the tube that connects the washer to the drainpipe. Make sure that it isn’t clogged or kinked, as this could be causing a blockage in the drainage system. If it looks like there’s an issue with the hose, replace it with a new one.

Next, check the pump filter for any debris or lint buildup. This filter is located at the bottom of the washer and should be cleaned out regularly to prevent clogs from forming. If there’s a lot of lint or other debris blocking up the filter, remove it carefully and then rinse out the filter with warm water before replacing it back into its housing.

Finally, make sure that your drainpipe isn’t blocked by anything else such as hair or soap scum buildup. If so, use an appropriate cleaner to clear away any blockages before running another cycle on your washer. You may also want to check for any air gaps in your plumbing system which could be causing water to back up into your washer instead of draining properly.

If none of these solutions work, then you may need to call in a professional plumber who can diagnose and fix any deeper issues with your drainage system. In some cases, they may even recommend replacing certain parts such as pipes or pumps if they are too worn out or damaged beyond repair.
