## Fixing a Malfunctioning Dishwasher
Have you ever gone to unload your dishes only to find the dishwasher isn’t working properly? It is frustrating to have to use manual labor to clean dishes, but there is hope! It is possible to troubleshoot a dishwasher and get it working again. 

To get started, use the power switch to turn the dishwasher off. If the dishwasher has any electronic components, pressing the off button is a good idea. If the dishwasher lacks a power switch, unplug it directly from the wall outlet to shut off power to the unit. 

The next step is to open up the dishwasher and take a look inside. Inspect the dishwasher’s door gasket and make sure it is firmly in place and is not leaking any water. Check for any broken or disconnected wires, and check all hoses to make sure they are free from kinks and clogs. 

The dishwasher’s filter should also be examined for any accumulations of food and grease. If any large chunks of food are found, remove them and rinse the filter with warm soapy water. If the filter is particularly dirty, it should be replaced. 

Finally, make sure that the dishwasher is replaced with its appropriate electrical connection. This can be done by checking the home’s wiring. Any wire splices should be screened, and the dishwasher should be plugged into an outlet with ground-fault circuit interrupter protection. 

Troubleshooting a malfunctioning dishwasher isn’t always easy, but it can be done. If these steps alone do not solve the issue, the dishwasher’s error code may provide additional insight. For help decoding your appliance’s error codes, refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). With this tool, you can troubleshoot your dishwasher and get it back up and running again in no time.
