## Troubleshooting Basics for the Most Common Washing Machine Fault

We all know going weeks on end without a working washing machine can seem like an eternity, so it's important to know the basics of troubleshooting the most common fault in order to get your laundry back up and running. Whether you're searching for the cause of a leaking washer, loud noises, or other common household appliances issues, there are some useful tips and tricks to attempt when it comes to fixing your washing machine at home.

The most common fault on a washing machine is leaking. A leaking washing machine may be caused by a variety of different things, from a split hose, to a faulty lid switch. Before calling a repairman and spending a fortune, it's best to attempt to diagnose and fix the problem at home. 

First, you should check the hoses connected to the washer. Hoses may split or a connection may become loose over years of wear and tear. If a leak starts suddenly, check the hoses to ensure they're tight and undamaged. If they are, the source of the leak may be something else. 

The second most culprit of a leaking washer is a faulty lid switch. The lid switch is an internal part located behind the front panel of the washing machine and it tells the appliance when the door is opened or shut. If this part is broken or corroded, water may leak when the machine is in use. 

If you suspect a problem with the lid switch, it's best to contact a professional for repair or replacement. Doing so will help prevent any severe damage from occurring to the washer and ensure that the machine continues to efficiently wash your clothes.

It's important to remember that many common faults in your washing machine can be fixed at home with some basic knowledge and troubleshooting skills. But if the problem persists, it's best you contact the experts for help in order to prevent any further damage and to get your machine up and running. Before investing in a repairman, get the best advice and tips you can when it comes to troubleshooting the most common fault on a washing machine.
