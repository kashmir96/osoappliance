If your oven isn't heating up, it can be a frustrating experience. Whether you're trying to cook a delicious meal or just warm up leftovers, it can be a major inconvenience when your oven won't heat up. Before you make a costly repair call, there are several things you can do to try and troubleshoot the problem.

First, check to make sure the oven is plugged in and the circuit breaker hasnâ€™t been tripped. If these are not the issue, then it may be time to inspect the heating elements. Ovens have two heating elements: one on top and one on bottom. Unplug your oven before inspecting the elements. Look for any signs of damage like cracks or breaks in the coils. If you find any damage, replace the element immediately. 

If your heating elements look fine, then it's time to check your thermostat and temperature sensor. The thermostat controls how hot your oven gets while the temperature sensor measures how hot it is inside the oven. Make sure both are properly connected and in working order. If they appear to be faulty, you may need to replace them with new parts. 

Finally, if all else fails, it's time to call in a professional repairman to take a look at your oven. Be sure to tell them exactly what steps you've taken so far so they can quickly identify and fix the problem for you. 

By following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot why your oven isn't heating up and get back to cooking delicious meals in no time!
