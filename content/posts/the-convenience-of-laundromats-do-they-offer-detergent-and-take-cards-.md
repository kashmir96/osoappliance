Laundromats are a great way to take care of your laundry needs. They provide convenience and affordability, plus they offer a variety of services. But one question many people have is whether or not laundromats offer detergent and accept credit cards. The answer to both of these questions is yes!

Most laundromats will provide detergent for you to use in their machines at an additional fee. This makes it easy for you to keep your clothes clean without having to purchase and carry around heavy containers of detergent. Many laundromats also offer other items such as fabric softener, stain remover, and bleach, so you can get everything you need all in one place. 

The majority of laundromats now accept credit card payments as well which makes it even more convenient for customers who don’t want to be carrying cash around with them while doing laundry. This also allows customers the flexibility to pay with whatever method they prefer without having to worry about having enough cash on hand when they visit the laundromat. 

All in all, using a laundromat is both a convenient and affordable option when it comes time for doing laundry. Not only do most places offer detergent at an extra fee but they also accept credit cards which make payment quick and easy! So if you’re looking for a place where you can take care of all your laundry needs without breaking the bank then look no further than your local laundromat!
