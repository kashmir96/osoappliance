When it comes to doing your laundry, one of the most important decisions you have to make is which dryer setting to use. Depending on the type of fabric you are drying and the desired outcome, different settings are necessary. Here are a few tips on what dryer setting should you use for different types of fabric:

1. Delicates: For delicate items such as lingerie, silk and wool garments, choose the delicate cycle or low heat setting. This will help protect these fabrics from shrinkage, wrinkling and fading. 

2. Cotton & Linen: For items made of cotton or linen like sheets and towels, select the regular cycle with medium heat. This will help keep them looking new for longer and prevent them from shrinking or becoming misshapen over time. 

3. Synthetics: For synthetic fabrics such as polyester and nylon, opt for a low-heat setting as these materials can be easily damaged by high temperatures. This will also help reduce static cling and wrinkles in the fabric. 

4. Heavy Duty Items: If youâ€™re drying heavy duty items like jeans or canvas bags, choose the permanent press cycle with high heat setting to ensure all moisture is removed from them completely without causing any damage to their fibers or colors. 

By following these tips on what dryer setting should you use for each type of fabric when doing your laundry, you can ensure that your clothes remain looking their best for longer periods of time!
