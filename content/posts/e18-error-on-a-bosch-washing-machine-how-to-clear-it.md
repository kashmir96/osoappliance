## Clearing an E18 Error on a Bosch Washing Machine

When an E18 Error appears on a Bosch washing machine, it indicates a water drainage issue. This issue can be caused by blockage, clogs, or a malfunction of the drain pump. Fear not; if you encounter this error, there are a few steps you can take to try to clear it.

First, unplug the washing machine from the wall, and check the drain hose for any blockage or kinks, which could be causing the pump to struggle with removing the water from the washing machine. Make sure that the hose is connected and not obstructed. Then, try running the drain cycle or emptying the water manually. This should clear the error.

Another possible cause of an E18 error is a loose wire or fault in the wiring. To check for this, remove the back panel of the machine, and check for loose wiring. If you find any, reseat the wires and try again.

The last resort should be to ensure that the drain pump is operating correctly. To do this one will need to access and clean the pump filter, which sits at the bottom of the machine and is where the drain hose is connected. Removal may require some specialized tools, so it is recommended to seek professional help before attempting.

In the event that no blockages or wiring faults are found, and cleaning the pump filter doesnâ€™t work, the last option is to replace the pump itself.

If you experience an E18 error code on your Bosch washing machine, before you take it into a repair shop, take the time to look for blockages, check the wiring, and clean the pump filter. With luck, one of these three steps will clear the error for you. For more information about E18 or other appliance error codes, check out our Comprehensive Appliance Error Code Glossary.
