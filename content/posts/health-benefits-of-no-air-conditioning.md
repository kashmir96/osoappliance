With the summer months quickly approaching, many of us start to think about cranking up the air conditioning and seeking out those cool spots. But did you know that air conditioning can be bad for your health? By foregoing air conditioning in your home or workplace, you can actually benefit from improved physical and mental health.

First of all, no air conditioning means more fresh air. Without the artificial cooling of an AC unit, natural ventilation can take place which brings in a steady stream of fresh cold air into your home or office. This will help improve air quality and reduce dust particles in the atmosphere which can cause respiratory issues like asthma attacks.

In addition to providing better quality of the indoor atmosphere, no AC also encourages better sleep patterns. With natural temperatures rising during the day and dropping at night, our body’s circadian rhythms are better attuned to that pattern than with artificial temperature control. That said, a cooler room temperature is still recommended for restful sleep - so open some windows to let in some cool night breezes! 

Another advantage is exercise: without access to an AC machine blowing cold air through your home or office space during hot days, you'll likely find yourself moving around more often in search of cool places or doing activities that promote cooling such as swimming or taking walks outside during cooler hours. This type of movement and exercise will help improve overall physical fitness levels as well as mental wellbeing by getting those endorphins flowing! 
 
Finally - although it may seem counterintuitive - no AC actually helps lower electricity bills too! Air conditioners consume a large amount of energy and cost a lot over time - so if you opt out this summer you’ll be saving yourself money while still staying comfortable with natural ventilation methods such as fans and windows instead. 
 
Overall then, foregoing an AC unit this summer could prove not only beneficial for your wallet but also for your health - both mentally & physically! So instead of reaching for that remote control switch why not try some natural cooling methods first?
