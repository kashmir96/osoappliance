##Running a Diagnostic on Your Washing Machine

Are you experiencing issues such as a spinning problem or not draining properly in your washing machine? If you're having trouble with your laundry appliance, running a diagnostic check is a great way to narrow down the problem and troubleshoot it quickly. This article will explain how to run a diagnostic test on your washing machine to get it running like new in no time!

The first step in running a diagnostic check on your washer is to unplug it from the wall and turn off the water supply. This ensures that no damage occurs to the unit as you troubleshoot. After doing so, open the top lid and locate the service panel on the back of the washer. On the service panel, you should find a few buttons that need to be pressed to run the diagnostic test. If you’re not sure which buttons to press, consult the manual that came with the unit to find the correct ones.

Once the button has been pressed, the diagnostic test will run. The machine should display a series of codes that indicate what’s wrong. Depending on the type of washer you have, the codes may vary. If the codes do not make sense to you, refer to the instruction manual or contact customer service to get a definitive answer.

If the diagnostic test determines that there is an issue with the unit, you will be able to determine which part needs repair or replacement. For example, in many cases, a faulty belt in the washing machine may be responsible for poor functioning. Replacing the belt is relatively easy to do and should solve the problem you’re having with your unit.

By taking the time to run a diagnostic on your washing machine, you can save yourself time, money and headaches by pinpointing the exact issue that’s causing the poor performance of your appliance.
