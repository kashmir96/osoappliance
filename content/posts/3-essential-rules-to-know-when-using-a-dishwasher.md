## Knowing the Basics of Dishwasher Usage
Utilizing a dishwasher is a simple process however there are certain practices to make the most of your appliance and ensure you get the best results. In this blog, we'll discuss the three essential rules to keep in mind when using a dishwasher.

### Scrape or Rinse Dishes
Before loading the dishwasher, it is important to take the time to scrape off any large pieces of food that may be stuck on the dishes. Allowing large pieces of food to enter the dishwasher can actually clog the filters resulting in an error code. It is also beneficial to rinse dishes with running water. This ensures dirt and food particles are rinsed off before entering the dishwasher. 

### Load the Dishwasher Properly
The way you load the dishwasher can have a big impact on the cleansing results of the appliance. It is important to separate items by size, limiting the amount of flatware in the utensil basket. Sufficiently spread out dishes and glasses and ensure they are not stuffed in tightly. In addition, you should also take the time to make sure the rotating arms can freely rotate. 

### Use the Right Soap
It is essential to select the right type of soap for your dishwasher. There are two main types of dishwasher detergent: powder and tablets. Tablets are generally easier to use but the powder detergents can be more effective at harder-to-clean pots and pans. It is also important to follow the instructions of the soap that you select to ensure optimal results. 

Following these three essential rules when using a dishwasher can help to improve the cleaning ability and longevity of the appliance. If you do run into any issues with your dishwasher, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) can help provide additional assistance.
