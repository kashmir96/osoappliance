Air purifiers are a great way to clean the air in your home and keep it free of dust, pollen, pet dander, and other airborne pollutants. But like any appliance, air purifiers need to be regularly maintained in order to work properly. This maintenance includes replacing certain parts when they become worn or damaged. Knowing which parts you need to replace and when can help you get the most out of your air purifier and keep the air quality in your home clean and healthy.

The most common parts that will need replacing are the filters. Most air purifiers use a combination of pre-filters, HEPA filters, and carbon filters to capture airborne pollutants. The pre-filter is typically made from a mesh material that helps capture larger particles like dust and pet hair before they reach the other more delicate filters. The HEPA filter is made from a fine fiberglass material that captures smaller particles like pollen or mold spores. And finally, the carbon filter removes VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from the air for improved indoor air quality. 

Replacing these filters on a regular basis is important to maintain peak performance from your air purifier; if they become clogged with particles they can’t effectively clean the air anymore. Most manufacturers recommend replacing these types of filters every 3-6 months depending on usage level; if you’re running your unit all day long it may be necessary to replace them more often than once every 6 months! Additionally, checking each type of filter periodically can help you identify when it needs replacement; if it looks stained or has visible dust buildup then it’s likely time for a new one! 

In addition to these main types of filters there are some other components which may also require periodic replacement including UV lamps (if equipped), fan blades/motors, gaskets/seals between sections of the unit (to ensure proper airflow), as well as any related electrical components such as wiring connectors or circuit boards which can fail over time due to wear & tear on them from normal operation of your unit. 

Overall taking care of our indoor breathing environment starts with keeping our appliances well maintained by regularly checking for needed replacements parts & making sure everything is functioning properly so it can continue doing its job!
