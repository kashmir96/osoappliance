## Get Professional Results with Natural Cleaners 

Making sure your kitchen appliances are regularly cleaned and well-maintained is key to preserving their longevity. Fortunately, cleaning household appliances can be done in a natural and cost-effective way. With just a few natural cleaning supplies, you can keep your oven, fridge, microwave, and more looking good as new. 

When it comes to cleaning ovens and ranges, baking soda and white vinegar make a great team. Start by making a paste with baking soda and water. Spread the paste all over the inside of the oven and leave it for at least 12 hours, overnight is even better. During this time, the baking soda will break up grease and grime. The next day, use a damp cloth to wipe away the paste, and finish by cleaning the surface with a vinegar-water solution. 

Cleaning microwaves is a bit more straightforward. Start by wiping out the moisture and splatters from the surface with a damp cloth. To remove any stubborn stains, mix equal parts of water and vinegar in a bowl to create a cleaning solution. Put the bowl of solution in the microwave and heat it up on high for one minute. Let the microwaves steam de-gunk the interior and use the cloth to wipe it clean.

Refrigerators require a little extra effort and require special attention, particularly the seals and door handle. To start, make sure to clean any spills or sticky spots with a baking soda and water paste. Wipe off the surface with a damp cloth and affix a piece of sponge to the handle, as this helps prevent smudges and fingerprints. Lastly, wipe down the seals and handles with a vinegar-water solution.
