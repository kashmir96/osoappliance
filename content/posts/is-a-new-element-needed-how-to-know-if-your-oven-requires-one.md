## Identifying When Your Oven Element Needs Replacing
Oven elements are a central part of your oven, allowing it to reach and maintain the desired temperatures for your cooking. Without functioning elements your oven may not reach the required temperatures for proper cooking, leading to spoiled food, and in some cases potential fires and injury. Knowing when an element needs replacing is essential to keeping your oven safe and efficient.

If your oven is not reaching the desired temperature and has been properly pre-heated, it can be a sign that an element needs replacing. Similarly, if the oven is unable to maintain temperature stability over a long period of time, or is displaying uneven heating, then a new element is likely necessary. Another common sign is a heating element that is visibly cracked, burned or corroded – usually resulting from the element overheating. 


Another way to test whether your oven requires a new element is to take a multimeter and test the resistance of the element. If the readings are lower than it should be or does not stabilize, then the element needs to be replaced. However, if you are not comfortable taking on this step yourself, it is advised to contact a professional who will be able to accurately assess and diagnose the issue.

In summary, it is essential to identify when your oven element needs replacing to ensure its safe and efficient functioning.

If you are unable to do this yourself or are unsure, contacting a professional for assistance is advised.
