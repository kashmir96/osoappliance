## Solving Issues with a Broken Washing Machine Door Lock
Have you ever been locked out of your washing machine mid-cycle? It’s a frustrating experience but it doesn’t have to mean the end of your washing machine. Many fixes are simpler than you may think.

The most common fault in a broken washing machine door lock is a blocked drainage hose. This can prevent the door from closing properly and causing the washing machine to lock. This can be quickly solved by unblocking the drainage hose. Once the hose is cleared, your washing machine door should open and close as normal.

If the drainage hose is clear, and the washing machine is still locking, the fault may lie with the door lock itself. This can either be malfunctioning or simply worn out. Most door locks have a few basic components that can become worn over time and cause the door to lock.

One of the first things you should check is the wiring. If the wiring is not connected properly, the door may not be able to open and close properly and cause it to lock. To fix this, you will want to check all the wiring connections and make sure they are properly connected.

If the wiring is all in order, the fault may lie with a broken latch. Over time, the latch can become worn and stop the door from opening and closing properly. The best way to diagnose this issue is to remove the latch, inspect for any signs of wear or damage, and replace it if necessary. 

If the latch is in good condition and the door still locks, then the fault may be with the motor. If the motor has worn out or failed, it will not be able to unlock the door. The wiring that feeds power to the motor may also need to be checked. Depending on the severity of the fault, you may need to call a professional repair technician who will be able to diagnose and repair the issue.

If your washing machine door lock is broken, you don’t need to worry. With a few simple troubleshooting steps, you will be able to diagnose the fault and make the necessary repairs.
