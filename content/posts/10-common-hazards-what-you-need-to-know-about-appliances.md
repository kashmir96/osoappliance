With the prevalence of household appliances in our day-to-day lives, it's important to be aware of the potential for hazards. Knowing about common appliance hazards can help you be better prepared to keep your home safe. Here are 10 common hazards that you should be aware of when it comes to appliances.

1. Fire Hazards – Faulty wiring or short circuits can cause fires in any appliance. Be sure to inspect all cords and plugs regularly to ensure everything is in good working order.

2. Electrical Shocks – Taking extra care around any appliance using live electricity can help prevent potential shocks. Never touch any appliance when your hands are wet, and unplug the appliance if you’re working on it in any way.

3. Combustion Hazards – Gas-powered appliances can emit dangerous levels of carbon monoxide and other combustible gasses if not properly used and maintained. Take precautions to use these items in well-ventilated areas and to properly inspect and service them whenever necessary.

5. Entrapment Hazards – Openings such as those found in washing machines and dishwashers can create a risk of entrapment. Pay attention to the size and weight of items you add to these appliances to avoid any potential danger.

6. Excessive Noise – Loud electric drills or vacuums can cause hearing damage. Wear ear protection when working around large or loud appliances.

7. Slip and Fall Hazards – Mopping and vacuuming can create a slippery surface. Wipe the area dry after using these items to avoid any potential falls.

8. Burns – Hot surfaces, such as a stovetop, can cause burns if touched without proper protection. Always use a pot holder or oven mitt when touching any hot surfaces.

9. Fragile Materials – Some materials can easily break or break easily due to heat, pressure or age. Take care when cleaning or working on any fragile appliances to avoid accidental breakage.
