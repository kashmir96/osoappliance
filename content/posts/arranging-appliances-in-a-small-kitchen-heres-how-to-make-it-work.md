## Making the Most Out of a Small Kitchen
For many of us, our kitchens are the focal point of our homes. With small spaces, you can easily make the most of limited room with the right appliances and layout. Here are some tips on how to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing kitchen without worrying about space constraints. 

When looking to populate your kitchen with appliances, be selective. Instead of trying to fit as much as possible, pick only what is necessary. Choose a few key items that will make food preparation, storage and serving easier. Consider items like a powerful blender, air fryer, microwave, and/or multi-cooker. 

In addition to choosing the right appliances, the placement also needs to be considered. Measure the dimensions of each device for the perfect fit. For example, place the microwave or convection oven above the stove for piece of mind and easy access. Refrigerators and freezers can stand up to 16-inches from the wall and are typically located in the busiest area of the kitchen. 

If counter space is limited and you need additional storage, consider adding a wall-mounted shelf or hang cooking utensils, pots, pans and other items on the walls. Alternatively, you can opt for a mobile cart for flexible convenience. Place it on one side of the kitchen for quick snacks or in the center for a spot for blended drinks and meal prep. 

Creating a small kitchen that works can be fun and creative. With the right selection of appliances and creative placement of them, you great a functional and inviting space.
