## Get the Most Out of Recycling an AC Unit
When it's time to replace an air conditioning (AC) unit and you’re getting a newer model, it’s important to know how to get the most out of the recycling process. Air conditioning units are made of a variety of materials that can be recycled, or that might contain toxic chemicals that need to be safely disposed of, so it’s important to do your part to protect the environment while you replace or update your home AC unit.

The first step to scrap an AC unit is to determine the type of unit it is. There are central air conditioners, window unit air conditioners, and split systems with an outdoor and an indoor unit. Knowing what type you have will help you determine which parts are recyclable.

Once you know the type of AC unit you have and the parts that can be recycled, you’ll need to assess the condition of the unit. If you have a newer appliance that’s in good condition, you may be able to recycle the entire AC unit and make a little money. The recycling center will be able to give you a quote on the spot.

For AC units that are in less than perfect condition, you’ll need to do a little extra work to scrap the appliance. Remove all the components of the unit, including the coolant or refrigerant, as these may contain harmful chemicals. Refrigerants must be taken to a certified technician to be disposed of safely.

If you’re still unsure of how to properly recycle or scrap your AC unit, it’s a good idea to contact a reputable local appliance service technician. Hiring an experienced repair technician to help you safely scrap your AC unit can give you the peace of mind that you’re doing the right thing.

By recycling your AC unit or scrapping it responsibly, you can play your part to protect the environment. Recycling helps to reduce waste and ensures that the parts of your AC unit are reused in other products. Plus, with the help of a professional repair technician, you can be sure that your appliance is getting recycled properly.
