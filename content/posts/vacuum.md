## Revitalize Your Vacuum Cleaner with Proper Maintenance

Keeping your vacuum cleaner in tip-top condition is essential for ensuring that your home is kept clean. But over time, a vacuum cleaner can start to lose its efficiency if it isn't well-maintained. For Electrolux vacuums in particular, restoring them to like-new condition requires basic maintenance and routine cleanings.

For starters, be sure to empty the dust compartment regularly, especially when it's already full or close to full. Ice buildup and dust buildup can also impede a vacuum cleaner's efficiency, so make sure to clean the inside of the dust compartment before you put it back in the vacuum. Additionally, check for worn or stretched hoses, bags, filters, and other parts and make sure to replace these components as needed.

Next, clean the roller brush by removing it from the vacuum and rubbing it with a soft brush or rag to get rid of dust, hair, and any other particles. To finish off, lubricate the roller brush with a special vacuum lubricant to reduce friction and help it spin properly. When reinstalling the roller brush, make sure the bristles fit snugly into the vacuum housing.

When cleaning the outside of your Electrolux vacuum, use a soft cloth to wipe down the exterior and be sure to rinse out the filter at least once a month. If your vacuum has a “powerhead,” make sure to remove the belt and check for signs of wear and tear.

Finally, it’s important to analyze how much power your vacuum consumes when running. If it seems difficult to push and drag around the house, it’s likely because the motor needs to be replaced. Your local appliance repair technicians can help with this - but it’s easy to resurrect your Electrolux vacuum with just a few simple fixes.

With just a few simple steps, it’s easy and simple to keep your Electrolux vacuum up and running like new. If you have any questions and need additional guidance, our directory of appliance repair technicians is here to help. Find your local technician and get repairs done on your schedule.
