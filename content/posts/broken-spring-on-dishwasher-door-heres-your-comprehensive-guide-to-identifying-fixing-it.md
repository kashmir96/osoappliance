## Identifying & Fixing a Broken Spring on a Dishwasher Door

Every household has a dishwasher, and if you’ve recently noticed that your dishwasher door is not closing properly and the spring seems broken, don’t worry. This type of repair is more common than you may think. In this blog post, we’ll provide a comprehensive guide to identifying and fixing a broken spring on a dishwasher door. 

The first step to repairing a broken spring on a dishwasher door is to identify how the spring works. The dishwasher door is attached to the cabinet, and the spring is installed to the side of the cabinet and door assembly to provide tension and helps the door to close and stay closed. When the door touches the cabinet frame, the spring contracts, allowing the door to stay closed firmly. The spring is designed to hold the door’s weight, but if it wears out, the dishwasher door won’t stay closed and can suddenly open unexpectedly.

The next step to fixing a broken spring is to remove the old spring and replace it with a new one. To do this, you’ll need a set of vice grips, screwdriver, and a new spring. Start by removing the old spring from the cabinet, unscrewing the screws that hold it in place. Once the old spring is removed, inspect it and check for signs of damage or excessive wear. If the spring is still intact, you can try to re-install it, but it’s likely that it won’t hold the way the new spring will. 

Now that you’ve identified the issue and removed the old spring, it’s time to replace it with a new one. Place the new spring in the same spot as the old one and screw it in place with the same screws, making sure that the spring is secure. You should also make sure that the tension of the new spring is correct, so that the door will close securely.

Once the new spring is installed and you’ve double checked that the tension is correct, you can test the door. Push the door closed without forcing it, and the door should hold securely in place. If your dishwasher door closes as it should, then you’ve successfully identified and repaired the broken spring.

Identifying and fixing a broken spring on a dishwasher door is a relatively easy fix for most homeowners.
