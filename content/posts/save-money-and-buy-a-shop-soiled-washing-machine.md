## Save Money with a Shop Soiled Washing Machine
If you're looking for an affordable way to upgrade your washing machine, buying a 'Shop Soiled' appliance could be the perfect solution. These items have superficial defects which do not impact their day to day performance, and they are often available at a greatly discounted rate.

Shop Soiled appliances are generally returned to the manufacturer following a customer’s decision to reject them, however, the item has been inspected and deemed to still be in working order. While a Shop Soiled washing machine has aftercare benefits such as a product warranty, the main advantage of this route is the saving. 

The significant cut in price that a shopper receives when purchasing a Shop Soiled model is often enough to allow them to treat themselves to a higher grade model compared to an item which is unsoiled. In addition to this, due to many larger retailers offering Shop Soiled models for sale, it’s easy for the consumer to compare prices and assess the savings available.

When purchasing a Shop Soiled appliance, some practical considerations should be taken into account. Firstly, it’s important to fully understand the type and severity of any defects. These could range from scratches, scrapes, dents, and discoloration, however, normal wear and tear of functional components such as the door seal, drum and tubing won’t be included. 

In the long-term, this can help to save costs due to the product’s reduced price. Furthermore, should any kind of damage or fault occur, then repair and maintenance will be covered by the original warranty agreement. Whether buying a ‘Shop Soiled’ washing machine or any other appliance for that matter, users should always keep in mind that the product comes with a comprehensive aftercare package.

Overall, purchasing a Shop Soiled washing machine can be a great way to make a considerable saving on a new appliance.
