Stove top stuffing is a popular Thanksgiving side dish, but it's recently been banned in some places. The reason for this ban is due to a potential health risk. Stove top stuffing contains a chemical called propylene glycol, which is a preservative that has been linked to health problems such as cancer, liver damage, and kidney issues. In some places, propylene glycol is banned or limited in food products. 

In addition to the potential health risks, the preservative can also cause food spoilage. This can lead to food poisoning, which can be dangerous and even fatal in some cases. For these reasons, many places have chosen to ban Stove top stuffing to protect consumers from potential health risks. 

It's important to note that the ban on Stove top stuffing does not apply to all products containing the preservative. Many companies use propylene glycol in their products in small amounts and are still allowed to sell them. However, it's important to be aware of what you're buying and to check the ingredients list before buying a product. 

Overall, the ban on Stove top stuffing is in place to protect consumers from potential health risks. While it may be disappointing for some people, it's important to remember that the ban is in place for a good reason.
