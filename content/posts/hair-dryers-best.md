If you’re like most people, you probably use a hair dryer on a regular basis. While hair dryers can be incredibly helpful in styling your hair, they can also cause damage if not used properly. To keep your hair looking healthy and beautiful, here are some of the best practices for using a hair dryer.

1. Use the Correct Heat Setting: Many people make the mistake of using too much heat when drying their hair. This can cause serious damage to your locks, so it’s important to use the correct setting for your hair type. If you have fine or damaged hair, use the lowest heat setting possible. For thick or coarse hair, you may need to increase the heat slightly.

2. Invest in Quality: When it comes to choosing a hair dryer, quality is key. Investing in a high-quality dryer will ensure that your hair is getting the best care possible and will prevent damage from occurring due to overheating or over drying. Look for models with adjustable temperature settings and ceramic or tourmaline technology for optimal results.

3. Use a Heat Protectant: To further protect your locks from heat damage, always use a thermal protectant spray before drying your hair. This will help create a barrier between your strands and the hot air of the dryer, preventing them from becoming overly dried out or damaged in the process.

4. Don’t Over Dry: Once you’ve finished styling your locks, turn off the dryer and allow them to finish air drying on their own if possible. Over drying can lead to split ends and breakage, so it’s important to avoid this step whenever possible! 

5. Take Breaks: Lastly, be sure to give yourself breaks in between uses of your hair dryer! Allowing your tresses some time away from hot air will help keep them looking healthy and strong over time! 

Following these simple tips will help ensure that you get the most out of your blow-drying sessions without causing any unnecessary damage!
