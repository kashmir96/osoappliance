## Uncovering the Solution of 6e Error Code in an LG Dishwasher
It can be both stressful and inconvenient to discover that your appliance is not working. Your first instinct may be to immediately call a repair service, or to see if you can figure out what the issue may be first. To help you identify the issue and correct it, finding and understanding error codes can be a helpful starting point.

If you have an LG dishwasher displaying the error code 6e, you may be worried about what could be causing the issue, or how you can fix it. The 6e code indicates a problem with draining water from the dishwasher, so that is the area you will want to focus on. This article will provide further explanation and details on what may be causing the 6e error code in an LG dishwasher, and how you can solve the issue.

First you should check to make sure the drain hose is not kinked or clogged. If it is, straighten it out and clean out any clogs, such as by using a wire or pipe cleaner. If this did not solve the issue, check to make sure the water supply line is open. The supply line shut off valve should be ‘on’ and not blocked by any foreign objects, including dirt or food. While checking the line, take a look at the filter to ensure it is clean.

If those solutions still don’t fix the 6e error issue, the issue may be within your dishwasher’s control board. If you are uncomfortable taking off the control board yourself and testing it, you may want to consider calling a repairman for assistance. Faulty wiring or a loose wiring connection may be the cause, so it would be best to have a licensed service technician check it out.

In summation, the error code 6e in an LG dishwasher can be caused by a clogged or kinked drain hose, a blocked water supply line, or a faulty control board. Make sure the drain hose is not clogged or kinked and that the water line is on and not blocked, and if the issue persists, contact a repairman.
