As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, many people are taking extra precautions to protect their health and safety. One of the most popular steps is to invest in an air purifier that can help reduce the airborne particles that carry the virus. Air purifiers are designed to remove pollutants, allergens, and other airborne contaminants from a room or space. With so many air purifiers on the market, it can be difficult to know which one is right for you and your family’s needs. 

When looking for an air purifier to use against COVID-19, it’s important to consider the size of your room or space and what type of filter is best suited for capturing airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2. HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters are one of the most effective types of filters for capturing small particles like viruses and bacteria. They have been certified by The National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) as being able to capture 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns or larger in size – including those carrying COVID-19 – making them ideal for use in homes, offices and other enclosed spaces where people spend most of their time indoors. 

Another important factor when selecting an air purifier is the type of fan used within it; a more powerful fan will be able to move more air through its filter system faster than a weaker fan. This means that with a higher powered fan you will get better results in terms of removing virus particles from the air faster than with a weaker fan design. It’s also essential that your chosen model has an effective filtration system; typically this includes either HEPA or activated carbon filtration technology combined with either pre-filters or ultra fine particle filters depending on which type you select as mentioned before; these systems create multiple levels within which unwanted particles are captured before they enter into your breathing zone inside a room or space making them highly effective at reducing risk from contagion while occupying indoor areas over extended periods such as during long work shifts at home etc… 

Finally consider how much noise each model produces; some models with powerful fans may produce more noise than others so if this is something that may affect how you operate then consider selecting quieter models available on today’s market since noise can be distracting when trying to work productively indoors etc… Models outfitted with sleep mode settings usually reduce sound levels during nighttime hours providing added convenience without having to manually adjust settings every day etc… 

Overall investing in quality HEPA/activated carbon filter equipped air purifier systems provides greater peace of mind when occupying indoor spaces over extended periods by effectively reducing risk from airborne viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 carrying COVID-19 infection potential making them highly recommended investments amidst current pandemic conditions worldwide!
