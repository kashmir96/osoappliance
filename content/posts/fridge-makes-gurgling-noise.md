A gurgling sound coming from your refrigerator can be incredibly annoying and disruptive. Fortunately, there are a few things you can try yourself before calling in a repair serviceman.

First and foremost, if you notice any leaking or water pooling near the refrigerator, shut off the water supply to it immediately. This is likely a sign of a clogged drain line or some other issue that needs to be addressed immediately.

If there’s no water leakage, check to make sure the condenser coils on the back of the fridge are free from dust and dirt buildup. When these become too clogged up with debris, it can impede airflow and cause strange noises like gurgling to come from your refrigerator. Use a vacuum cleaner with an extended hose attachment to clean off any dust or dirt that might have accumulated on these coils.

Another thing you should check is your fridge’s temperature settings; if they’re set too high it could cause excess condensation inside which could also lead to gurgling sounds coming from the fridge. Make sure your freezer is set at 0 degrees Fahrenheit and that your refrigerator isn’t set above 40 degrees Fahrenheit - anything above this range could result in too much condensation inside the appliance which then leads to gurgling noises as well as potentially damaging food stored inside of it due to excessive moisture levels present within its interior walls. 
 
Finally, examine all of your refrigerator's seals - especially around its door - for any tears or damage that might be allowing cold air out while warm air gets in; this will result in additional condensation forming within its walls resulting in those frustrating gurgles as well as potential food spoilage due to excessive moisture buildup within its interior walls over time if left unchecked for long periods of time. 

 
If none of these steps seem able solve the problem with your fridge's gurgling noise then it's probably time for you call an experienced repair serviceman who has had experience working with refrigerators before - they will have better troubleshooting abilities than most home owners do when dealing with this kind of issue so they should be able to pinpoint exactly what needs fixing faster than trying anything else yourself would likely achieve!
