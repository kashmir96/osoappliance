## An Overview of Electric Oven Power Requirements 
When you purchase an electric oven, you likely have questions about how much power the appliance will use. Ovens may be powered by electric, natural gas, or other fuel sources, so it's important to understand the power requirements of your appliance. Here we provide an overview of the power requirements of electric ovens, from wattage to energy consumption. 

An electric oven typically consumes around 2,000 to 5,000 watts of power. Smaller, countertop ovens usually require around 1,200 watts, while larger, built-in ovens may require up to 5,000 watts. The exact wattage will vary significantly depending on the type and size of the oven. 

When it comes to energy consumption, electric ovens typically have an energy consumption rating of 1.5 to 2.5 kWh per hour. For example, a 2,000 watt oven with a two-hour cooking cycle would consume 4 kWh of electricity. This amount can vary significantly depending on the settings and the type of dish being cooked. 

Electric ovens are relatively efficient, and the amount of heat they generate is significantly higher than other fuel sources. The efficiency of an electric oven is typically around 70%, meaning that 70% of the energy generated is transferred to the food being cooked, while the other 30% is lost as heat. 

Keep in mind that it's important to regularly inspect and maintain your electric oven to ensure it is operating efficiently. This can include checking the coils and heating elements for wear and damage, cleaning and maintaining the interior, and checking the wiring and connections for any malfunction or damage. 

So the next time you purchase or use an electric oven, make sure that you understand the power requirements and energy consumption. By doing so, you can maximize the efficiency and performance of your oven.
