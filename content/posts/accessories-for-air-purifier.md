Air purifiers are a great addition to any home, helping to clean the air and make it more comfortable for everyone in the house. But what about accessories for air purifiers? There are a number of options available to help customize your air purifier and make it even more effective at cleaning the air. 

First, an activated carbon filter is a great accessory for an air purifier. The carbon absorbs odors from the air, which can improve indoor air quality. However, you'll need to replace this filter every six months or so depending on usage. 

Next, HEPA filters are another popular option for improving indoor air quality. These filters will capture small particles like dust and pollen out of the atmosphere before they can circulate through your home, helping keep your home’s atmosphere allergen-free. Again these need to be replaced regularly depending on usage. 

Another great option is an ionizer attachment that helps remove smoke particles and other pollutants from the environment by producing negative ions that attach themselves to pollutants in order to neutralize them before they can enter your lungs or other parts of your home’s interior space. 

Finally, UV lights are also good accessories as they will disinfect incoming airflow by eliminating airborne bacteria and viruses that could be lingering in the atmosphere surrounding you and your family members within your household walls. This is especially beneficial if someone in the house has allergies or asthma since these conditions can be worsened by allergens present in dirty indoor atmospheres. 

 All these accessories can help create a cleaner environment within any household space with an added layer of defense against germs and allergens alike!
