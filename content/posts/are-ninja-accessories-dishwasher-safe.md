Are you a fan of ninja accessories, such as throwing stars or nunchucks? You may be wondering if these items are safe to put in the dishwasher. The short answer is no, Ninja accessories are not dishwasher safe. 

Ninja accessories are typically made of metal and can become damaged in a dishwasher. The high temperatures and harsh detergents used to clean dishes could cause the metal to corrode, weaken or discolor over time. The hot water could also cause the metal to expand, making it difficult for the item to fit back together properly after washing. Additionally, the spinning motion of a dishwasher can cause sharp objects like throwing stars and nunchucks to become loose and potentially dangerous. 

For these reasons, it’s best not to put your Ninja accessories in the dishwasher. Instead, hand wash them with mild soap and warm water using a soft cloth or sponge. Make sure you dry them completely before storing them away so they don’t rust or corrode over time. 

When it comes to cleaning Ninja accessories, safety should always come first!
