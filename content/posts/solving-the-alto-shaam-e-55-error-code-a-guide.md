## Troubleshooting the E 55 Error Code on Alto Shaam Appliances 
If you've encountered error code E 55 and you have an Alto Shaam appliance, chances are you're looking for some guidance. This article is here to answer your questions and provide the information needed to help you resolve the issue.

The E 55 code relates to malfunctioning power boards on Alto Shaam appliances. This error is connected to the appliance's temperature control system and indicates that the temperature limit sensor has exceeded its high temperature setting. The exact cause for this issue varies but is generally either related to the appliance's power board needing to be replaced or a wiring issue with the sensor itself.

If you are familiar with repairing appliance components, the first step would be to inspect the W1 terminals on the appliance's power board. If this inspection shows any damage or irregularities, replace the power board.

If the power board is in good condition, then you may need to troubleshoot the temperature limit sensor. This requires disconnecting the power and disassembling the appliance to gain access to the thermistor. Use a multimeter to test the sensor's resistance and make sure it is continuous. If not, the wiring is most likely the cause of the problem and will require a professional to repair or replace the wiring.

Finally, if there appears to be nothing wrong with the power board or thermistor, then contact the manufacturer's customer service line. The Alto Shaam team should be able to determine root cause and provide support and guidance to resolve the issue.
