Perm press is a setting on your dryer that is designed to care for permanent press items. Permanent press fabrics are treated with a special finish that helps them keep their shape and resist wrinkles. The perm press setting on your dryer is designed to provide a gentler drying cycle that won't damage the fabric finish.

When using the perm press setting, your dryer will use a lower temperature and a longer cycle to dry your items. This helps to ensure that the fabric finish is not damaged by the heat of the dryer. The perm press setting also helps to reduce wrinkling by tumbling the items for a longer period of time.

It's important to note that the perm press setting should only be used for permanent press items. If you try to dry other fabrics with the perm press setting, they may shrink or be damaged by the heat. It's also important to read the care label on your items before using the perm press setting. Some items may require a different setting or a different cycle.

Using the perm press setting on your dryer can help you care for your permanent press items and keep them looking like new. It's a great way to ensure that your clothes look their best and last as long as possible.
