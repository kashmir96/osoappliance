If you’ve noticed that your dishwasher is always draining, it’s likely due to a few different issues. The most common causes are clogged drains, a faulty drain pump, or a faulty float switch. 

Clogged drains are the most common cause of a dishwasher always draining. This can happen when food particles and grease build up in the dishwasher’s drain hose and prevent water from flowing through. To fix this, you’ll need to clean out the drain hose and check for any blockages.

A faulty drain pump can also be the cause of your dishwasher always draining. The drain pump is responsible for pumping out the water from the dishwasher and if it’s not working properly, the dishwasher will continue to drain. To fix this, you’ll need to replace the drain pump.

Finally, a faulty float switch can also be the cause of your dishwasher always draining. The float switch is responsible for detecting when the water level in the dishwasher is too high and shutting off the water supply. If the float switch isn’t working properly, the dishwasher will continue to drain. To fix this, you’ll need to replace the float switch.

If you’ve noticed that your dishwasher is always draining, it’s important to identify the cause and take action to fix it. Clogged drains, a faulty drain pump, or a faulty float switch are the most common causes of a dishwasher always draining. With the right diagnosis and repair, you can get your dishwasher back to working properly in no time.
