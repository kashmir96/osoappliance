Cleaning your stove top is a chore that no one looks forward to, but with the right know-how, you can make it as easy as possible. Here are some tips on how to clean your stove top and get it looking like new again.

1. Start by removing all of the parts from your stove top, such as the burners, grates, and any other removable parts. Place these in a sink filled with hot, soapy water and allow them to soak for a few minutes. This will help loosen any stuck-on food or grease that may be present.

2. Once the parts are finished soaking, use a sponge or scrub brush to gently scrub away any remaining residue from each piece. Be sure to rinse them off with warm water when finished.

3. Now it’s time to tackle the actual stove top itself. Begin by wiping down the surface with a damp cloth or paper towel to remove any loose dirt or debris. Next, mix equal parts baking soda and water together to form a paste and spread it over the entire surface of your stove top using a sponge or scrub brush. Allow this mixture to sit for 10-15 minutes before wiping it off with a clean cloth or paper towel. This will help remove any stuck-on food particles that may be present on your stove top.

4. Finish by giving your entire stove top a good wipe down using an all-purpose cleaner or white vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 2 parts water). This will help remove any remaining residue and leave your stove top looking sparkling clean!

With these simple steps, you’ll have your stove top looking like new in no time!
