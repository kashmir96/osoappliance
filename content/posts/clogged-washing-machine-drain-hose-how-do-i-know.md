## Diagnose a Clogged Washing Machine Drain Hose

Do your laundry cycles take too long? Is there water pooling in the bottom of your washer and making a mess on the floor? It might be a clogged washing machine drain hose! But how do you figure out if this is what's causing you problem? 

The washing machine drain hose, which is connected to the pump, pumps the water out of your washer. If the hose is blocked, it can prevent the machine from spinning. Furthermore, if it's not draining quickly enough, it can cause the washer to overflow. 

To diagnose the problem, start by unplugging the washing machine and moving it away from the wall. You'll want to look for any blockages in the drain hose. This can usually be done without having to remove the hose. Check for kinks which could be preventing a smooth flow of water. Then, check for any cracks. If there are cracked or kinked hoses, they should be replaced. 

If the hose is clear and functioning correctly, the problem may lie somewhere else in the system. you can check the pump filter to make sure it is not clogged by detaching the filter and cleaning out any debris. If it's clear, you'll need to move further downstream and inspect the drain pipe. To do this, you'll likely need to bring in a plumber.
