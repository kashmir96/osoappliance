## Professional Carpet Cleaning with a Commercial Cleaner
Having a professional clean your carpets can give your home a refreshed and inviting feel. But if you’re on a budget, hiring a professional to do the job can be costly. So what do you do? You can achieve professional results and save money by renting a commercial carpet cleaner. 

Commercial carpet cleaners are powerful and effective machines that use hot water and cleaning solution to deep clean and extract dirt, spills, and stains from your carpets. The combination of hot water and strong suction power can leave your carpets looking as good as new. Depending on the size of your job, you can either rent a machine for a few hours or for a few days. Carpet cleaners come with all the necessary tools, such as hoses and attachments, so you can start cleaning right away. 

To get the best results, you’ll need to be familiar with the machine and its settings so that you can use it in a safe and effective manner. Before using your rental machine, read the instructions thoroughly to make sure you’re following all safety procedures. You’ll also want to make sure you’re using the right type of cleaning solution for your carpet. The wrong solution can damage your carpets, so make sure you know what type of solution your machine requires. 

Once you know how to safely and correctly operate the machine, it’s time to deep clean your carpets! Begin with the high-traffic areas and work your way to the outside, making sure to rinse thoroughly between each pass. When you’re finished cleaning, it’s important to give your carpets a few hours to dry before you walk on them or replace any furniture. This will help ensure that your carpets are clean and free from dirt or mildew.

Using a commercial carpet cleaner is a great way to get professional results without having to hire a professional. Just be sure to read and follow the directions, use the correct cleaning solution, and allow enough time for your carpets to dry. If you’re still unsure of how to clean carpets with a commercial carpet cleaner, consider enlisting help from the [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for added assurance.

## Getting Professional Results with a Commercial Carpet Cleaner

**What type of commercial carpet cleaner should I use for getting professional results?**

When selecting a carpet cleaner for getting professional results, look for a professional grade or commercial grade carpet cleaner with an adjustable brush speed and solution flow control. Professional grade carpet cleaners are often heavier and more powerful than consumer grade carpet cleaners and are designed for extensive everyday use.

**What should I use for carpet pretreatment?**

Using a pretreatment solution prior to cleaning the carpet is highly recommended for getting professional results. A self-neutralizing pre-spray should be applied to the entire area to be cleaned and left to dwell for at least 10-15 minutes to fully allow the soil to be lifted from the carpet.

**How do I clean the carpets after pretreating?**

Once the pre-spray has been applied, use the carpet cleaner machine to extract the soil and moisture from the carpets. Begin in the corner of the room and work your way outward. Be sure to overlap each pass of the machine to ensure thorough coverage and complete removal of soil.

**How often should I use a commercial carpet cleaner for getting professional results?**

For light to moderate use, a commercial carpet cleaner should be used at least once every three months. For homes with higher traffic, it is recommended to use a commercial cleaner every month for optimal results.

**What should I do for spot cleaning with a commercial carpet cleaner?**

For spot cleaning with a commercial carpet cleaner, use solution specifically designed for spot cleaning and fill the shampoo tank of the cleaner with the solution. Set the nozzle on the cleaning wand to the lowest setting and use it to lightly spray the stained area. Once the spot is treated and scrubbed gently with a brush, use the vacuum wand to extract the solution and soil from the carpet.
