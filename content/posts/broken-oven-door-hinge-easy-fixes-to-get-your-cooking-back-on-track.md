## Easy Fixes to Repair Common Oven Door Hinges

Cooking and baking are one of the most enjoyable activities, but a broken oven door hinge can be a real nuisance. While replacement may be necessary in extreme cases, many times an easy fix is all you need to get your cooking back on track. Here are some helpful tips and tricks you can use to repair and enjoy your oven once again.

The first attempt is to simply tighten the screws on the hinge. A loose screw may be the cause of the hinge’s failure, so a quick tightening with a Phillips-head screwdriver might be the solution you’re looking for. 

If the screws on the hinge seem tight, it is possible that the problem may be with the springs or the door itself. If your oven door is still moving in an awkward manner, check the springs to see if they need to be adjusted, as this could be impacting the movement of the door.

The last option is to use a lubricant to loosen the hinge. WD-40 or another type of all-purpose lubricant can get the hinge moving properly again. Be sure to inspect the hinge closely to ensure that its components are in good condition after lubricating it.

No matter the cause of the broken oven door hinge the most important thing is to get you back to cooking. Each of the recommendations above can help to solve the issue and return your favorite kitchen activities to normal. 

If the problem still persists, it may be time to call in the professionals. Check our [Appliance Repair Directory - Christchurch](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians/new-zealand/christchurch) for local repair technicians and get your oven back to its original shape.
