The air quality inside your home can have a major impact on your health and wellbeing. That’s why an air purifier is so important. An air purifier removes pollutants like dust, pollen, smoke, and other particles from the air to help maintain cleaner indoor air quality. Not only that, but they also help eliminate unpleasant odors and airborne bacteria. 

If you’re looking for an easy way to monitor and improve the air quality in your home, then an air purifier with Alexa compatibility is a great option. Alexa-enabled devices can be used to control and monitor your air purifier using voice commands. This allows you to quickly adjust settings such as fan speed or filter type without having to manually adjust the device itself. Plus, some models even feature built-in sensors that detect changes in the environment and automatically adjust settings accordingly for optimal performance. 

In addition to convenience, an Alexa-enabled device provides real-time feedback about the indoor environment through its app or dashboard viewable on any compatible device such as smartphones or tablets. This makes it easy for you to keep track of changes in the environment like temperature and humidity levels as well as monitor filter status so you know when it’s time for a change or replacement filter cartridge. 

Alexa integration also makes it easy to schedule cleaning cycles at specific times or intervals with just your voice! You can even turn on notifications so that Alexa will alert you when it’s time to replace filters or perform other maintenance tasks like checking fan speed and cleaning out dust chambers if necessary. 

If all of this sounds great but you don’t have an Alexa enabled device yet – not a problem! There are plenty of apps available both for iOS & Android that allow you to control & monitor your existing Air Purifier without having any extra hardware at all! All of these apps will let you manage settings & get feedback just like with an Alexa enabled device – but without needing Amazon Echo products too!
