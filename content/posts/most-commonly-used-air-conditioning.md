Air conditioning is a technology that has become an integral part of our lives. With so many different terms related to air conditioning, it can be difficult to understand the most common ones. In this blog, we'll take a look at some of the most commonly used air conditioning terms and what they mean.

First, let's start with HVAC or Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning. This is the umbrella term for all three components that work together to create a comfortable indoor environment. HVAC systems provide heating and cooling through ventilation and distribution of conditioned air throughout a space using ducts, fans, and other equipment.

Next up is SEER or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. This refers to how efficiently an air conditioner uses energy over a period of time - usually one cooling season or year - when operated under specific conditions specified by the Department of Energy (DOE). The higher the SEER rating on an AC unit, the more efficient it will be in saving energy costs over its lifetime. 

The next two terms relate to refrigerants: R-22 (Freon) and R-410A (Puron). These are both chemicals used in air conditioning systems as coolants to transfer heat from inside your home out into the atmosphere outside your home. R-22 was used in older AC models but has been phased out due to environmental concerns; newer models now use R-410A as its replacement due to its better efficiency ratings and lower environmental impact. 

Finally, let's talk about BTU or British Thermal Unit. This measurement is used for determining how much heat an AC unit can move from one area to another per hour; higher BTUs equal greater cooling capacity which allows larger spaces like commercial buildings or large homes with high ceilings to stay cooler faster than smaller ones with lower ceilings that require less BTUs for adequate cooling power. 

In conclusion, understanding these common air conditioning terms will help you make informed decisions when purchasing an AC unit for your home or business space!
