A commercial oven cleaner is an essential tool for any professional kitchen. It’s designed to make quick work of tough, baked-on grease and food residue that can accumulate inside your oven over time. With the right cleaner, you can keep your oven clean and running efficiently, as well as extend its lifespan.

Commercial oven cleaners come in a variety of forms, including liquids, sprays, gels and pastes. Each product has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of mess you are trying to clean up. For instance, liquid cleaners tend to be more effective at removing stubborn grease stains while gels or pastes are better for tackling heavily encrusted food particles.

When using a commercial oven cleaner it is important to read all directions before use and wear protective gloves when handling the product. Most products will require you to pre-clean the surface with a damp cloth before applying the cleaner directly onto the affected area. Depending on how soiled your oven is, you may need to let the product sit for 5-10 minutes before scrubbing away with a non-scratch scrubbing pad or brush in a circular motion until all dirt has been removed. After cleaning it’s important to rinse off any remaining residue with water before wiping down with a dry cloth or paper towel until completely dry 

Overall investing in an effective commercial grade oven cleaner will ensure your kitchen remains spotless while also extending the life of your appliance by preventing build up from occurring over time which could otherwise lead to costly repairs down the line!
