## Free Up Space in Your White Goods Freezer with Storage Solutions 
It's so easy to fill your freezer with an abundance of food and products, leaving less and less room to effectively and efficiently organise everything. To help keep your white goods freezer in optimal condition, here are some practical storage solutions that can make all the difference.

My top tip is to make use of the space you already have, so get creative with organisational methods. Keeping everything organised and orderly is a great way to make sure you use of all the available space in your freezer. Utilise plastic trays and crates, Tupperware containers and ice cube trays to ensure that everything has its own spot and remains in order. I also like to group items by type and group in each tray and container. This method is not only easier than stacking items on top of each other, but it also helps with longer storage life as each item remains intact and won’t be squished against other items.

Another helpful hint is to leave some space between items and don’t overfill containers to allow for circulation and airflow. Consider using shelving and special door bins to place items such as boxes of fish fingers or sauces as these can become near impossible to pull out single-handed, otherwise. If you have icy build up forming, defrost it regularly (at least every 6 months). This can be done by emptying your freezer, wiping down, and wiping up all the melted water.

For optimum organisation, consider labels so that you can easily identify items. This way, you won't be on a wild goose chase every time you forget what items you have stashed in the freezer. Keeping an inventory of what’s in your freezer will also help with meal planning, making grocery shopping a lot simpler and reduce unnecessary trips to the supermarket and take-aways. 

With these storage solutions and handy tips, you’ll have a well-organised and efficient freezer that’s set up to last. To find the perfect white goods freezer for your needs, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
