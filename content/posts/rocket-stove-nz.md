A rocket stove is a small, efficient and fuel-efficient stove that uses wood or other biomass fuels to cook food or heat your home. The design of the rocket stove is based on principles of thermodynamics and combustion science to create a high temperature, low emissions, and efficient burn. This type of stove has become increasingly popular in New Zealand as an environmentally friendly way to heat and cook in our homes.

The design of the rocket stove is relatively straightforward; it consists of an insulated chamber with a central chimney that pulls air into the firebox from underneath. This creates an efficient burn with very little smoke and ash produced. The insulation also helps keep heat inside the chamber for longer periods, meaning you can get more cooking time out of your fuel. Rocket stoves are also often designed with a secondary combustion chamber which helps to increase efficiency even further. 

There are many benefits to using a rocket stove for heating and cooking in New Zealand; firstly it’s one of the most eco-friendly options available because it uses renewable resources like wood or other biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels like oil, gas or coal. Secondly they’re highly efficient so they require less fuel than other stoves while still producing plenty of heat. And finally they’re very easy to use, so no special knowledge or skills are required to operate them successfully. 

If you’re interested in getting a rocket stove for your home then there are plenty of places in New Zealand where you can buy one; many hardware stores now stock them as do some online retailers such as Trade Me and Amazon NZ. Prices vary depending on size and features but generally speaking they’re quite affordable compared to other types of wood-burning stoves . 

Overall if you’re looking for an eco-friendly way to heat your home then a rocket stove could be the perfect choice for you; not only does it use renewable resources but it also offers high efficiency with low emissions making it ideal for anyone who wants to do their bit for the environment without sacrificing convenience or comfort!
