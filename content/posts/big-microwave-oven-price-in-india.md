Are you looking for a big microwave oven in India? If yes, then you must have come across some hefty price tags. But why are these microwaves so expensive? Well, there are different factors which contribute to the high prices of big microwave ovens in India – from their size and features to the brand name.

Size: Bigger microwaves usually cost more than smaller ones as they offer more space for cooking larger dishes. This means that if you need a larger capacity oven for your family’s needs, then it will definitely be pricier than a smaller one with fewer features. 

Features: Bigger microwaves usually come with advanced features like reheating and defrosting options, delay start timer and pre-set menus that make them easier to use and convenient. These additional features increase the overall cost of the appliance. 

Brand Name: The price of a big microwave also depends on its brand name. Higher-end brands like Samsung and LG may be priced higher than lesser known ones due to their superior quality assurance standards, advanced technology and better customer service support. 

Energy Efficiency: Bigger microwaves often have higher energy efficiency ratings compared to smaller ones as they consume less power while performing similar tasks efficiently. This can increase their costs further but also helps save money on electricity bills in the long run. 

All these factors contribute towards making bigger microwaves expensive in India but if you want convenience, quality assurance and energy savings then these appliances are worth investing in!
