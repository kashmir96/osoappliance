Waste disposal units are an efficient and necessary way to get rid of your kitchen waste. They are especially ideal for those living in New Zealand as the country has some of the strictest regulations on waste disposal. Choosing the right unit for your needs can be tricky, so here’s a breakdown of the best waste disposal units NZ has to offer.

The first kind of unit is an in-sink disposer from companies like InSinkErator. This type is mounted under your sink and uses a grinding system to quickly break down food particles into small pieces that easily pass through plumbing systems without causing blockages or other issues. Their models range from simple single-stage grinders up to more advanced multi-stage grinders with features like auto reverse and sound reduction technology. These units are easy to install, require minimal maintenance, and come with a warranty for added peace of mind.

The second type is a continuous feed disposer which can process larger amounts of food at once than an in-sink model can handle. These systems feature a powerful motor that grinds up food quickly while you add more waste into the unit without needing to stop it first. Companies such as Waste King offer robust designs that have corrosion proof components and come with lifetime warranties against jamming or clogging up your pipes – perfect for households who generate large amounts of food scraps each day! 

Finally, there’s also standalone garbage disposals which don’t require being installed under the sink at all – instead, you just need access to electricity and water outlets nearby where you can plug them in and get them running immediately! These models typically feature built-in filtration systems that separate solid matter from liquids before pushing everything down into sewer lines or septic tanks safely without any worries about clogs or blockages happening along the way either! Companies like Waste Maid offer reliable options made out of stainless steel construction that should last many years even with heavy use every day so they’re definitely worth considering if convenience is important too! 

All these types of waste disposal units make it easier than ever before to keep your kitchen clean while also protecting plumbing systems from potential backups due their advanced grinding technology – no matter what type suits best according to your needs, rest assured NZ has plenty great options available when choosing one today!
