## Troubleshooting Tips for a Broken Air Conditioner

If your air conditioner stops working, it can be a challenge to figure out what’s going on and how to get it running again. To help you diagnose and fix your broken air conditioner, here is a guide to some of the most common and least expensive problems. 

First, identify whether the air conditioner is turning on and functioning, but not cooling the air sufficiently, or if it’s not turning on at all. If it’s the latter, check the circuit breaker to be sure the unit is receiving power. If it’s the former, check the air filter to be sure it’s not clogged. Remove the filter and check for dirt, dust, lint and so on. If the filter is clean, then the issue is likely due to a refrigerant leak. 

If the issue is a refrigerant leak, then professional assistance is necessary. Refrigerant is a hazardous material and must be handled carefully and replaced properly. A licensed HVAC technician can identify any leaks, make repairs and refill the unit safely. 

Next, check to make sure the coils are clean and free of dust, dirt or any other debris. If the coils are not adequately cleaned, the unit will not cool air properly and will not function efficiently. An HVAC technician can thoroughly clean the coils and remove any debris. 

Additionally, it’s important to remove any debris from the outside unit of the air conditioner as well. Leaves, twigs, grass clippings and dirt can accumulate on and around the unit and impede proper airflow. To clean the outside unit, turn off the power and gently remove the debris. 

Finally, check the thermostat to ensure it’s set properly. Make sure there’s is nothing blocking the thermostat’s sensors. If after all these steps, the air conditioner is still not working properly, you may need to replace the unit. 

With these tips in mind, you should be well on your way to identifying and fixing your broken air conditioner.
