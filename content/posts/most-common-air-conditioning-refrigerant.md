Air conditioning systems use a refrigerant to provide cool air within a building. Refrigerants are chemical compounds that absorb heat and release it elsewhere. The most common type of air conditioning refrigerant is R-22, also known as Freon. It is a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) that has been used in residential and commercial air conditioners since the 1950s.

R-22 has been widely used due to its effectiveness and low cost. It is an ozone depleting substance, which means it damages the ozone layer in the atmosphere when released into the environment. Because of this, R-22 has been phased out in favor of other types of refrigerants that have less impact on the environment.

One of these new types of refrigerant is called R-410A, also known as Puron or GENETRON 410A. It is a non-ozone depleting hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) that can be used as a direct replacement for R-22 in existing air conditioners with no modifications required. R-410A works similarly to R-22 but operates at higher pressures, so an additional safety device such as an TXV or piston must be installed in order for it to function properly.

R-410A can provide up to 20 percent more cooling efficiency than older units using R-22, making it more energy efficient and cost effective over time. This makes it an ideal option for both residential and commercial applications where energy efficiency is important. In addition, because it does not deplete the ozone layer like other older refrigerants do, using R410A helps protect our environment from further damage caused by man made chemicals released into the atmosphere from AC systems.. 

Overall, while R-22 will continue to be available for some time due to its widespread use over many years, newer alternatives such as R410A are becoming increasingly popular due their energy efficiency and lack of environmental impact when compared with older CFC based refrigerants like Freon (R 22).
