When it comes to appliance repairs, you may be tempted to use a service like Just Answer for the convenience and low cost. However, there are several reasons why this is not a good idea.

First of all, the advice you get from Just Answer cannot be trusted. The “experts” giving this advice are anonymous and may not have any real training or experience in appliance repair. Furthermore, they cannot see what you are seeing at your home. Without this firsthand knowledge it is easy to give inaccurate advice that could lead to more damage or even injury from attempting a repair yourself.

Second, the fees associated with using Just Answer can add up quickly if you need multiple pieces of advice for the same problem. You will be paying for each answer separately rather than getting one fixed fee for an entire repair job like you would with a professional technician. 

Thirdly, just answer has dodgy rating when it comes to charging ongoing fees and not refunding customers who are not satisfied with the service. This can be a huge risk for those who are spending money on repairs and need to ensure that they get their money’s worth.

Finally, when it comes to appliance repairs, time is of the essence and waiting for answers from Just Answer can take days or even weeks depending on how busy their experts are at any given time. This can add more stress and hassle when all you want is your appliance back in working order as soon as possible! 

For these reasons, it’s best to avoid using services like Just Answer when dealing with appliance repairs and instead hire a professional technician who knows what they’re doing and has years of experience solving complex issues quickly and safely
