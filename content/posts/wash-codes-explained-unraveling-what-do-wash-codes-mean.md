## Unraveling the Meaning Behind Wash Codes

Wash codes come in many shapes and sizes but have you ever wondered what they mean? Understanding wash codes is important for making responsible purchasing decisions for your home appliances and can help inform you on types of fabrics, temperatures, and how to care for different fabrics. This guide will help you understand what each wash code symbol means. 

Wash codes are usually shown on a tag sewn onto clothing and fabrics. The codes show a specific wash cycle and laundry instructions to follow. Different symbols can represent different temperatures, types of detergent to use, and more. While some symbols are common between brands, it's best to pay attention to the laundry instructions tag so you know exactly how you should wash an item. 

The most common symbols are the easy care symbols, which include *Wash, Do not wash, and Dry clean only*. However, other codes such as *Bleaching allowed, Tumble dry and Ironing allowed*, and more, can be used together or separately. 

For example, the "Wash" symbol indicates the fabric is machine washable and the "Ironing allowed" symbol means you can have your fabric steamed or ironed, as long as you do it on a low heat setting and take extra care not to burn the fabric. 

When it comes to temperatures, it's important to follow the wash action symbols, such as *PERMANENT press, DELICATE/GENTLE, NORMAL wash*, to ensure that the product you are using is suitable for the fabric. For instance, the "NORMAL" wash symbol means the fabric should be washed in warm water, rather than hot or cold, to keep the fabric looking like new. 

So, now that you know what wash codes mean, you can make more informed purchasing decisions when it comes to fabrics and clothing. To make sure you're always up-to-date on appliance-related error codes, be sure to check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/).
