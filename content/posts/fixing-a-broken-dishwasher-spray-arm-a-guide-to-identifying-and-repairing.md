## How to Identify and Fix a Faulty Dishwasher Spray Arm
Are you frustrated with a faulty dishwasher spray arm that isn’t up to the job? Maybe it’s not spinning properly or spraying water around the inside of the machine. Don’t fret, you are not alone. This is a common problem and thankfully can mostly be repaired at home. 

Firstly, in order to begin the repair work, you will need to identify what is causing the issue. It is relatively simple to locate the spray arm and determine if it’s malfunctioning. The dishwasher spray arm is slightly different in shape from other parts of the dishwasher, being cone-shaped and situated at the bottom of the dishwasher. Oftentimes food and debris can build up on the spray arm, clogging the nozzles. For this reason, be sure to run a thorough cleaning cycle regularly. 

Another issue could be that the spray arm or its motor are dysfunctional. If this is the case, you may be able to repair it yourself or look into a professional repair. Depending on the age and makeup of your dishwasher, it may be necessary to purchase a whole new spray arm rather than individual parts. 

Once you’ve identified the cause of the problem, take the necessary steps to replace it. There are a few resources available to help you with this, including videos, tutorials, or repair guides. If you’re not comfortable replacing the parts yourself, many appliance repair technicians are available to assist you. 

Fixing a faulty dishwasher spray arm can be easily done by anyone once the cause of the issue is identified. Acknowledging the importance of a functioning spray arm is key because it provides your dishwasher with the most efficient performance and leaves your dishes sparkling clean. Take this advice to ensure your dishes are always spotless when you open up the dishwasher.
