When it comes to food storage, you may be wondering what is the difference between a refrigerator and a freezer, or what is a fridge? Well, this blog post will explain the differences between all three of these appliances. 

A refrigerator (or fridge) is an appliance that keeps food cold by circulating cold air inside its walls. This allows it to keep food at safe temperatures for consumption. A refrigerator typically has two to four shelves or drawers in which fresh produce, dairy products, and other items can be stored. It also typically has a door or door pockets for storing frozen foods such as ice cream and frozen dinners. The temperature inside a refrigerator should be kept between 35-40 degrees Fahrenheit. 

A freezer is similar to a refrigerator in that it keeps food cold by circulating cool air throughout its walls; however, the temperature inside of a freezer is much colder than that of a refrigerator—typically around 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Foods are stored inside freezers for long-term storage in order to preserve their flavor and texture for months at a time. Common items stored in freezers include meats, vegetables, fruits, ice cream, and other frozen treats like popsicles and TV dinners. 

In contrast to both the refrigerator and the freezer is an icebox or cooler—an appliance used primarily outdoors or while on-the-go in order to store perishable items such as fruits and vegetables without spoilage due to heat exposure over time. The temperature inside an icebox can range from 10-50 degrees Fahrenheit depending on how much ice or cooling elements are inside the box at any given time. 

So there you have it! Now you know the difference between fridges (refrigerators), freezers, and coolers (iceboxes). We hope this information helps make your grocery shopping experience easier!
