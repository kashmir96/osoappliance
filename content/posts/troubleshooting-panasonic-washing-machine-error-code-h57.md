## Troubleshooting Panasonic Washing Machine Error Code H57

Is your Panasonic washing machine displaying an error code ‘H57’? This error is less common than other errors, but can be just as frustrating if you’re otherwise in the middle of a cycle. Let’s take a look at the potential cause and methods for fixing it promptly.

The appliance error code ‘H57’ typically appears due to a malfunction in the main PCB. To check if this is the case, you’ll need to troubleshoot the main PCB, looking for any issues with the individual components on the board or the connections to other components. You’ll usually need to use a multimeter to do this as accurately as possible, before then looking to replace any parts which are faulty/damaged.

If you’ve done all this and are still having trouble, the issue could be related to the actual washing machine drum. The drum may be faulty and stuck, perhaps due to an issue with the direct drive system, or it could be something as simple as it being too full. If it’s the latter, you’ll need to remove some items from the drum and attempt the cycle again.

Should the problem persist, the next port of call is usually the electronic components, such as the inverter board, or individual parts like capacitors, transistors and resistors which may need to be replaced.

It’s important to note that DIY repairs to washing machines can be hazardous, especially due to the use of electricity that can be fatal if misused or mishandled. If you’re uncomfortable doing any of the above repairs yourself you should always contact the manufacturer for assistance or an authorised repair partner.
