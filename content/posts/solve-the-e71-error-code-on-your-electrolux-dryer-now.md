## Solving the E71 Error Code on Your Electrolux Dryer
Have you ever been in the middle of doing laundry and had your Electrolux dryer suddenly stop working and display an E71 error code? This error code means that there is a problem with the system's communication, but figuring out the root cause of the problem can be a tricky process. Thankfully, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and hopefully solve the problem on your own.

The first thing you should do is check for clogged vents or lint build-up in the dryer's interior. If the vents or lint trap are found excessively clogged, clean them out and restart the dryer. If the problem persists, check that the vent hose is connected securely at both ends, and that it isn't warped or blocked. Finally, check the wiring and electrical components of the dryer to see if any connections have become loose or disconnected.

If the error code persists after completing these tasks, it is likely that the problem lies with the motherboard. This component is responsible for controlling communications between the different parts of your dryer, and it may need to be serviced or replaced. If you are not confident in performing this repair yourself, it is best to call in a professional appliance repair technician to properly diagnose and fix the issue.

Having an Electrolux dryer suddenly stop working with an E71 error code can be a difficult situation. However, it is possible to troubleshoot the problem and solve it on your own if your problem is something as simple as a clogged vent or lint trap. Alternatively, for a more involved repair, it is best to enlist help from an experienced appliance repair technician. If you are in need of an experienced and trusted appliance repair technician, be sure to check out our directory of technicians.
