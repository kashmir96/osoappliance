This type of smart solution for staying warm utilizes a thin electrical Heater around the neck area and can be a great way to quickly increase the body temperature when you are feeling cold.

After the device has been turned on, it takes as much as 10 minutes to heat up to a comfortable level, however, you can be rest assured that the cut-off device triggers after 10 minutes to ensure that you never really get too hot. Furthermore, most of these electrical heaters are also designed with features such as overheating protection, power off after about two hours of continuous use, and low voltage protection to ensure the safety of users. 

In the long run, these thin electrical heaters may be a great investment for anyone who is looking for some warmth in the colder months.
