If you’re in the market for a new clothes dryer, it’s important to know how much you can expect to spend. The cost of a clothes dryer can vary greatly depending on the size and features that you need.

The most basic type of clothes dryers are those with just one drum and no other features. These usually range from $250-$400, depending on your location and the brand that you choose. These models are typically very simple and will only have a timer, temperature settings, and perhaps an air flow setting or two. They may also have a lint trap built into them as well as some more advanced options like energy-saving modes or steam options.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are large capacity front-loading models with lots of extra bells and whistles that can cost upwards of $1,000 or more. These types of machines offer many additional features such as multiple temperature settings for different fabrics, sensors to adjust drying time based on humidity levels in the air, steam functions for refreshing garments without washing them again, built-in wrinkle-reducing cycles and much more. If these added benefits are worth it to you then this is definitely an option to consider when purchasing a new clothes dryer.

Regardless of which type of dryer you choose at what price point, be sure to do your research so that you get one that meets all your needs without breaking your budget!
