## Upgrading Your White-ware Appliances - Understanding What They're Made Of
When it comes to upgrading your white-ware appliances, it's important to understand what your appliances are made of so you can properly maintain them. Whether you're replacing an existing appliance or buying a new one, it pays to know what materials it is comprised of and how best to keep it running.

When you are selecting a white-ware appliance, there are a few options when it comes to the type of material that will be used. For example, refrigerators, freezers and dishwashers can be made of stainless steel, white plastic, or black plastic. This material will determine how long the unit will last, as well as its resistance to corrosion and damage.

Stainless steel appliances can be more expensive, but they tend to last longer and can better withstand wear and tear. White plastic appliances are considered to be a budget-friendly option, while black plastic is not as durable.

Another factor to consider when selecting a white-ware appliance is how easy it will be to clean and maintain. Stainless steel can be wiped down with a damp cloth and white plastic can typically be rinsed off with a mild soap and water solution. Black plastic, however, tends to be difficult to keep clean and may require more extensive cleaning.

In addition to purchasing or replacing white-ware appliances, there are a few other steps you can take to ensure your units last as long as possible. Regularly wiping down and maintaining the exterior, vacuuming underneath the appliance and pulling it out when repairs are needed are all good practices to follow.

When it comes to selecting and caring for white-ware appliances, it pays to understand what they are made of and how best to maintain them. Taking the time to think through these decisions ahead of time can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
