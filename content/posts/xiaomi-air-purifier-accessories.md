Xiaomi air purifier accessories are the perfect complement to your air purifier, helping you get the most out of your device. These accessories range from filters and covers to humidifiers and even LED light bulbs. 

Filters – Air filters are one of the most important accessories for any air purifier. Xiaomi offers a variety of replacement filters to fit different sizes and types of air purifiers. The most popular filter is the HEPA filter, which captures 99.97% of all airborne particles down to 0.3 microns in size, including pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold spores and more. 

Covers – If you want to keep your air purifier dust-free when not in use, a cover is a great option. Xiaomi offers several different types of protective covers for their air purifiers that help keep them clean and free from dust buildup while they’re being stored or moved around the home or office. 

Humidifiers – Humidifiers can be used with Xiaomi’s air purifiers to add humidity into dry indoor environments or help reduce allergens like dust mites that thrive in low humidity conditions. The humidifier attachment works by adding moisture into the air as it passes through the filter while still filtering out harmful particles like smoke particles or pollen that can aggravate allergies and asthma symptoms. 

LED Light Bulbs – Xiaomi also offers LED light bulbs that can be connected to their air purifier. These bulbs produce a soft and pleasant glow while helping to clean the air of harmful particles like smoke and dust. They are available in a variety of colors and styles, so you can choose the perfect one for your environment. 

These are just some of the accessories that Xiaomi offers for their air purifiers. With all of these options, you’ll be able to get the most out of your device and keep your indoor air quality at its best!
