Stovetop is a type of cookware that is used to prepare food on the stove. It consists of a base, usually made of metal, with several burners or heating elements set into it. This type of cookware is ideal for preparing a variety of dishes, from boiling water for pasta to sautéing vegetables. It can also be used for baking and roasting meats and vegetables.

Stovetop cookware comes in a variety of sizes and materials, including stainless steel, aluminum, copper, and cast iron. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to cooking. For example, stainless steel is highly durable but may not retain heat as well as other materials; aluminum heats up quickly but may not last as long; copper provides even heat distribution but may be expensive; and cast iron retains heat well but requires regular seasoning to prevent rusting. 

No matter what material you choose, stovetop cookware can be used to make a variety of dishes such as soups and stews, stir-fries, pasta dishes, omelets, pancakes, grilled sandwiches and more. The key to successful stovetop cooking is controlling the heat so that the food doesn’t burn or stick to the pan. Many pans come with adjustable temperature controls so you can easily adjust the heat level while cooking. 

Whether you’re looking for an affordable way to start your kitchen or an upgrade from your existing cookware set, stovetop cookware is an essential tool in any kitchen. With its wide range of uses and versatility in both cooking methods and ingredients used — no matter what your skill level — you can use this versatile kitchen tool to create delicious meals quickly!
