## What Household Appliance Uses the Most Copper?
When it comes to large household appliances, copper is often an essential component as it is an excellent heat and electrical conductor. It is also very durable and can withstand extreme temperatures. So, when we look at the appliance with the most copper in it, what device would it be? 

Most home appliances have at least some copper in them. Washing machines, stoves, and airconditioners all contain varying levels of copper. But when it comes to the device with the most copper, refrigerators are in first place. Refrigerator coils are almost entirely made up of copper, and the average fridge contains about 15 feet of it.

The reason why refrigerator coils contain so much copper is because it needs to pass electricity in order to create a cooling effect. It's estimated that a refrigerator uses as much as 150 watts of energy, so having a large enough coil with enough copper to pass the current is vital.

When it comes to other home appliances with copper in them, dishwashers, microwaves, and dehydrators can also contain copper in their designs. However, these are often much lower amounts than what is found in a refrigerator, as these appliances do not need nearly as much electricity for their functions.

Overall, it's fair to say that if you want to find the device with the most copper in it, the refrigerator would be the one. And when it comes to making sure that your refrigerator runs efficiently and lasts long, maintaining it is key.
