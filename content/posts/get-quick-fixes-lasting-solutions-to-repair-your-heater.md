While most home and office users likely won't be familiar enough with the machinery to make repairs, there are quick and lasting fixes available. 

If your heating unit has stopped working suddenly, you'll want to get a professional to come and inspect it. Oftentimes the fault is a simple fix that doesn't require a full repair. If a part needs to be replaced, make sure you look for a quality part that is compatible with your model and make sure it is professionally fitted for safety. 

If you're having trouble maintaining your original heating load or thermostat settings, the best solution is often to have a qualified repair technician to come and inspect your heater. A technician might be able to opt for a smaller fix or tweak the settings to get your heater running the way it was intended. Check the settings of your furnace, making sure the filter isn't clogged and the thermostat is up to par. 

If you've had to keep your heater running longer than usual to keep warm, you should consider investing in an energy efficient model. When you finally upgrade to a new heating unit, you can enjoy the benefits of an energy efficient system to save on your bills. 

 
In conclusion, when your heater is not running efficiently, there are quick and easy fixes available. Have a qualified technician come and inspect the unit thoroughly. Check settings and filters and opt for a quality replacement part if necessary. If you've kept your heater running longer than normal, consider investing in a new, energy efficient model.
