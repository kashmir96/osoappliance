Water coolers are a common sight in offices, gyms, and homes. They provide a convenient source of cold drinking water and can even be used to make hot drinks like coffee or tea. However, there have been some concerns raised about the safety of using water coolers.

The first concern is related to hygiene. Water coolers are essentially large containers of still water which may not be changed regularly. This means that if the cooler isn’t cleaned properly, bacteria can build up over time and contaminate the water. To combat this issue, it’s important to make sure you clean your water cooler regularly with an antibacterial solution and ensure that it is maintained according to manufacturer instructions.

Another concern is related to exposure to chemical contaminants from plastic parts or from pipes used in the cooling process. In order to reduce the risk of contamination from chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA), it’s important to purchase a cooler that has been certified for food contact and use stainless steel pipes for cooling rather than plastic ones. Additionally, regular maintenance such as replacing filters can help reduce any potential exposure risks associated with chemical contaminants in the cooler's water supply. 

Finally, there have been some reports of increased levels of lead found in drinking water from certain types of old-style coolers due to corrosion occurring between copper piping and galvanized steel tanks used within these types of coolers. To reduce this risk, modern-day coolers should use stainless steel tanks rather than galvanized ones since they are less prone to corrosion over time and therefore will not leach lead into your drinking water supply as readily as their older counterparts do So overall if you choose an appropriate design with safe materials for construction which also has proper filtration system you should be safe from any health hazards posed by using a Water Cooler!
