If your fridge is making a loud clunk noise, it can be unsettling and annoying. It may indicate that something is wrong with your refrigerator and needs to be fixed. Luckily, there are usually some simple things you can do yourself before having to contact a repair service. 

The most common cause of a loud clunk noise coming from the fridge is something blocking the condenser fan blades. The fan blade may become blocked with dust or debris, which causes it to hit against the other components inside the fridge and make a loud noise as it tries to run. If this is happening in your fridge, first check if you can spot any visible blockages around the condenser fan blades or any other component of your refrigerator’s interior. If so, use a vacuum cleaner to carefully remove these blockages and see if this helps reduce the clunking noise. 

Another potential cause of the problem could be worn out bearings in either the evaporator or condenser fans – again these are components found inside your refrigerator’s interior that help circulate air around its cooling system. If you think this might be an issue for you then try replacing these fans yourself before calling a repair service – most appliance stores offer pre-assembled replacement fan units for fridges which are easy enough for anyone to install themselves at home without needing professional help or advice on how to do so safely and correctly. 

If none of these solutions eliminate the clunking noise from your fridge then it could mean that there is some more serious issue with its cooling system which should always be investigated by an experienced repair service rather than attempted at home by amateur DIYers! A technician will have access to all necessary equipment (including gauges) needed in order to diagnose and fix whatever problem may exist within your refrigerator’s cooling system quickly and accurately – so don’t hesitate when it comes time for repairs!
