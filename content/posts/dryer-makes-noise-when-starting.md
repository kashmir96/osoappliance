As a homeowner, hearing your dryer make a noise when you start it can be concerning. You may be wondering what the cause of the noise is and if it will require expensive repairs. Fortunately, there are some common reasons why your dryer might be making noises when starting and ways to try to fix them yourself before contacting a repair service. 

One of the most common reasons why your dryer might make a noise when starting is due to an unbalanced load. When you put too many items into your dryer or an unevenly distributed load, it can cause the drum inside the machine to become off balance and create loud noises as it begins spinning. The best way to fix this is by simply redistributing or reducing the amount of laundry in your drum until everything is balanced again. 

Another possible cause of loud noises when starting could be worn out suspension rods or springs inside of the machine that support its inner drum while in operation. Over time these components can wear down from regular use and eventually break causing loud banging noises as they start spinning up during a cycle. To resolve this issue, you’ll need to replace those particular components with new ones that match up with your model number which can usually be found on a sticker on backside of machine or online stores like Amazon for relatively cheap cost . 

Lastly, if all else fails one last thing you could check for would be any foreign objects stuck in between the drum and belt such as coins change socks etcetera that have made their way into those areas during previous loads leading them trap resulting in strange noises upon start up . To check for these simply unplugged machine open up door inspect both sides manually which should hopefully allow you locate remove anything that shouldn’t be there . 

Overall while dealing with noisy dryers at home can seem daunting at first taking time diagnose potential causes what might save you lot money repair costs down road especially if component part repairs are necessary so hopefully going through above steps help get matter resolved quickly easily efficiently !
