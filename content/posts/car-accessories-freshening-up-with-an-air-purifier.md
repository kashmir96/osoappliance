## Freshening Your Home With an Air Purifier 
We all want to feel and breathe fresh air when we are at home. The truth, however, is that the air indoors can get just as stale and contaminated as the air outdoors. The most common way to rid your home of potentially harmful toxins is to install an air purifier, which is a home appliance that cleans the air to make it safe for you and your family. 

An air purifier filters the air in your home to remove pollutants such as dust, pet dander and other allergens. It may also remove larger particles such as cigarette smoke and pollen, as well as odors from cooking and other activities. Air purifiers also work to improve the overall air quality by removing particles from the air to make it healthier to breathe and less irritating to people with allergies. 

When shopping for an air purifier, look for a unit with a HEPA filter that is rated to efficiently remove particles such as dust, smoke and mold spores. The filter should also be easy to replace once it becomes clogged, so you don't have to worry about replacing it on a regular basis. There are also more advanced air purifiers that are designed to filter out volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other gaseous pollutants. These air purifiers are usually more expensive, but they offer a higher level of protection against any indoor air contaminants. 

Installing an air purifier can help make your home's air cleaner and fresher, making it a healthier place for you and your family. Regularly changing the filter and keeping a unit clean can also help maintain the air purifier's efficiency.
