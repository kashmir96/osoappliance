Air purifier reviews in 2022 will be more important than ever before. As air pollution continues to worsen, people are increasingly looking for ways to keep their homes and offices safe from harmful airborne contaminants. Air purifiers are becoming a popular choice for improving air quality, and understanding what the best products have to offer can help you make an informed decision when shopping for one. 

When it comes to air purifier reviews in 2022, some of the most important factors to consider include filter type and efficiency, air quality sensors, noise level, size and portability, cost and energy use, features such as ionization or ultraviolet light sterilization, additional health benefits like helping with allergies or asthma symptoms, and customer satisfaction ratings. 

Filters are the primary component of any air purifier and should be chosen based on their ability to capture particles of various sizes. The most common types are HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters which can remove 99.97% of particulates 0.3 microns in size or larger; carbon filters which absorb odors; ozone generators which produce ozone gas; UV light filters which kill bacteria by breaking down their cell walls; activated charcoal filters which absorb smoke particles; photo catalytic oxidation (PCO) filers which break down organic compounds; and ionizers which release electrically charged ions that attract particles like dust or pollen. 

Air quality sensors measure factors like humidity levels or the presence of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in your home's atmosphere -- both important indicators of indoor air pollution that can affect your health. Noise level is also an important factor -- especially if you're sensitive to loud noises -- so make sure you check the decibel rating before buying an air purifier for your home or office space. 

Size is another crucial factor when it comes to selecting an air purifier since smaller units tend to be louder than larger ones due to their fans running at higher speeds. Portability is also something you should consider if you're planning on moving your unit from room-to-room regularly as well as cost since some models may require expensive replacements over time while other models offer longer lasting filters with a lower price tag overall. 

In addition to filtering out pollutants from the environment around us, certain features such as ionization or UV light sterilization may offer additional health benefits such as reducing allergy symptoms or providing relief from asthma attacks by killing off airborne bacteria and viruses before they enter our bodies through our breathable air supply. Finally, look into customer satisfaction ratings online before making a purchase so that you know how reliable a particular product really is before investing in it yourself!
