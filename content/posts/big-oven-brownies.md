If you're looking for a classic, perfectly gooey and fudgy brownie recipe, Big Oven Brownies are definitely the way to go. Made with just a few simple ingredients, all of which you probably have on hand in your pantry, these brownies are sure to become an instant favorite. 

The key to making these Big Oven Brownies stand out is using melted butter instead of oil. This creates a much richer flavor and helps keep the edges of the brownie nice and crisp while keeping the center soft and moist. To bring out even more chocolatey flavor in this recipe, we also recommend adding cocoa powder or dark chocolate chips. You can also use semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips if that’s what you prefer! 

To get started on your Big Oven Brownies preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium bowl combine 1/2 cup (115 grams) melted butter with 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Then add 2 eggs one at a time beating well after each addition. Next add 3/4 cup (95 grams) all-purpose flour along with 1/3 cup (30 grams) cocoa powder and mix until combined. Finally stir in any optional ingredients such as chopped walnuts or dark chocolate chips then pour into an 8x8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper or greased lightly with butter or cooking spray. 

Bake for 25 minutes then remove from oven and let cool completely before cutting into squares. Enjoy!
