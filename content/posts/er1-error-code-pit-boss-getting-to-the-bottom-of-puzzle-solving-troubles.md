## Solving ER1 Error Codes on Pit Boss Barbecues 
If you've been having trouble with your Pit Boss barbecue due to an ER1 error code, you're not alone. The ER1 code is a common issue experienced by many Pit Boss owners and can be tricky to solve. In this blog, we'll take you through the steps to diagnose and fix this issue so you can get back to using your grill again.

The ER1 error code can be caused by a variety of issues with your Pit Boss BBQ. The most common issues include a faulty igniter electrode, a malfunctioning circuit board, or a problem with the temperature probe. To determine the cause of the error, you'll need to inspect your appliance and perform a few tests. 

If the problem is due to a faulty igniter electrode, all you'll need to do is replace the electrode. Keep in mind that as with any electric device, it's important to disconnect the power before performing repairs. Once the electrode is replaced, you'll need to reconnect the power and test the BBQ to ensure the problem was fixed.

In the case of a malfunctioning circuit board, you can try resetting the board by removing its power cord, waiting thirty seconds, and then plugging it back in. It's also important to check the circuit board for any signs of damage or debris that could be preventing it from operating correctly. 

Lastly, if the problem is with the temperature probe, you'll need to clean and reconnect the probe to the circuit board. First, use a brush to remove any debris and then make sure the probe is firmly inserted into the board. If this doesn't solve the issue, you may need to replace the temperature probe.

With a bit of troubleshooting and inspection, you can get to the bottom of any issue causing your Pit Boss BBQ to show an ER1 error code. If, however, you're still unable to resolve the problem, it's time to consult a professional for assistance.
