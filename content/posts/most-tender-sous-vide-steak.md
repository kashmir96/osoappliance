Sous vide steak is a form of cooking that produces incredibly tender, juicy and flavorful results. The process involves sealing the steak in an airtight bag and then cooking it at a low temperature in a water bath for an extended period of time. This method retains moisture, tenderizes the meat, and creates an even cook throughout. 

The key to sous vide steak is all in the preparation. First, choose your cut of meat carefully – it should be thick and well-marbled for best results. Next, season your steak generously with salt and pepper before placing it into an airtight bag (we recommend using food-grade vacuum sealer bags). Then submerge the bag into preheated water bath set between 130°F to 140°F (54°C to 60°C). For most recipes, you’ll want to cook for anywhere from 30 minutes up to 2 hours depending on thickness of steak and desired doneness level.

Once your sous vide steak is finished cooking, remove it from its bag and pat dry with paper towels. This step helps create a nice sear on the outside of the meat when you finish it off in a hot skillet or under your broiler. It also removes any excess moisture which can dilute flavor or cause steam burn when cooked too quickly over high heat without searing first. 

Finally – enjoy! Sous vide steaks are incredibly tender and juicy due to their low-and-slow approach so they make great centerpieces for dinners or special occasions where presentation matters as much as taste does!
