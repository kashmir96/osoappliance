## Easily Disposing of Old Household Appliances
At some point, every appliance needs to be upgraded or replaced. It’s important to think about how you will dispose of your old appliance the right way - and the best way to do that is with an easy-to-follow guide.

The first step when preparing an appliance for disposal is to disconnect and unplug the device. Also, it’s important to note that appliances should never be disposed of in landfills, due to their hazardous components.

Once the appliance has been disconnected, it can either be recycled, donated, or sold. If you’re selling the appliance, do so responsibly. Make sure you are selling a safe and functional product.

If the appliance is being recycled, contact your local recycling centre to find out the best way to do so. If you’re donating the appliance, research organizations that accept used appliances that are in good condition.

Once the appliance has been sold, donated, or recycled, you may need to hire an appliance repair technician to take it away. Research local appliance repair companies, and read customer reviews.

When getting rid of an appliance, safety is key. Always disconnect and unplug the appliance and either donate, recycle or responsibly sell the appliance. If you need help transporting the appliance, hire an experienced appliance repair technician.

Disposing of your old appliances the right way doesn’t have to be difficult. Keep this guide in mind and make sure you’re disposing of your used appliance responsibly. If you're looking for qualified appliance repair technicians, take a look at our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians.
