## Eliminating 7e Error in Samsung Dishwashers

When you encounter an error code 7e in your Samsung dishwasher, you may initially worry your machine may be beyond repair or that the process of returning it and getting a new one is complicated and expensive. Rest assured it is fairly simple to troubleshoot a 7e error code and get your dishwasher functioning effectively once again. 

The first step is to determine which department is affected. 7e can represent either a drain issue or a motor issue depending on the type of Samsung dishwasher you have. Without further information it is important to investigate both departments. 

To investigate potential drainage issues, start by checking the hose for any blockage or clogs. Make sure that the water output is free and not blocked. For the motor, check for any loose wire connections in the rear of the dishwasher. If the hose and wires seem in good shape, the issue may be a more complex internal fault. In these cases consider calling a repair service with experience in dishwasher repair.

No matter the issue, a 7e error code is definitely a fault with your machine but that doesn’t necessitate you need a new dishwasher. With some troubleshooting you should be able to extend the life of your machine and save yourself some money.

It is advisable that you take steps to ensure the error doesn’t reoccur. The [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) provides common error codes as well as guidance on preventative care and troubleshooting advice. Utilizing this resource can help you better identify and prevent these same issues from happening with your Samsung dishwasher in the future.
