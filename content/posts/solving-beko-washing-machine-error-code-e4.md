## Troubleshooting Beko Washing Machine Error Code E4
Having a washing machine malfunction can be incredibly irritating. If you have a Beko washing machine and it is displaying an error code of E4 then you have come to the right place. There are a few different solutions that you can try to fix the issue before calling a professional.

Firstly, check to see if the water supply line is properly connected to the tap and inlet hose. If the connection is loose, then it will cause an E4 error code. You should also ensure that the inlet valve isn't blocked because water needs to reach the washer at a certain level before it will start.

Secondly, you should empty the detergent drawer. Detergents can cause sudsing problems and if too much detergent is used then it can create a sudsing effect which will prevent the washer from filling up or will cause suds to back up into the washer. If this is the case, then the washer won't fill and the E4 error code will display.

Finally, try unplugging the washer and plugging it back in after about 25 minutes. This will give the washer time to reset itself and the E4 error code may disappear.

If none of these tactics work, then it is highly recommended to call a professional and have them take a look. A knowledgeable technician can diagnose and repair any issue around the E4 error code. 

It's important to resolve any issues with your Beko washing machine as soon as they appear. Diagnosing and repairing errors before they can lead to more serious problems is key when it comes to making sure your washer runs well.
