However, with ever-changing technology and a variety of options, it is important to understand proper appliance management and why it matters. 

When managing appliances, the key is to keep them in good working condition. This means regularly checking the wiring, cleaning any dirt or dust buildup and testing the appliance before use. In addition, taking proper care of appliances helps to extend the life of each appliance. By properly managing the appliance, it will last longer, since maintenance allows the device to operate correctly and safely.
