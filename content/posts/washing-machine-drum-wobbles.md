# Washing machine drum wobbles

If you’ve ever noticed your washing machine drum wobbling during a cycle, you’re not alone. Washing machine drum wobbling is a common issue that can be caused by a few different factors. In this blog, we’ll explain what causes washing machine drum wobble and how to fix it.

The most common cause of washing machine drum wobble is an unbalanced load. When the load inside the washer isn’t evenly distributed, it can cause the drum to shake and vibrate during the spin cycle. To fix this issue, redistribute the clothes in the washer so that they are evenly spread out around the drum. You may also need to adjust the water level or spin speed settings on your washer to help balance out the load.

Another possible cause of washing machine drum wobble is an unbalanced suspension system. The suspension system helps keep your washer steady during operation, and if it becomes worn or damaged over time, it can lead to excessive vibration and shaking of the drum during cycles. To fix this issue, you’ll need to replace any worn or damaged suspension parts in your washer with new ones.

Finally, another potential cause of washing machine drum wobble is an overloaded washer. If you are putting too many clothes in your washer at once, it can lead to excessive vibration and shaking of the drum during cycles as well as poor cleaning performance due to an unevenly distributed load. To avoid this issue, make sure that you don’t overload your washer when doing laundry and always follow manufacturer instructions for proper loading amounts for each cycle type.

In conclusion, there are several potential causes of washing machine drum wobble including an unbalanced load, worn suspension parts, or an overloaded washer. If you experience any excessive vibration or shaking when using your washer, try redistributing the clothes in order to balance out the load or check for any worn suspension parts that may need replacing before calling a professional repair service for assistance with further troubleshooting steps if needed!
