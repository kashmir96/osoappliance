## Tackling TCL Errors in Your LG Washer
It's no fun when your LG washing machine stops working, so the last thing you need is stress. Fortunately, most LG washer errors won't require professional assistance. It's possible to read the error code and address the issue yourself. In this article, we'll help you demystify LG washer error code TCL and show you how you can address the associated error. 

The TCL error code stands for “taking too long” and is generally triggered if the washer detects that the washing cycle has been running for more than the set time. Oftentimes, this code can be caused by the items stuck in the drum, the wrong settings for the water temperature, or a problem with the washing machine’s pump or filter.

If you get the TCL error code on your LG washer, the first step is to stop the cycle and check the drum. Make sure there aren’t any clothes or large items preventing the drum from spinning. Additionally, check the water levels and settings to make sure you are washing with the correct temperature and settings. 

If the washing machine is still running too slowly, the chances are that a piece of clothing or a foreign object is lodged inside the pump filter. Take out the pump filter and clean it of any debris that may be preventing the natural flow of water. If the filter is damaged, you may need to replace it.

If your LG washer is still giving you a TCL error, then the problem is likely an electronic or mechanical issue. You can try disconnecting the washing machine from the mains and reconnecting it to reset it. You may also want to contact a reliable repair service.
