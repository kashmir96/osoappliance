## Steps to Resolve HC Error Code on Samsung Dryers

Most Samsung dryers are built to last, with vigilant maintenance and care; however, common problems such as error codes can be disruptive. The HC error code indicates that your Samsung dryer is having difficulty heating. This blog will explain how to troubleshoot an HC error code and resolve the problem. 

#### Step 1: Check the house circuit breakers

The first step is to check if the house circuit breakers have tripped. If they have, reset the breakers, and then check if the error message has been reset. 

#### Step 2: Check your ventilation system

If the circuit breakers are in working order, the next step is to check your dryer's ventilation system. Over time, lint and debris can accumulate within the vents, causing the dryer to overheat and display the HC error code. It is important to regularly clean out lint from the lint trap, lint chute, fan cover, and vents located both inside and outside your home.

#### Step 3: Inspect the thermostat and heating element

Next, inspect the thermostat and heating element. Make sure the thermostat is functioning properly, and there is no damage to the heating element assembly. If either the thermostat or heating element is not functioning or is damaged, you will need to replace them.

#### Conclusion

HC error messages can be a minor inconvenience, however troubleshooting them can be confusing. Following these three steps can help you quickly and easily resolve this issue. If you feel uncomfortable attempting these repairs yourself, contact a local appliance repair technician for help.
