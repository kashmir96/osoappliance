First, it's important to identify exactly which type of error code your appliance is showing. While all E1 codes mean there is a problem, the exact issue can vary from model to model. For example, a washer may display an E1 because it is having difficulty activating the heater element. Meanwhile, a refrigerator may display the same code when there is a problem with the temperature sensors. It's important to know the specific cause of the code in order to get the right fix. 

The next step is to reset your appliance. While this may not always fix the problem, it is the first step to diagnosing the issue with many appliances.

Finally, if your appliance is still showing the E1 error code, you may need to consult the manufacturer. Depending on your model and the specific problem, they may be able to point you towards the right repair.
