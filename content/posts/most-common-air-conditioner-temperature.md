Are you wondering what the most common air conditioner temperature settings are for your home? It can be hard to decide if it's too hot or too cold in your space, but luckily there are some general guidelines that you can use when setting the temperature of your air conditioner. 

The first thing to consider is the outside temperature. Generally speaking, when it's hot outside, you want to set your air conditioner about 7-10 degrees cooler than the current outside temperature. For example, if it’s 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) outside, then a good setting for your air conditioner would be 77-80 degrees Fahrenheit (25 - 27 Celsius). 

If you have an energy efficient air conditioning system in place and are looking to save on energy costs while still keeping cool, then you may want to try increasing the temperature by 1-2 degrees every few days until you reach a comfortable level. This will help reduce energy usage while still maintaining a comfortable level of cooling in your space. 

If it’s colder outside and extra heat is needed indoors during winter months, then consider setting the thermostat at 68-70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 - 21 Celsius). This will keep everyone warm while also helping reduce energy costs associated with heating up an entire house. 

Although these temperatures provide general guidelines, everyone has different preferences when it comes to their home’s comfort level — so there isn’t one exact setting for everyone! Experiment with different temperatures until you find what works best for both comfort and cost savings.
