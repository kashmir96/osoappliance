## Refresh Your Kitchen with Walmart Refrigerators

Revamping a kitchen or starting fresh in a new one doesn’t mean breaking the bank. Walmart has an extensive selection of affordable refrigerators to keep your food cold and fresher for longer. Refrigerators come in standard top and bottom configurations, side-by-side, french door, and chest freezers. No matter the size or layout of your kitchen, Walmart has a refrigerator to fit your needs.

The most popular choice amongst home cooks and maintenance staff is the classic top and bottom refrigerator. This design provides ample storage with both the freezer compartment and the refrigerator. Most top and bottom refrigerators will feature door shelves to store condiments and other items so you can keep them organized and easily accessible.

The side-by-side model has become increasingly popular in recent years. This design features two separate used compartments side-by-side, with doors that offer flexible configurations for customized storage. Larger items, such as large soda bottles, can be stored upright and smaller items can be stored on the door’s bottom shelf for a customizable interior.

French door refrigerators have a unique design that features two doors on the main freezer compartment and one full-length drawer in the refrigerator. This design allows for flexible and efficient food storage, while keeping commonly used items within easy reach.

Finally, chest freezers are great for storing large and bulky items, such as meats and frozen vegetables, and offer flexible usage customization. Depending on the model, chest freezers can be used with automatic defrosters to reduce manual defrosting and energy usage.

Whether you are starting fresh in a new kitchen or revamping your old one, Walmart has a refrigerator to fit your storage, size, and budget needs. From top and bottom configurations, to side-by-side, french door, to chest freezers, Walmart has a refrigerator to keep your food fresh and in order.
