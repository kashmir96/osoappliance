Air conditioning problems can be a huge inconvenience, especially during the summer months. From strange noises to increased energy bills, there are a variety of issues that can pop up when it comes to air conditioning. Fortunately, many of these problems have relatively easy solutions that don’t require too much time or money. Here are some common air conditioning problems and their solutions:

1) Strange noises coming from the unit - This is often caused by worn bearings or loose parts in the fan motor. The best way to fix this is to call in a professional technician who can properly diagnose and repair the problem for you. 

2) Poor indoor air quality - Poor indoor air quality is often caused by clogged filters or ducts that need cleaning. To fix this problem, you should start by replacing your current filter with one of higher quality, then cleaning out any debris from your ductwork. This will help improve airflow and reduce indoor allergens. 

3) Unit not cooling properly - If your unit isn’t cooling as efficiently as it should be, then there are a few things you can do to troubleshoot the issue. First, check your thermostat settings and make sure they’re correct for the time of day/season. Next, replace your air filter if it looks dirty or clogged up. Finally, inspect all vents around your home for blockages or restrictions that could be preventing proper airflow. 

4) High energy bills - If you’ve noticed an increase in energy bills without any changes in usage habits then there could be an issue with your unit itself. Start by checking all seals around windows/doors for drafts and leaks that could be letting conditioned air escape outside instead of into your home where it belongs! Additionally, consider upgrading your thermostat with one that has smart features like programmable scheduling so you don’t have to manually adjust temperatures throughout the day/weekend when no one is home! 

Although dealing with air conditioning problems can be frustrating at times, most issues have relatively simple solutions which don't require too much time or money! Knowing what potential problems may arise ahead of time will help keep them from becoming bigger headaches down the road!
