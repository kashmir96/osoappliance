## Don't Get Burned Buying a Used Heater 
It's tempting to shop for a used appliance to save money, but sometimes buying a second hand heater can end in expensive repairs. Avoid getting taken advantage of when you're looking to buy a used heater. 

It's always important to check the age and condition of a used heater. Most heaters need routine maintenance at least every 2-3 years. If you see a heaters that's been around for over 6 years, refrain from purchasing it as they may not be safe to use. Look for burn marks or dings in the vent and outlet pipe as these can be a sign of trouble. 

Also, consider the size and manufacturer of the used heater. While it can appear to cost a lot less for a custom made heater, you may be out of luck when you need to find replacement parts. If the parts are no longer available, your heater could end up dead. Even if you manage to find the parts, it could be more expensive than the cost of a new heater. 

A wise thing to do is have a qualified appliance repair technician inspect the heater before you buy it. They can look for any underlying problems before you make your purchase. This can save you time and money. 

Before you go out and buy a used heater, remember to do some research first. Always double-check the age and condition of the heater, check the size and manufacturer, and even consider having it inspected by a professional to ensure that you aren’t getting a lemon.
