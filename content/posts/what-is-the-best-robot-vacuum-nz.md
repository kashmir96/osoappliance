Robot vacuums have become increasingly popular over recent years due to their convenience and ease of use. For busy households, a robot vacuum can be an invaluable tool which saves time, energy and money. If you’re looking for the best robot vacuum for New Zealand homes, then there are a few key features you should consider. 

Firstly, look for a model that has powerful suction. This is particularly important if you have pets or live in a home with a lot of carpets or rugs. It’s also important that the model you choose is quiet – nobody wants to be disturbed by loud whirring while they’re trying to relax or work at home! 

Secondly, consider how sophisticated the navigation system is. Look for models with advanced sensors which can map out your home and adjust their cleaning paths accordingly so they don’t miss any spots. Some models are even able to avoid obstacles such as furniture and stairs on their own – this can save you from having to constantly supervise the robot vacuum while it cleans. 

Finally, think about how easy it will be to maintain the robot vacuum over time – look for models with detachable dustbins that are easy to empty and filters which need minimal cleaning or replacement so maintenance costs stay low in the long run. 

When it comes down to finding the best robot vacuum for New Zealand homes, there are lots of great options available on the market today – it all depends on what your needs are as well as your budget!
