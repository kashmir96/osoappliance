We all know that washing machines are a time-saving, convenient appliance that makes laundry a breeze. But did you know that your washing machine has several cycle options that can help you get the best clean and care for your clothes? Today’s blog will explain the different types of washing machine cycles so you can use them correctly to get the best results.

The first type of cycle is the gentle cycle, which is designed for delicate items such as lingerie and other lightweight clothing. The gentle cycle uses less agitation than other cycles and runs at a lower temperature to protect fabric from damage. This cycle can also be used on lightly soiled items when handwashing isn’t an option.

The second type of cycle is the normal or regular wash, which is great for everyday clothing such as jeans, t-shirts, and towels. This cycle uses more agitation than the gentle cycle but still maintains a low temperature to keep your clothes looking newer longer.

Thirdly, there is the heavy duty or “power wash” option which is perfect for heavily soiled loads such as work clothes or bedding items like blankets and comforters. This setting has more water pressure and higher temperatures to make sure all dirt and stains are removed from fabrics even after multiple washes. 

Finally, there are some specialty cycles available depending on your model of washing machine including permanent press, sanitize/allergen remove, quick wash/speed wash and pre-soak/soak cycles that can help target specific needs when doing laundry! For instance; if you want an extra deep clean for any item try using a pre-soak or soak setting before transferring it into the regular wash setting on your machine! Similarly; if you need an item cleaned quickly try using quick wash/speed wash settings to reduce total laundering time while still getting effective cleaning results! 


Overall; having these additional settings gives users more control over their laundry routine so they can customize it according to their individual needs! 
For more information about how to use each cycle properly be sure to read through your owner's manual carefully before starting any load of laundry in order ensure best results every time!
