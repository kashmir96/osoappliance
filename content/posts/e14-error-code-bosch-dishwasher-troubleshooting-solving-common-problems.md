## Solving Bosch Dishwasher E14 Error Code

We all enjoy the convenience of a dishwasher for taking care of the dishes. But when something goes wrong and disrupt the dishwasher’s functioning, it leads to dishwasher troubleshooting. One of the most common dishwasher errors is the E14 code on a Bosch dishwasher. This error code signals that the dishwasher wasn’t able to drain the water completely. It also indicates a potential problem with the drain pump. 

To solve the E14 code, the first thing to do is to clean the filters. The dishwasher filters in your sink will accumulate food debris and grease over time, blocking the water from draining. Plus, the dishwasher drain hose can become clogged with food particles too if it isn’t regularly checked. So start by thoroughly inspecting the drain filters and hose for any obstructions.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and the E14 code has been appearing for a prolonged period of time, it might indicate a more permanent problem. In this case, you should then check the drain pump for any damage or rotten pieces. If the drain pump has been damaged, the only way forward is to replace the drain pump entirely. 

In addition, the dishwasher can display the E14 code when the floor of your kitchen is too slippery or wet when you first turn on the machine. This is because the dishwasher can’t detect the water level correctly due to the slippery floor and will start to wash without any water. So it’s important to make sure the floor is dry when starting the dishwasher.

To ensure the efficacy and longevity of your dishwasher, it’s essential to keep it in good working condition. For bigger problems such as the E14 error code, you should consider professional help.
