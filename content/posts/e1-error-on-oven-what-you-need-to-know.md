## Understanding the E1 Error on Your Oven

An oven is one of the most used appliances in the home, so it's important to know what to do when something goes wrong. If you're seeing an error message like E1 on your oven, it's important to know what it means and how to address it. 

The E1 error code on ovens usually appears when there is a temperature sensor problem. The sensor monitors the temperature in the oven and if it fails, the code will appear to alert the user. The code is also known as an 'over temperature' or 'high temperature' error. 

The next step is to diagnose the issue more accurately. First, it's important to ensure the oven is properly connected to a power supply and there is no issue with the outlet. It's also recommended to reset the oven to its factory default settings as this can sometimes solve the issue. If the problem persists, it's recommended to replace the oven's temperature sensor.
