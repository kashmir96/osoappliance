If you’ve ever found yourself in the kitchen, baking a batch of delicious cookies with your favorite tunes playing in the background, only to suddenly hear a loud banging noise coming from your oven, you’re not alone! Ovens can make all kinds of noises, but none are as concerning as a loud banging noise. Before calling an appliance repair service person from our directory list and scheduling a costly repair visit, there are few simple steps you can take to try and troubleshoot the issue on your own. 

First, check that nothing is blocking or touching the oven door or sides. If something is obstructing it from closing properly or is putting pressure on certain parts when it does close, this could be causing the banging sound. Additionally, check for any loose screws and tighten them if needed. This will help keep everything securely in place and reduce any unnecessary banging noises caused by pieces shaking around inside your oven cavity during use. 

Next, open up your stovetop and examine its components inside. See if anything appears to be off kilter or out of place that could potentially cause issues with operation- this includes gas lines and electric components such as wiring harnesses or coils which can sometimes become displaced when cleaning happens too often or forcefully around them. If anything looks out of sorts here then it’s best to leave further investigation to an experienced appliance repair service person from our directory list who will know how to safely proceed with diagnostics on these parts without risking harm to yourself or others nearby while operating appliances like ovens. 

Finally- if all else fails- double check that all knobs are turned off before leaving the area where ovens are being used since these can create some pretty startling bangs at times! Properly shut down all appliances according to manufacturer instructions before leaving them unattended for long periods of time just in case something does go wrong during their use (such as a loud banging noise). Hopefully these tips will help get you back up baking again soon without having to call an appliance repair service person from our directory list quite yet!
