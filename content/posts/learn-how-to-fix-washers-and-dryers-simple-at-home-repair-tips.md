## Easy At-Home Repair Tips for Washers and Dryers
It can be frustrating when a household appliance like a washer or dryer stops working. While it's always best to hire a professional appliance repair technician to identify and solve more serious breakdowns, there are some simple DIY measures you can take at home to ensure a continued, safe and effective operation of your washer and dryer.

The most common issue with washers and dryers are lack of heat, smell, strange noises from the motor, and random cycle interruptions. Below are some key ways to spot a potential problem and tips on how to fix washers and dryers.

### Spot Issues & Take Action
If your washer or dryer is making a strange noise or displaying a peculiar smell, it could indicate that the circuit has overloaded. If this is the case, turn the machine off, unplug the power cord and remove the cover of the appliance, which is usually located at the bottom. Locate the motor and check for any frayed or loose wires. Tighten or repair them if needed.

The number one cause of overheating is clogged vents. Regularly inspecting and cleaning them can help avoid this common issue. Closing the vent not only increases your energy bill, but can cause the motor to overheat and shorten the life expectancy of your appliance.

### Prevention
Regular maintenance of your washer and dryer can help ensure parts, like the rubber seal on your washing machine, are in good condition. Doing an occasional load of only hot water mixed with bleach will help clean any built up bacteria. If your dryer stops spinning or taking too long to dry your clothes, it may be due to a broken belt. Instead of buying a replacement, you can usually simply repair this issue by tightening the belt.

Having the right tools to do repairs is also important. Homeowners should have a multi-meter, screwdriver and vacuum cleaner nearby to facilitate the process. Checking the levels of electricity going to or through the motor is essential, as any misalignment between the two can lead to potential problems or a breakdown of your machine.

Taking the steps to fix washers and dryers yourself can save a lot of money in repairs and potential breakdowns. However, while some simple DIY repairs can be done, it is still best to call a professional when dealing with major repairs or replacements. Our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) can help you find an experienced professional to handle more serious repair and maintenance tasks.

Taking the time to do some basic understanding and maintenance of your washer and dryer will save you time and money in the long run. It's also important to note that certain parts or repairs may be covered by your manufacturer or rental service provider. Take the time to research potential DIY repairs and call a professional when necessary to ensure your washer and dryer is working safely and efficiently.
