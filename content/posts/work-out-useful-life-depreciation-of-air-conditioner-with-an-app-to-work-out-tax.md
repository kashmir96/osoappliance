Depreciation is a tax deduction that allows you to claim the cost of an asset over its useful life. That means if you buy a new air conditioner, you can deduct some of the cost on your taxes each year. This can be a great way to save money and maximize your tax return.

Figuring out the useful life depreciation of an air conditioner can be tricky, but there’s an app for that! The IRS offers the Depreciation and Amortization Calculator app for both Android and iOS devices. This app helps you determine how much depreciation to claim for your air conditioner each year, based on its purchase price and estimated usage period. 

To begin, open the app and select “Air Conditioner” from the list of assets. Then enter in your purchase price (including any installation costs). Once that’s done, select how many years you think you’ll use it before replacing it with a new one. The app will then generate an estimate of what portion of your purchase price is deductible in each year over its useful life. 

For example, if you purchased a $2,000 air conditioner and estimated its useful life at 10 years, then $200 would be deductible in each year ($2,000/10). You can also use this same calculator to work out depreciation for other types of assets such as furniture or vehicles. 

Using this calculator is a great way to make sure you are claiming all eligible deductions on your taxes while still following IRS guidelines correctly. Keep in mind though that this calculator is just an estimate; always check with your accountant or tax preparer before filing any information with the IRS!
