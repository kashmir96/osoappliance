## Diagnosing a Washing Machine to Identify the Problem

For many of us, the washing machine is a lifeline. We depend on it to keep up with the demands of our household laundry. When something goes wrong, it can be frustrating and overwhelming. However, running a diagnostic and having a little know-how of the machine can help you resolves some issues and preparing you to call in the professionals, when necessary. 

Typically, when a washing machine isn’t performing properly, the first thing to do is to run through a few general troubleshooting steps. Start by checking the power source. Make sure that the machine is plugged in, your breaker is not tripped, and there are no kinks in the power cord. Once the power source has been verified, check the water intake valves. Make sure the hoses are connected properly to your water source and the faucets are turned on fully. 

The next step when running a diagnostic is to check the settings. It’s important to double check the cycle settings to ensure that the machine is set for the most appropriate type of load for the clothes being washed. Additionally, make sure the load size is properly adjusted. When the load size does not match the fabric type, the machine will not perform optimally. 

If the above steps have been completed without finding the source of the problem, it may be time to call a technician.
