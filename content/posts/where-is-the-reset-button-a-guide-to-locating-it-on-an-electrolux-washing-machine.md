## Finding the Reset Button On an Electrolux Washing Machine
As a homeowner, it can be confusing to locate the reset button on a washing machine, and every make and model has its own unique way of designating the button’s location. The week may come when you need to reset an Electrolux washing machine, and being familiar with where the reset button is in advance will make the process easier. 

The reset button on an Electrolux washing machine is typically located at the top right-hand corner of the control panel. Inside the start button, you may notice a small indent in the panel—this is the reset button, and you will need to press it firmly in order to complete the reset process. The reset panel may be identified with a ‘Reset’ label, making it easier to find the button. If you have difficulty locating the reset button, it is advised to refer to the machine’s user manual.

Once the reset button is pressed, the settings of the washing machine should go back to their factory defaults. This means that you will no longer be able to program settings like water temperature, wash settings, and spin settings. You'll instead have to reset those settings each time you load the machine with clothes. 

To ensure the best performance from your Electrolux washing machine, it is important to keep an error codes glossary close. Should your machine encounter a problem, a quick look at the glossary can easily match the error code to a potential issue, and then you can diagnose what needs to be fixed.
