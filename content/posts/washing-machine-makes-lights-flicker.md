Do you have a washing machine that makes the lights flicker? If so, there are a few things you can try before contacting an appliance repair technician from our directory.

First and foremost, check to make sure the outlet your washing machine is plugged into is working properly. Make sure it’s not overloaded with other appliances or electronics, and that it’s not located too close to any sort of heat source. If the outlet seems to be functioning correctly, then the next step is to inspect your washing machine for any loose wiring or frayed cords. Inspect all cables connected to your washer for signs of wear and tear, and be sure they’re securely connected at both ends.

If these steps don’t solve the problem, then it may be time to call an appliance repair technician from our directory. An experienced technician can diagnose what might be causing your lights to flicker while running your washer and let you know if there are parts that need replacing or repairs that need made in order for everything to run smoothly again. 

So if you find yourself with a washing machine making lights flicker, try these troubleshooting steps first before reaching out for help from an expert!
