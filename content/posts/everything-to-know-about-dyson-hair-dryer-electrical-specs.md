## Learn all about Dyson Hair Dryer Power Requirements
Choosing the right hair dryer for your home can seem like a daunting task. Not only do you have to pick the perfect style, shape, and build quality, but you also need to make sure you understand what type of electrical power requirements your dryer needs. When it comes to electrical specs, no blow dryer compares to the Dyson Hair Dryer.

The Dyson Hair Dryer was created with the intention of providing salon-quality results with all the convenience of working in the home environment. This means creating a dryer that’s powerful enough to do the job right, yet gentle enough to not damage hair. With this goal in mind, the Dyson engineers designed their dryers around a powerful yet efficient motor.

The Dyson Hair Dryer operates on a 16 Amp motor. This is the same kind of motor used by professional-grade styling tools, so you know you’re getting the same quality you’d get from a salon. What’s more, the motor operates using a fraction of the power you’d need for other dryers of the same size. This means that you save energy and money.

That’s not all. The Dyson Hair Dryer also operates on a 8.8 Amps voltage. This means that you don’t need as much power to run the device—you can simply plug it into any domestic wall outlet, be it 110 volts or 220 volts. In addition, the lower voltage helps to reduce the stress on your electrical system and will help prevent your unit from tripping the circuit breakerss.

Finally, the Dyson Hair Dryer uses the same type of power cable as all other domestic dryers, which means you don’t have to worry about compatibility or special extensions. So, there you have it—all the information you need to know about the electrical specs of the Dyson Hair Dryer.

When it comes to finding the perfect dryer for your home, you want to make sure you have the right information. With the Dyson Hair Dryer, you have a powerful yet energy efficient dryer that comes with all the convenience of a domestic model.
