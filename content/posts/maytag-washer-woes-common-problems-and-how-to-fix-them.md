## Fixing Typical Maytag Washer Issues

Reliable and dependable, Maytag washers can last for literal decades. But everyone knows that aging appliances can sometimes suffer hiccups. If your Maytag washer is having issues, read on for some helpful advice.

One of the most common problems is overfilling. To avoid this, make sure to use the appropriate amount of HE laundry detergent, as directed by the manufacturer. Too much soap causes washers to fill up and overflow, or suds up past the overflows. If there are suds, spin out the water using a rinse and spin cycle.

Doing a quick check of the hoses can also be helpful. Over time, hoses can develop tiny rips and holes, creating leaks around the washer. By replacing the hoses, it can help to maintain your washer’s peak performance. Furthermore, look for any cracks and lint around the lint filter. If there are, the filter should be replaced immediately.

Another frequent issue is when the washer doesn't power on, or when it won't start the cycle. You'll first need to make sure that the outlet is fully functional and the power switch toggle is on. In some cases, the lid switch might be defective. If that's the case, replace it with a compatible Maytag lid switch.

## Common Maytag Washer Problems and Solutions

**Q: How do I troubleshoot my Maytag washer?**

A: When troubleshooting your Maytag washer, the first step is to identify the problem. If the washer does not power on, then make sure the power cord is fully plugged into a working electrical outlet. Check the circuit breakers to make sure the power is not out in your home. If you are having trouble with water not draining properly or items getting caught in the spin cycle, check the drain hose for any blockages.

**Q: What should I do if my Maytag washer is shaking or vibrating heavily?**

A: If your Maytag washer is shaking or vibrating heavily, the most likely cause is an off-balanced load. Rearrange the items in the load so that the load is evenly distributed. Make sure the legs of the washer are leveled and secure, and that the appliance itself is not located near a wall or any other items that might cause it to shake excessively.

**Q: How do I know if the washer is overloaded?**

A: The best way to avoid fines, is to first check your Maytag washer’s manufacturer’s recommendations on maximum load sizes. If your washer is overloaded, the washer will not be able to spin properly, which will lead to a strange noise or vibration.

**Q: What should I do if my Maytag washer won’t fill up with water?**

A: If your washer won’t fill up with water, check the water supply hoses that attach to the back or the side of the washer. Make sure they are securely connected and the faucets they are connected to are open. Check the inlet screens for any possible blockages or debris, and clean if necessary.

**Q: Why is there water leaking from my Maytag washer?**

A: Water can leak from your Maytag washer for several reasons. The most common cause is a worn or cracked washer seal. The seal is located between the tub and the outer tub and can be replaced with a new seal if it is worn or cracked. Another potential cause is a loose water inlet hose, which is located on the back or side of the washer. Make sure that the hose is properly tightened to prevent water leaks.
