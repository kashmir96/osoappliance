If you're looking to feed a large group or party with steak, sous vide is the perfect solution. Sous vide is a cooking technique that uses precise temperature control to cook food in sealed plastic bags. This method of cooking is great for steak because it helps to ensure that each piece of meat comes out perfectly cooked and juicy. 

To start, you'll need to buy your steak from a butcher or grocery store. The best cuts for sous vide are ribeye, New York strip, and filet mignon because they are tender and have enough fat content to stay juicy when cooked in the sous vide machine. You'll then need to season the steaks with salt and pepper before sealing them into individual plastic bags using either a vacuum sealer or an immersion circulator with zip-top bags. 

Once your steak has been sealed up, set the temperature on your sous vide machine according to what type of doneness you want your steaks cooked at (e.g., medium rare = 131°F). Then place the sealed steaks into the water bath and let them cook until they reach an internal temperature of 131°F—this could take anywhere from 1-4 hours depending on how thick your steaks are. Once they’re done cooking, remove them from the water bath and pat dry with paper towels before searing them in a hot cast iron skillet or grilling them over high heat for about 1 minute per side until nicely browned (this will also help give it that nice flavor we all love!). 

Sous vide is an easy way to make sure all of your guests get evenly cooked steak without having to worry about overcooking some pieces while others remain undercooked—it's basically foolproof! Plus, since each piece can be individually sealed up before going into the water bath, all you have left do once ready is plate up everyone's meal!
