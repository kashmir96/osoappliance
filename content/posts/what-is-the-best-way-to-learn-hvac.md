If you’re looking to learn the basics of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems, the best way to start is by enrolling in an HVAC certification program. These programs typically provide comprehensive instruction in all aspects of HVAC design, installation and maintenance. You’ll learn about different types of HVAC systems, how they work and how to troubleshoot common problems. Additionally, many certification programs offer hands-on training with actual equipment so you can gain first-hand experience before you start working on your own.

Another great way to get started with learning about HVAC is by reading books dedicated to the subject. There are a wide variety of texts available that cover everything from basic principles to more advanced topics. Many books come with detailed diagrams and illustrations that make it easy to understand what you’re reading about. Reading these books can be a great way to supplement any formal training you receive or just do some independent research if you want a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Finally, there are numerous online resources available for those interested in learning more about HVAC systems as well as hands-on classes offered by local companies or organizations. Online courses offer a convenient way for students to continue their studies without having to take time away from their regular jobs or other commitments In addition, many local companies may be willing to let aspiring technicians shadow experienced professionals while they work on installations or repair projects; this can provide invaluable experience that will prove useful when applying for jobs later on down the road. 

Overall, learning about any new subject requires patience and dedication but following these steps should help get your foot in the door when it comes time for getting certified or finding employment in the field of heating and air conditioning design and installation. Good luck!
