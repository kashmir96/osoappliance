## Prepping for Cleaning Electrical Appliances
Cleaning all types of electrical appliances is an important part of keeping your home sanitised and functioning optimally. As all appliances have many delicate parts and components, it’s important to prep properly before beginning your thorough cleaning process. 

The first thing to do when preparing to clean your electrical appliances is to switch off and unplug the appliance completely. This is essential for reducing any risk of electric shock, as electrical current and water do not mix. Unplugging the appliance minimises the risk of electric shock when the cleaning process begins, so it’s essential to check that all cords have been disconnected before proceeding. 

Secondly, always check the care guide that comes with the appliance in case there are any specific instructions from the manufacturer that need to be followed. Different appliances may require different cleaning products and may require specific methods of cleaning – especially for sensitive components. Make sure you read the instructions thoroughly and follow all necessary steps for safe and successful cleaning. 

Thirdly, read the instructions on the cleaning product that you select. Many cleaners contain acids that may damage delicate components or materials. Be sure to only use mild, non-abrasive, anti-static cleaning products that are designed for use on various electrical appliances.

Finally, let the electrical appliance cool down before you begin the cleaning process. This is important for plastic parts to prevent them from becoming stuck or damaged, and some metal parts may become extremely hot to the touch. 

Cleaning all electrical appliances is an essential household task, but it’s important to take precautions and prep the appliances properly before beginning. Start by switching off and unplugging the appliance, check the care guide, read the instructions on the cleaning products, and let the appliance cool down - these four steps will help ensure a safe and successful cleaning experience.
