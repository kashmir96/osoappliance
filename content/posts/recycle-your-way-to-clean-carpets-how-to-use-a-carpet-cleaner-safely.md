Steam cleaning using a carpet cleaner is one of the easiest, most efficient ways to clean carpets and upholstery in the home. But if you're not familiar with the process, it can be intimidating. Here's a guide on how to safely and successfully recycle your way to clean carpets. 

When first buying a carpet cleaner, it's important to research which models offer the best performance.

The best way to find out which one is right for your carpet is to read online reviews. 

To steam clean your carpets, start by sweeping or vacuuming it to remove surface dirt and debris. Then mix your cleaning solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once your mixture is ready, attach the cleaner to the hot water faucet, and fill the steam cleaner's accompanying reservoir with the cleaning solution. 

Turn on the steam cleaner, and start in one corner of a room, working your way back and forth. This ensures that you don't miss a single spot and that the carpet is evenly cleaned. Once you have cleaned the entire area, switch off the steam cleaning machine and dispose of the used cleaning solution responsibly. Then put the clean, damp carpets outside to air dry.

Using a carpet cleaner is an effective way to keep your carpets fresh and free of dirt, grime, dust and allergens. You can even save money on the cost of carpet cleaner rental, refilling, and disposing the used solution by reusing or recycling it whenever possible.
