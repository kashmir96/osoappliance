## Dealing with an F06 Error Code on a Whirlpool Washer

When trying to run a load of laundry, a pesky F06 error code on the display of the Whirlpool washing machine can be an annoyance. What does this error code mean and what steps should be taken to diagnose and fix the problem? Read on to find out.

The F06 error code indicates a problem with the motor or motor control board. This can be due to a motor drive problem, motor control board problem, or a wiring issue. To diagnose this problem, start by unplugging the washing machine from the power outlet. Make sure the wires are all connected properly and that the plug is not loose. If everything looks okay, try plugging in a different appliance to the outlet to make sure it’s still working.

If that doesn’t fix the F06 code, then it’s time to move onto the more intricate inspection of the motor or motor control board. Make sure the wiring harness is connected properly, that all of the wires are connected firmly and securely, and that there are no burned out wires. All of these components come together to direct power to the washing machine motor.

Once everything is checked and double-checked, try testing the motor and motor control board. You can do this by checking the resistance with a multimeter. If the readings don’t match the manufacturer’s specifications, then the motor or motor control board will need to be replaced.

Troubleshooting and repairing the F06 error code on a Whirlpool washing machine requires knowledge and experience with handling specific parts and components. If you are not comfortable tackling this job yourself, then it is highly recommended that you call a professional technician.

Going through the necessary steps to diagnose and fix the F06 error code on your Whirlpool washing machine can be challenging. When it’s time to shop for replacement parts, be sure to use reputable and reliable appliance parts suppliers to ensure you are purchasing quality pieces.
