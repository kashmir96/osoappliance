## A Guide to Identifying Hazards Associated with Dryers
Through regular use, safety issues may arise with your dryer. Learning to identify common dryer hazards can help you keep your family safe.

Using a dryer along with other household appliances can provide convenience for your family. However, this convenience comes with the responsibility of keeping your family safe when using a dryer. With a few simple tips, you can help spot and address problems before they become a concern.

The top safety hazards associated with dryers are fire, property damage due to too much heat, and electric shock resulting from improper wiring and installation. To prevent these, you should regularly inspect your dryer for signs of wear and tear. Look for frayed or loose electrical cords, worn out insulation, and other signs of damage. Additionally, a buildup of lint on or inside your dryer can cause a fire, so it’s important to clean lint filters after every load.

It’s also important to only use venting materials recommended by your dryer’s manufacturer. Additionally, check your exhaust vent at least once per year for blockages and debris, and make sure the vent is venting to the outside, not the inside of your home.

Another important factor to consider is the type of power outlet you are using for your dryer. Make sure that you only use an outlet specifically made for a dryer; never try to use an outlet that is not designed for dryer use. Lastly, if your dryer ever begins to overheat, shut off the power and contact a professional immediately.

The best way to keep your family safe when using a dryer is to exercise caution and pay close attention to your dryer’s usage. By regularly inspecting it for signs of damage and regularly cleaning out lint, you can protect your family from potential fire hazards. Additionally, make sure not to skip regular maintenance or use materials not specified for your dryer. If you ever have questions about your dryer or any of the safety hazards associated with it, you can use our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary for more information.
