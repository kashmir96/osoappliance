## What You Should Know About Toasters & Kitchen Safety

Toasters are a common kitchen appliance that we rely on to quickly prepare a tasty slice of toast. But, if not given the care it needs, your toaster may present hazards in the form of fires, and electric shocks. Keep reading to learn more about the hidden dangers of toasters, and how to avoid kitchen disasters.

One of the most common hazards with toasters is fire. If left on too long, a piece of toast inside a toaster can begin to smolder and burn - this is a particular risk with thick pieces of sourdough toast. To reduce the risk, never leave your toaster unattended when toasting, and unplug it after use. Keep the toaster in an area free from flammable items, and regularly clean out any bits of crumbs or debris.

Electric shock is another risk posed by toasters. Electrical items should always be used with caution, and toasters are no exception. If you’re working on a toaster for any reason, be sure that it and its cable are unplugged from the power source. Toasters should also only be plugged directly into a wall socket, as any form of extension cord can be dangerous in many ways.

Excessive heat can also be a risk. To reduce the chance of overheating, refrain from using the toaster on high heat settings for extended periods of time. Also, check that it is not tucked away in a place too close to other items, as this can prevent it from radiating heat away and keep it too hot.

By following the tips outlined in this post, you can make sure that your toaster will be safe to use. If in doubt, or if you suspect a faulty toaster, you can always find a local appliance repair technician in our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
