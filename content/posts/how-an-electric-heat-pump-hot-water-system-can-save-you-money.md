## An Overview of Using An Electric Heat Pump Hot Water System to Cut Costs

Installing a hot water system can be a costly but necessary venture, however one way to cut these costs and reduce your long-term energy usage is to invest in an electric heat pump hot water system. Heat pumps are an energy efficient way of heating that can save you money on your electricity bills and make the switch to electric hot water less of a burden.

Heat pumps use energy from the air to heat the water, with the compressor and fan absorbing the heat to then transfer it to a tank of water. This efficient process helps reduce the energy needed to heat the water and, if you have a solar panel system, heat pumps are also compatible with capturing and utilising solar generated electricity.

The money saving benefits of a heat pump hot water system extends beyond just energy costs, as they’re designed to last a long time and take up very little space. With a long lifespan and their reliability, there’ll be no surprise breakdowns and the risk of expensive repairs. Plus, the minimal space requirements and the fact that heat pumps are available in both floor-mounted and wall-mounted variations makes them a great option for exercising flexibility when looking for a hot water system that works for you or your business’ space.

Investing in a heat pump hot water system means that you can shave a significant amount off your long-term energy usage in comparison to using a traditional hot water system. While their upfront cost can be steeper than other systems, the long-term savings will be worth it.
