## Problem Solved: E25 Error Code in Bosch Dishwashers

Are you experiencing an E25 error code with your Bosch dishwasher? If so, you are not alone! As Bosch products have become more popular in recent years, the prevalence of this issue has increased. Fortunately, the issue is relatively easy to troubleshoot and many times can be resolved without professional help. 

The most common cause of an E25 error in your Bosch dishwasher is a clogged drain hose. If you have not done so recently, it is always a good idea to check and clean the drain hose as this is an issue that frequently arises. If you are comfortable taking the dishwasher apart to access the drain hose or would prefer to have a professional do so, it could save you from calling for a repair.

In addition to the clogged drain hose, it is also possible for the E25 error code to be the result of a damaged water pump or faulty pressure switch. If the problem persists after checking the drain hose for clogs, it is best to call for a professional to check and diagnose the problem.

Overall, the E25 error code is a common issue with newer Bosch dishwashers. Thankfully, most of the time it is easily resolved. However, if taking the dishwasher apart or checking for clogs doesn't do the job, having a professional resolve the issue can save time and money.
