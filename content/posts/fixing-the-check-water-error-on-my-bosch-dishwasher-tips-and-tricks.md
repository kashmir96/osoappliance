## Troubleshooting 'Check Water' Error on Bosch Dishwashers

If you’ve ever encountered the “Check Water” error message on your Bosch dishwasher, you know the frustration of having to figure out how to correct it. Fortunately, this error can usually be easily fixed using a few tips and tricks. This guide will help walk you through the steps required to fix the issue.

The first step is to check the taps which may be connected to the dishwasher to ensure that they are open and running correctly. You should also check the water pressure and make sure that the valves are open and that there is enough pressure to feed the machine.

If there is no issue with the taps or the water pressure, you’ll need to check the water intake filter, located at the bottom of your dishwasher. Remove the filter and clear it of any debris or buildup. If debris or buildup is present, this can block the water from properly entering the machine which can create the “Check Water” error.

The next step is to make sure that the hose is securely connected to the dishwasher and the tap, and that no kinks are present which may prevent the water from entering the dishwasher. If this is all in order, you may want to try a Power Reset. Simply unplug the power supply, wait a few minutes, and then plug it back in and start the dishwasher again.

If these steps still haven't solved the issue, the problem may be due to a component malfunction within the dishwasher’s water valves and pumps. This can be hard to detect and may require a technician to diagnose the issue.

The “Check Water” error can be frustrating, but with just a few simple steps and tricks you can often quickly and easily pinpoint what is causing the issue and have your dishwasher fixed and running again in no time.
