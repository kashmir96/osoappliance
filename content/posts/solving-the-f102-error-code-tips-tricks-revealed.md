## Get to Grips with F102 Error Code and Find the Right Solution 
If your household or kitchen appliance is displaying F102, it's time to take a step back and identify the source of the issue. Fortunately, this error code is relatively easy to tackle with the right tips and tricks. Read on to get clued up on F102 and how to resolve it. 

F102 is typically caused by one of two issues; overheating or thermistor issue. Typically, this error code is associated with a motor malfunction. It might be down to the motor, controller, or even the wires themselves that are causing the issue. 

The first thing you should do to solve the F102 error code is examine the motor. There could be a mechanical issue with the motor which is preventing it from spinning properly. If the motor isn't working, you will likely need to replace it. Additionally, if your appliance isn't fan cooled, that is another potential source of the issue. Additionally, you should also check that the fan is spinning and that there is no blockage causing it to overheat. 

Next, you should check the thermistor. The thermistor helps to measure the air temperature and can cause issues for your appliance. To check if this is the source of your F102 error code, you should strip the motor, find the thermistor and then test it using a multimeter. If the thermistor is faulty, you will need to replace it. 

Finally, you should check the wiring to ensure that it is all functioning properly. If there is a loose or broken wire, this could be the source of the issue and you may need to replace the wires. 

In summary, F102 is an easy problem to tackle with the right tips and tricks. To solve it, check the motor, thermistor and wiring for any issues. If after examination, these all appear fine, then unfortunately you might need to replace the motor or thermistor in order to get your appliance back up and running.

If you've tried the tips and tricks outlined above and you're still struggling to solve the F102 error code, you can contact a local technician from our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to get your appliance back up and running.
