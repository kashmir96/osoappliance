## Resetting the Error Code on Your Samsung Washer
When error codes appear on your Samsung Washer, it can be quite confusing and stressful to try to sort out what it means and how to fix the issue. In this blog, we will walk through the steps you need to take in order to reset your washer and clear the error code. 

Firstly, you should try pressing the Pause/Cancel button twice on the washer. If this resolves the issue, it means that the fault is not a major issue and the code will be reset by itself. 

If the code does not reset when you press the Pause/Cancel button, unplug the washer from the power socket and wait for few minutes before plugging it back in and trying again. This can help to reboot the system and reset any problems that may have occurred due to a minor incident, such as a power cut.

If these methods do not work, you should consult our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to find out what action is required to reset the error. This useful guide provides detailed instructions on how to clear different error codes.

Once you have determined the issue and followed the instructions to reset it, always be sure to double check any connections, tubes, etc., and make sure that they are in their correct positions.

If you have followed these steps and the error has not cleared, then it’s likely that there is a more serious issue with the machine and you should contact a technician or manufacturer for further advice.

In conclusion, clearing error codes on your Samsung Washer can be a tricky process. If you follow the steps outlined in this blog, you should be able to reset the error code yourself. However, if you can’t get the error to reset and you are still having trouble, it is best to call in a specialist or contact the manufacturer for assistance.
