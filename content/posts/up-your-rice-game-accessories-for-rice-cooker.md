## Upping Your Rice Making with Rice Cooker Accessories 
With the huge popularity of the rice cooker, accessories for it have become widely available to help up your rice game. Rice is a staple food for many cultures around the world and most consume it on a daily basis. As such, it's important to have the perfect components to make delicious, fluffy rice whenever you like. Here, we've got a roundup of the best and latest items for your rice cooker to make sure your rice dish is always a success. 

First, let's start with steamer accessories for your cooker. These are useful for adding additional ingredients such as vegetables, fish, and poultry to your cook. Steamer trays are great for making sure all ingredients cook evenly and are not over or undercooked. You can even buy stackable trays so that you can cook multiple ingredients at the same time without overcrowding the pot. 

Next, how about a rice scoop to measure out the perfect amount of cooked rice or a spatula to easily rake rice and mix ingredients? These handy utensils help to make the rice-making process enjoyable as they simplify it so that you don't have to use your hands or other makeshift items. There are also steam diverters for your cooker that are designed to keep your clean-up easier by diverting the escaped steam that is created during the cooking process. 

On top of the cooker accessories there are also handy extra items to make the time spent preparing rice easier. The rice container is a must, as it helps to keep grains of rice separate and stops it from sticking together. The inner pot or inner bowl is also great for preventing oven burns and hot spots on the rice. It's also available in non-stick which makes it super simple to clean. Lastly, there are numerous recipes which can be used for guidance and inspiration for making the perfect rice dish at home. 

Upgrading your rice game does not have to be a daunting task. With these easy-to-use accessories, you can make great-tasting rice every single time. Having the right parts and accessories on hand ensures that youâ€™re prepared and able to create delicious dishes in no time. Need help troubleshooting rice cooker problems?
