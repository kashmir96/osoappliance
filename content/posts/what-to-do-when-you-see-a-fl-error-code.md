## Taking Action When Seeing a FL Error Code
When purchasing a new household appliance, understanding what certain error codes means can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing. One of the most common error codes you may come across is FL. In this blog post, we'll explain what an FL error code is telling you and what steps to take to fix it.

The FL error code usually appears in a display when you are using a washing machine. It typically means there is an issue with the flow sensor in the washer. This is a small device that senses if there is enough water flow coming into the machine. If the flow sensor is malfunctioning, it can cause the washer to not fill with enough water and the FL error code will show on the display.

When confronted with an FL error code, the first step in the troubleshooting process is to check the hoses and make sure the water supply is shut off completely. If the water has completely shut off and the FL error code still appears, then this is most likely an issue with the flow sensor.

In order to replace the malfunctioning flow sensor, you will need to unplug the washing machine from the wall and locate the flow sensor. The flow sensor is generally on the lower left side of the washer and looks like a small black plug. Once unplugged, you can replace the flow sensor with a new one.

If you have been able to identify the issue but don't feel comfortable with performing the repairs yourself, it’s important to reach out to a local appliance repair technician. You can use our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to find the best local technician to help you.

In conclusion, when confronted with an FL error code, the most common cause is a malfunctioning flow sensor. Make sure to check the hoses and water supply in order to make sure the water is turned off completely. If the error code still appear, you will need to replace the flow sensor. Finally, if you need extra help, use our directory to find a local appliance repair technician who can help you.

## Understanding the Different Food Dehydrator Options on the Market
Food dehydration can be an advantageous way to preserve food, as well as create delicious snacks. As more consumers learn the many benefits of using food dehydrators, the market is becoming more saturated with different types of models. By understanding the different types of food dehydrators, it’s possible to find the one that’s the best fit for your needs.

The first thing to consider when looking for the right dehydrator is the size. Most countertop models are 7-9 inches in height, 15-17 inches wide, and 13-15 inches deep. Bigger units are available, but typically only for commercial use. Additionally, consider the interior capacity – may dehydrators range from 2-20 square feet. Some come with separate trays that can be stacked and some come with solid trays which makes it easier to move the food around.

Another major consideration is the wattage output. Generally, the higher the wattage output, the faster the dehydration process. Also, consider the temperature control and timer functions, as this will determine how you can adjust the drying times, types of foods you can make, and the variety of textures you can achieve.

Finally, consider the material of the machine. All are made primarily of plastic, so you can use heat and condensation resistant materials. Because there is not much insulation in the machines themselves, you may want to opt for a steel or aluminum machine that offers better insulation. Also, when looking at different models, make sure that you check for proper air circulation, as some machines may become very hot in the drying process.

By taking the time to evaluate all of these aspects, it’s possible to find the best food dehydrator for your needs. If you’re looking for a reliable appliance repair technician to maintain or repair your food dehydrator, be sure to check out our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians.

## Exploring Different Food Dehydrator Options

1.	What is a food dehydrator? 
A food dehydrator is an appliance that uses air and low temperatures over a period of time to remove moisture from foods to make them last longer. The result is dehydrated food with a texture similar to dried fruits and vegetables.

2. What are the benefits of using a food dehydrator? 
Using a food dehydrator has numerous benefits. It is an easy and efficient way to preserve food for a longer shelf life. Dehydrating food also removes harmful bacteria and other contaminants, making it much safer to consume. Additionally, dehydrating food can reduce its size and weight, making it easier to transport and store. 

3. What types of food can I dehydrate? 
Most types of food can be dehydrated, including fruits, vegetables, herbs, nuts, and meats.

4. What considerations should I take into account when choosing a food dehydrator? 
When choosing a food dehydrator, you should consider factors such as the size of the food dehydrator, the wattage, the temperature range, the number of shelves or trays, the noise level, and the overall design. You should also consider factors such as ease of use, capacity, and cleaning.

5. What is the difference between an electric food dehydrator and a solar food dehydrator? 
An electric food dehydrator uses electricity to heat and circulate air to dehydrate food. A solar food dehydrator uses the sun’s energy to do the same. Electric food dehydrators are typically more efficient, while solar food dehydrators tend to be better for the environment.

## Key Takeaways
1. Decide on the size, interior capacity and wattage output when choosing the right food dehydrator.
2. Temperature, timer settings and air circulation are important for controlling the dehydration process and achieving desired textures.
3. Consider the materials of the machine - plastic, steel or aluminum, depending on heat and condensation resistance.
4. Evaluate all aspects of a food dehydrator before choosing the one that's best suited for your needs.
5. Appliance repair technicians can help maintain and repair food dehydrators."
