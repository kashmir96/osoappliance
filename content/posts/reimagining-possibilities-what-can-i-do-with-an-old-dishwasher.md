## Reimagine What an Old Dishwasher Can Do

Old appliances may seem like a drag since they take up space, but they don’t have to be tossed in the trash. Reimagining obsolete kitchen appliances like a dishwasher can be a great way to get some extra use out of them. Instead of throwing a dishwasher away, repurpose it into something useful and creative. Here are some ideas to help you get more use out of an old dishwasher.

One creative option is to make a planter box. With a few simple materials, anyone can turn an old dishwasher into beautiful and functional planter box. These planter boxes can be used as growing boxes for herbs or small vegetables. You can also add a linoleum material at the bottom to make it easier to clean. 

A fun repurposing idea is to turn it into a bar. A bar dishwasher is a neat space-saving option as it can function both as a bar and as a dishwasher. Simply add liquor bottles and a small refrigerator to store snacks, drinks, and ice. This unique setup would make for a perfect basement-party station.

Other ideas include making a dishwasher into a multifunctional storage unit or even a hidden pet house. This can be a great way to hide a pet house in your kitchen and help the pet feel at home. You can also dress up the dishwasher with a fresh paint job, keeping the same color theme as the kitchen for a seamless look, or painting it in a fun color for a unique, vibrant design.

No matter how you decide to repurpose an old dishwasher, it will be a project that helps reduce waste. Old dishwashers can be recycled, but they can also be given a new life and purpose. Not only that, but you will have a chance to be creative and design a one-of-a-kind piece that you can use in your home.
