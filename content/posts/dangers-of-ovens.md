Ovens are an essential part of modern cooking, but they can also be very dangerous. Ovens generate high temperatures that can easily cause burns, start fires and even create poisonous gases. Here are a few ways to reduce the risks associated with ovens:

1. Be aware of what is happening in the oven at all times. Never leave food unattended while it is cooking in the oven, as this could lead to fires or other dangerous situations. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby just in case it is needed.

2. Make sure that all safety devices on your oven are functioning properly. This includes the thermostat which should be set at a safe temperature and monitored regularly to ensure it isn’t too hot or too cold for what you are cooking.

3. When using self-cleaning functions on your oven, use caution and make sure all flammable materials such as rugs and curtains are moved away from the area around the oven to avoid accidents caused by sparks or heat transferring to them during cleaning cycles. 

4. If your gas stove has pilot lights, be sure they remain lit at all times so gas does not accumulate in your kitchen when the burners aren’t being used for long periods of time or when you forget to turn them off after use but still let them run out of fuel anyway.. This can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning which can be deadly if left unchecked for too long. 
 
5 .Check for frayed wires and exposed parts on electric stoves before each use; damaged wiring increases risk of fire dramatically and should always be fixed immediately if found . Don't forget about any cords running from appliance into wall outlets either - these need checking as well! 

 With proper care and caution taken when operating an oven, you can help protect yourself from injury or worse while still enjoying delicious meals cooked in your own kitchen!
