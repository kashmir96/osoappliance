## Electric Heat Pumps vs Tankless Water Heaters: What's Best for Your Home?

Deciding what type of water heater to install in your home can be a difficult decision. The two main options are electric heat pump water heaters and tankless water heaters, both of which have their own unique benefits and drawbacks. In this blog, we'll provide an overview of the similarities and differences between the two so you can better determine the best fit for your home's needs. 

Electric heat pump water heaters use electricity to move heat from one area to another. They are especially efficient when used in a temperate climate, as the heat can come from outside air as opposed to strictly using electric energy. This makes electric heat pumps a highly efficient solution, reducing your energy bills and also providing heating in more extreme climates. Despite their efficiency, one downside of electric heat pumps is that they are relatively expensive.

On the other hand, tankless water heaters use gas to heat water as it passes through a series of coils. This is a much more cost-efficient option, as gas is cheaper than electricity. Additionally, tankless water heaters take up less space than a traditional water heater, making them a great choice for smaller homes. However, tankless water heaters are only able to heat a limited amount of water at a time, making them less ideal for larger households.

Ultimately, the choice between an electric heat pump water heater and a tankless water heater should come down to your location and budget. If you live in a temperate climate with an electric-powered energy system, an electric heat pump water heater is the more energy-efficient and cost-effective option. Alternatively, if you live in an area without access to electric-powered energy, a tankless water heater is a great option.
