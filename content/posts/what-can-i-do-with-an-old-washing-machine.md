# What can i do with an old washing machine

If your old washing machine is still in good working condition, the best thing you can do is donate it to a family in need. In today’s world, many people struggle to afford basic necessities like a washing machine. Donating your old washing machine to a family in need is an incredibly generous and rewarding act.

If the washing machine is beyond repair, there are still plenty of ways you can put it to use. For example, you can use it as a planter. Simply fill the machine with soil and plant your favorite flowers or herbs. This is a great way to add a unique touch to your garden.

You can also repurpose the washing machine into a storage unit. You can use it to store items like sports equipment, extra blankets, and even toys. This is a great option if you’re looking for an inexpensive storage solution.

Finally, you can use the washing machine as a decor piece. Paint the outside of the machine and add some decorations to make it look unique. You can even add some lights or wheels to turn it into a one-of-a-kind piece of furniture.

No matter what you decide to do with your old washing machine, you’ll be giving it a new life and helping the environment. It’s a win-win situation!
