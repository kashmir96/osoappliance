## Error! What to Do When Your Washing Machine Says something unusual
When at home using a washing machine, no one plans for an error. Washing machines can malfunction sooner or later, and when it does you may be presented with an error code or bizarre sound. Knowing what to do when your washing machine says something unusual is key to resolving any glitches in your washing process.

The first step to take is to identify the problem by understanding the error code or sound your washing machine has given. If your washing machine has illuminated with a light or digital error code, use your washer's user manual for reference, or consult an [appliance error codes glossary](./error-codes/). Understanding what the error code means is the initial step to solve the issue.

If your washing machine has given you an odd sound, hire a technician to diagnose what is going wrong, they will provide the best advice and a replacement part if needed. If your washing machine is still in warranty, take advantage of the warranty provided by the manufacturer to cover the repair costs.

To avoid potential errors from happening in the future, regularly run a maintenance cycle to ensure all components are operable. If you have an older washing machine, regularly check for any leaking or strange sounds coming from the unit. Finally, keep all parts free of dust and lint to ensure the interior is kept clean and free of debris build-up.

When facing an issue with your washing machine, keep calm and take the necessary steps to diagnose and resolve the issue. With a full understanding of the process, you can fix the issue with greater ease and less stress.
