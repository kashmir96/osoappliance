Kettles make noise as a result of water boiling inside them. As the water heats up, steam is produced and it pushes its way out of the spout or lid of the kettle. The force of the steam escaping creates a loud whistling sound which is amplified by the metal body of the kettle.

This noise serves an important purpose in that it lets us know when our water has reached boiling point and is ready to use for tea or coffee. Without this sound, we wouldn’t be able to tell when our water had reached its ideal temperature, so kettles are designed with this whistling sound in mind.

The amount of noise produced by a kettle can vary depending on factors such as how full it is, what material it’s made from and how powerful its element is. Generally speaking, though, all kettles will make some kind of audible sound when their water boils – alerting us to the fact that our drink is now ready!
