## Know What to Look For Before Purchasing a General Electric Range Hood 
A range hood is an incredibly convenient appliance to have in the kitchen, providing ventilation and lighting to your cooktop when in use. A General Electric range hood is an especially nice choice; they provide a variety of features and styles, so you can select the one that's perfect for your kitchen. 

Before investing in a General Electric range hood, be sure to consider factors such as cost, size, and installation needs. Price and size will likely depend on the type of fan and fan speed, as well as the exterior finish you chose for your hood. You'll also want to decide whether you’ll be installing the hood yourself or hiring a professional. Reach out to a local dealer to get an accurate measurement of the space between cabinets and your cooktop. 

When it comes to cost, General Electric range hoods have a great range. Their models vary in price, but you'll get the same quality that you would expect from any General Electric product. Higher priced models will usually feature more powerful fan speeds, additional lighting, and more advanced upgrades. 

Once you've determined the proper size and selected the hood that fits your budget, installation considerations come next. Depending on the size of your kitchen and the type of hood chosen, you'll likely need to hire a professional for installation. However, it’s possible that you could opt for a do-it-yourself installation if you’re up for a challenge and feel comfortable doing the work.
