## Unravelling The E8 Error Code On Washing Machines
Are you a proud user of a washing machine and have been noticing strange flashing lights and an 'E8' message on the digital display? Have no fear, this guide will unravel the mystery of the E8 code and help you get back to washing clean clothes.

When an E8 error code is displayed it means that your washing machine is having an issue with its water pump. This is not a call for alarm, and can usually be fixed with a few easy steps.

First, ensure that the water supply to the washing machine has not been disconnected or stopped up, as this could be the issue. If the water supply is working correctly, then the error code might be due to the pressure switch being blocked or not operating correctly. Check that it is operating correctly, or a service technician can be called to assist in this matter.

Another cause of the error code could be a blocked drain hose or pump. Check the hose and the pump for any clogs or blockages that could be preventing the water from draining correctly and causing the error code.

Lastly, the error code E8 may be due to a faulty wiring connection or circuit board error. In this case, it is best to call a service technician to come and check the connections.

An E8 error code is nothing to panic about, it just means that the washing machine is having an issue with the water supply or pressure switch, or that a blockage in the drain or pump is preventing the water from draining correctly.
