## Improving Air Quality With An Improved AC Unit

When the summertime hits, it is incredibly important for us to keep our homes cool and our air quality high with the aid of a functioning air conditioning unit (AC). Unfortunately, it can be quite common for some ACs to become unclean and gather dirt, dust, and other allergens. Not only can this be bad for our health, but it can also cause a decrease in efficiency and longevity of our appliance. 

Luckily, it is possible to ‘breathe easier’ with a clean air conditioning unit. Routinely maintaining our AC unit is key to reduce the amount of dirt, dust, and allergens that can be released into the air, and thus improve the air quality in our homes. This can be done through a number of ways; such as dusting the vents, changing the air filter regularly, and cleaning the drainage system. Additionally, it is important to check for mold growth around and behind the unit; if present, it is likely that this needs to be professionally removed to avoid further contamination of the air in the home. 

Another way to ensure a breathable, healthier home is to consider the ACs that you buy in the first place. By seeking out models that are Energy Star certified, you are likely to experience an improvement in energy efficiency, as well as reduced dust and dirt levels.

In conclusion, if we are conscious about our air conditioner, we can be more confident in the air that we are breathing in our homes. Regular maintenance and seeking out appropriate models can be a great benefit to both our health and budget. If you are not sure on the best way to maintain your AC unit or are experiencing problems that you are unable to diagnose yourself, it may be best to contact a professional. Our [directory of appliance repair technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) provides specialist advice to help you keep your AC in the best condition.
