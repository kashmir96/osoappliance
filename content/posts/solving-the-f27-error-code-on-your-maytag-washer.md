## Troubleshooting the f27 Error Code on Maytag Washers
With our household appliances, nothing is more inconvenient than when something goes wrong. Especially since so many of us depend on these machines everyday. A common issue that can arise with one of the leading brands in laundry, Maytag, is the F27 error code. If this is something you’ve already encountered, we’re here to help.

The F27 error code indicates an issue with the drive motor. This could be caused by an overload due to a large load, something blocking the drive motor or failure of the drive motor itself. 

If you have noticed the error code, you can try the following steps to troubleshoot:

- Check for any visible blockages near the washer.
- Unplug the appliance for 10-15 minutes before plugging it back in.
- Then attempt to run a cycle.

If you have attempted these steps, and the error code persists, it could indicate an internal motor failure.
