## Upgrade Your Kitchen with Hoods for All Types of Kitchens
Are you looking for a new kitchen hood for your home? A kitchen hood is an essential addition to any kitchen, as it removes unwanted odors, steam and smoke from the cooking area. Depending on the size of your kitchen and the cooking activities you typically perform, there are hoods that are made to fit all types of kitchens. 

When it comes to kitchen hoods, there are a variety of styles to choose from, such as island hoods, cabinet hoods, wall-mounted hoods, lateral-mounted hoods and vent hoods. When shopping for a kitchen hood, be sure to consider the type of kitchen you have and choose accordingly. Island hoods are great for larger kitchens with no walls that provide an additional work surface. Cabinet hoods are usually fixed under the cabinet and they are ideal for smaller kitchens. Additionally, wall-mounted hoods take up less space than island or cabinet units and they are made to fit cabinets with mounting rail-systems and adjustable mounting brackets.

In terms of ventilation, there are two types of hoods: ducted and recirculating. A ducted hood filters grease, smoke, moisture and other odors through the duct system and out of the home. While a recirculating hood filters the air and blows the exhaust back into the kitchen. This type of hood is best for small kitchens and for those who don’t have an exhaust system that can be used.

No matter what type of kitchen you have, there’s a hood for it. To ensure that you find the best one for your home, take time to research the different types of kitchen hoods available. Doing so will keep your kitchen looking great and smelling fresh. 

When selecting the right kitchen hood for your space, it pays to use certified appliances and professionals that you can trust. Refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to learn more about kitchen appliance safety and repair. Get the most out of your kitchen with a hood that is designed to meet your cooking and ventilation needs.

## Expanding Your Choice Range with Hoods for Your Kitchen

Q1: What types of kitchen hoods are available?

A1: Kitchen hoods are available in a variety of types including under-cabinet, wall-mounted, island, downdraft, and ceiling-mounted hoods. Many of these come in different sizes, colors, and materials, so you can find a hood to fit your kitchen style and needs. 

Q2: How do I choose a kitchen hood that fits my kitchen style?

A2: When selecting your kitchen hood, consider the type of hood that will work best for your space, the size of your kitchen and the location of existing ductwork, and also the materials, color, and design of the hood. Aesthetics should be given consideration as well to ensure your kitchen hood blends in with your kitchen's overall style. 

Q3: What should I look for in a kitchen hood?

A3: When selecting a kitchen hood for your kitchen, look for one that meets your needs for size, function, and installation. Also make sure to select a hood with an appropriate CFM (cubic feet per minute), which is the measure of the amount of air the hood can move. Selecting a hood with a higher CFM will ensure better air circulation in your kitchen. 

Q4: How is a kitchen hood installed?

A4: Installation of a kitchen hood depends on the type of hood. Under-cabinet hoods require mounting brackets and other hardware, while wall-mounted hoods require mounting to joists. Island and ceiling-mounted hoods require more advanced installation, typically involving the coordination of electrical and ductwork elements. It is recommended that professional installation is sought so as to ensure correct installation. 

Q5: How do I keep my kitchen hood clean?

A5: It is important to clean your kitchen hood regularly to remove dirt, grease, dust, and other debris. You should also check and replace filters in the hood according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Disconnect power to the hood before cleaning and wash the hood using mild soap and water, followed by a rinse. Apply commercial degreaser to tougher areas, scrub lightly and then rinse.
