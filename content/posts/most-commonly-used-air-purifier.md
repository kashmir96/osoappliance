Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular as people become more aware of the dangers of air pollutants. An air purifier is a device that removes harmful particles from the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and other allergens. Air purifiers can help reduce allergies and asthma symptoms, help you breathe better, and improve your overall health.

When choosing an air purifier for your home or office, there are several types to consider. The most common type is a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter. This type of filter traps particles in the air using a mesh or paper-like material that has tiny pores. These pores capture particles larger than 0.3 microns in size (a micron is one millionth of a meter). HEPA filters are very effective at catching pet dander, mold spores, dust mites, cigarette smoke and other types of airborne contaminants.

Another type of air purifier is an activated carbon filter. Activated carbon filters work by trapping gases and odors in its porous surface area made up of millions of tiny holes called “pores” which measure between 0.3 to 1 nanometer in size (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). These filters also absorb airborne chemicals such as formaldehyde and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). Activated carbon filters can be used alone or combined with other filtration technologies for additional benefits such as odor control or removal of gaseous pollutants from the indoor environment.

Finally, ultraviolet light (UV) technology has been proven to be an effective method for killing bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms present in the home environment without producing any ozone or chemical byproducts like some other technologies may do so it's great for those with allergies or asthma sensitivities who need extra protection from these potentially harmful agents floating around their living space . UV light works by damaging microorganism’s DNA structure which makes it impossible for them to reproduce and spread which helps keep your indoor environment much cleaner! 

No matter what type you choose though -- all three types mentioned above will help reduce airborne contaminants within your home making it healthier place to live!
