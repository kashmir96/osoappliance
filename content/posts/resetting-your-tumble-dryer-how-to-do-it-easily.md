## Easily Resetting Your Tumble Dryer 
It can be frustrating when your appliances suddenly stop working! The good news is there are quite a few things you can try to help get your Tumble Dryer working again. Resetting your Tumble Dryer is a relatively simple process and can sometimes resolve the issue. 

To start you will want to turn off the Tumble Dryer and unplug it from the wall socket. After doing this you can disconnect the appliance from the exhaust vent or hose (depending on the model). Once everything is disconnected, you can start the reset process. 

The first step of resetting is to remove the plug from the wall and press the reset button located in the back or side of the appliance. The exact location of the reset button will vary depending on the model, though it should be easy to find. Once you have pressed the reset button, you can plug it back in followed by reconnecting the exhaust vent or hose.

The next step is to power on the appliance and hold the start button while at the same time pressing the power button fifteen times. This should allow the appliance to reset. 

Your Tumble Dryer should now be reset, however if it still doesn't work you may have a deeper issue. If this is the case you may need to take a look at the error codes to determine what the issue is.
