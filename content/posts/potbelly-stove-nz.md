A potbelly stove is an iconic piece of kiwi culture and a style of woodburner that has been around for many years. It’s a traditional home heating solution that radiates warmth throughout the room and creates an inviting atmosphere. 

Potbellys are designed to burn wood, although they can also be used with coal and pellets. They come in a variety of sizes and styles, ranging from small models to large industrial-sized units. The most popular being the ‘standard’ potbelly which is usually round or oval in shape, with a large firebox at the bottom and a chimney on top. 

Potbelly stoves have several advantages over other woodheat systems. Firstly, they are extremely efficient; their compact design allows them to heat up quickly and retain their heat for longer periods of time than other types of stoves or fireplaces. Secondly, they are relatively low maintenance; all you need to do is keep your chimney clean and stock up on firewood! Lastly, they produce very little smoke emissions compared to open fires or coal-burning stoves, making them an environmentally friendly choice for your home heating needs. 

Potbelly stoves can be found in many Kiwi homes all over New Zealand – from rural properties to city apartments – adding warmth and character wherever they go! Whether you’re looking for an old-fashioned centrepiece for your living room or just wanting something reliable and efficient, these classic pieces of kiwiana are sure to fit the bill!
