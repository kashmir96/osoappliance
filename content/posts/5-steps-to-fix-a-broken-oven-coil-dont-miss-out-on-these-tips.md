## Fixing a Broken Oven Coil Easily

Having an oven that's not working correctly can be incredibly inconvenient, especially if you rely on it for daily tasks. One of the more common issues with ovens is a broken coil, which can lead to malfunction and burnt food. In this blog, we'll review five simple steps for fixing a broken oven coil.

### Step 1: Check the Power and Cords

The first thing you should do is to check the power and cords of your oven. Make sure that the power cord is plugged in correctly and that there is a steady flow of power getting to the unit.

### Step 2: Test the Heating Element

Once you have made sure that the power is on and running, you should then test the heating element. You can do this by putting an oven thermometer into the oven and turning it on. If there is no change in temperature or the temperature remains low, then the heating element has likely died.

### Step 3: Replace the Heating Element

If the heating element needs to be replaced then you will need to remove the old one and replace it with a new one. Make sure you turn off all power to the oven before doing this.

### Step 4: Clean the Oven

Once the heating element has been replaced, it is important to clean the entirety of the oven. This will help to prevent any further damage and will ensure the oven runs efficiently.

### Step 5: Check the Heating Element

Finally, take the time to check the new heating element and make sure it is functioning properly. You can do this by using an oven thermometer to check if the temperature is rising. If the temperature is steadily rising, then the new heating element is working. 

By taking these five steps, you can easily and effectively fix a broken oven coil. Make sure that you are careful when handling the heating element and that you never work on electrical appliances with wet hands.
