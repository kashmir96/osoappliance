Also check the range wiring harness in the back of the oven. Make sure that the wire connectors are still securely attached with no visual damage and that all the wires are tight. If you find any damage, contact a repairman for further work on the oven.

If all checks out well, it’s time to reset the system. To do this, try disconnecting the power from the oven for a few seconds, then reconnect and try again. You can also turn the oven off, wait 15 seconds and then turn it back on the reset the system. Keep in mind that you may have to reset the clock on the oven after this.
