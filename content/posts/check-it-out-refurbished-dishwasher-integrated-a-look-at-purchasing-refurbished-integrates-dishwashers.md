Often, these appliances are made from existing components that have been tested for functionality and reliability and then restored to their original condition. This can help to ensure that you are getting a fully operational dishwasher at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, there are extended warranties available on some refurbished integrated dishwashers in the event that there is a product defect or malfunction.
