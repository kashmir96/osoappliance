## Resetting a Bosch Dishwasher Error Code
Having an appliance like a dishwasher can make life easier, but should your Bosch dishwasher ever suffer from a problem or breakdown, it can be very annoying. Error codes display on your Bosch dishwasher display panel when there is an issue, and in this blog, we'll look at the steps needed for you to reset any error code.

The first thing to check is the dishwasher's filter system which can require regular cleaning, instead of the need for a technical fix. To check the filter, open the filter cover at the bottom of the dishwasher, then pull out the lower filter and remove any food debris, reassemble and close the filter cover.

If, after checking the filter system, the error code flashes this could indicate a fault in the electronic circuit board. If this is the case, you need to replace the electronic board either yourself, or with the help of a qualified engineer. 

For a more serious issue, resetting the Bosch dishwasher using the following steps may help:

- Press and hold the start/stop button for three seconds.
- On the Machine select audio on by using the multifunctional select button, press the button repeatedly until you reach the audio on setting. 
- Now press the Start/stop button once more
- Enter the service mode to do so hold down the program button for three seconds.
- Now press the program and delay start buttons together for three seconds.
- Now turn on the power by pressing the on/off button; the dishwasher should now be in a reset position and the error code should disappear. 

After resetting the Bosch dishwasher be sure to check all hoses and connections to the appliance to ensure that no blockage is stopping the dishwasher from draining correctly.

It is always recommended to follow manufacturer guidelines and user manuals to ensure that your appliance can be repaired safely, however, if you are unsure of how to reset your Bosch dishwasher or any other home appliance, then it's best to always get help from a qualified engineer.
