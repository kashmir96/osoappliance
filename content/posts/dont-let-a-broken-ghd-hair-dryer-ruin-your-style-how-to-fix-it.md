## Don't Let Your Style Suffer from a Broken GHD Hair Dryer
No one likes it when their beauty routine is disrupted, so when your GHD hair dryer stops working it can be a huge inconvenience and disrupt your style. Luckily, fixing a GHD hair dryer is often a fairly straightforward and inexpensive process, and in no time you can have your hair dryer and your style back on track.

There are two primary sources of a broken GHD hair dryer: either the motor is damaged, or there is a defect within the electronic circuit. If the motor is damaged, it will create a loud and persistent noise. In this case, the motor needs to be replaced – a repair which may be able to be done by an appliance repair technician. 

If you’re dealing with an electronic defect, then chances are it can be fixed without needing to replace any parts. The issue can most likely be traced and fixed by determining which connection is not functioning. You can have a professional technician assess this and fix the issue, or if you’re confident, then you can undertake the repair process yourself.

It’s important to note that this type of repair is best undertaken once you have unplugged your hair dryer and are no longer using it. This will reduce the possibility of danger due to electric shock. Undertaking electronic repairs can also void your warranty, but don’t let that put you off. Once you’ve seen that this is the best option for a repair, then it is often worth it.

Once you’ve determined the cause and are comfortable with undertaking the repair, it is a good idea to make sure you have the parts and tools you'll need for the job. Additionally, it can be helpful to read over the GHD hair dryer manual, which often contains details of the unit and how it functions, which can be beneficial when trying to identify the cause of the issue.

It is important to note that while GHD hair dryers are durable and generally easy to repair, you may find it difficult to find parts to purchase as GHD often only distribute parts to certified technicians. Nevertheless, with the right parts and the right resources, a broken GHD hair dryer doesn't have to disrupt your style.
