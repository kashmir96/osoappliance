A rice cooker is a kitchen appliance used to boil or steam rice. It consists of a heat source, an inner cooking bowl, and a thermostat. The thermometer measures the temperature of the cooking bowl and controls the heat. When the rice has finished cooking, the thermostat switches off the heat to keep it from overcooking.

Rice cookers are becoming increasingly popular as they can be used to prepare a variety of dishes such as risotto, oatmeal, soups, stews, and even cakes and muffins! Rice cookers can also be used to cook grains other than just rice including quinoa and millet. 

The most popular types of rice cookers are electric models that use induction heating or pressure cooking technology for faster results. These models range from basic ones with just an on/off switch to more advanced ones with digital displays that allow you to set timers and customize settings for different types of grains. 

When selecting a rice cooker itâ€™s important to consider your budget and needs since prices vary greatly depending on features such as size and capability. In general though, electric pressure cookers tend to be more expensive than conventional electric models but offer more convenience since they require less time spent monitoring the cooking process. 

No matter which type you choose though, having a reliable rice cooker will make meal preparation easier while saving time in your busy schedule!
