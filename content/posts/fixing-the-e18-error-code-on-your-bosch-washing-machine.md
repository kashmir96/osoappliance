## Troubleshooting the E18 Error Code on Your Bosch Washing Machine
Are you experiencing an **E18** error code when you run your Bosch washing machine? Do you want to know how to resolve the problem? If so, you’ve come to the right place. In this blog post, we’ll be explaining how to effectively troubleshoot the E18 error code and hopefully get your Bosch washing machine running perfectly again. 

The **E18** error code usually appears on the Bosch washing machine’s display when there’s an issue with the door locking or unlocking mechanism. This could be caused by blocked door hoses, a loose or broken door handle, or a faulty door lock. It’s worth double checking that there’s nothing blocking the hoses or blocking the lock before making any repairs as this can occasionally fix the issue.

If the above method doesn't work, then you’ll likely need to purchase a new door wiring harness. This harness connects the machine’s capacitive or physical door lock to the Bosch main board and is responsible for the locking and unlocking of the washing machine door. Luckily, it doesn’t require any specialist tools so you may be able to replace it yourself. 

If you’re unable to do this, or simply want to save yourself the hassle, then you can always call a skilled appliance repair technician. They can come to your home and replace the harness in no time. 

To do this, check out our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for reliable professionals. 

In conclusion, the **E18** error code can be a frustrating issue to experience with your Bosch washing machine but, as we’ve seen, it’s relatively easy to fix. Make sure to check the hoses and handles before buying a new wiring harness and, if you do need to buy one, be sure to call an experienced repair technician to save you time and money.
