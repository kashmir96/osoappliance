## Unplugging a Freezer for 2 Hours â€“ What Are The Implications?
When it comes to kitchen appliances, the freezer is one of the key ones in every household. Its ability to preserve food over long periods of time makes sure that meals stay fresh, especially useful for those days when cooking is not feasible. But are there any implications from unplugging the freezer for 2 hours? In this blog we will discuss the impact of unplugging a freezer for 2 hours.

First and foremost, it is important to note that your freezer was designed for hours of operation. During the 2 hours of unplugging the appliance, the temperature inside the freezer will start to increase. This can cause the food already stored inside to start deteriorating slowly but surely. As such, it is advised against unplugging the freezer for more than 2 hours as the food may end up spoiling. 

On the other hand, a freezer's efficiency is noticeable in more than just food preservation. Having the freezer plugged in can help drive down the energy costs of the entire house. As such, unplugging the freezer for 2 hours and then plugging it in again might result in a net energy increase that may take a while to go away. This is because the power surge will take some time to return to normalacy. 

Finally, it is worth mentioning that when plugging the freezer back in, the user should be careful and avoid getting any type of shock. After having been off for 2 hours, it is possible for the inside of the freezer to be wet or have grease and water spilled on it. As such, it is advisible for users to wear gloves and have a grounded outlet to plug in the freezer. 

In conclusion, unplugging a freezer for 2 hours is doable. However, it is important to note the implications it has on food preservation, energy consumption and user safety.
