As appliances become increasingly commonplace in our homes, it is important to understand how long they should last. Knowing the expected lifespan of a particular appliance can help you plan for when to replace it, as well as give you a better idea of what to look for when shopping for a new one.

Consumer NZ is an independent, non-profit organisation dedicated to providing consumers with unbiased and objective information on products and services. As part of their work, they have put together an informative guide to the expected life expectancy of common appliances in New Zealand households. 

This guide includes estimates on the average lifespan of different types of appliances in years: 
• Refrigerators – 10-15 years 
• Ovens – 8-13 years 
• Ranges – 14-20 years 
• Dishwashers – 9-12 years 
• Washers/Dryers – 10-15 years 
• Garbage Disposals – 12+years 

It is important to note that these figures are only averages and some individual models may last longer or shorter depending on how well they are maintained and used. Appliances that are regularly serviced should last longer than those that are not, so be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for maintenance and cleaning. Additionally, if you are purchasing a new appliance, look for models with higher Energy Star ratings -- this can also increase its lifespan significantly by reducing energy consumption over time. 

Keep in mind that appliances typically become less efficient as they age due to wear and tear on parts such as seals, gaskets and other components which can lead them to consume more energy than when they were new. This means that although your older appliance may still be functioning properly, it could be costing you more money in utilities each month than if you had invested in a newer model with better efficiency ratings. 

Overall, understanding the estimated life expectancy of your home’s appliances is an important factor when determining when or whether replacement is necessary or cost effective -- especially if you want your investment to pay off over time!
