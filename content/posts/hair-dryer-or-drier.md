The correct spelling is Hair Dryer. A hair dryer (sometimes known as a blow dryer) is an electrical device used to dry and style hair. It uses warm air to evaporate the water from wet hair, speeding up the styling process. Hair dryers are available in a range of sizes, shapes and styles, with different features such as adjustable heat settings and multiple speeds.

Hair dryers have been around since the early 1900s, when they were powered by vacuum cleaners and electric motors. Today, most hair dryers are powered by electricity and use ceramic elements to generate heat more efficiently than traditional heating elements. They also feature ionic technology which helps reduce frizz and flyaways while locking in moisture for healthier-looking hair.

When using a hairdryer, it’s important to adjust the temperature setting according to your hair type; fine or damaged hair should be dried on low or cool settings while thicker or coarser types can handle higher temperatures without harm. You should also select the appropriate speed setting depending on how much volume you want your style to have—faster speeds will add more lift but can make it harder to control your look. Additionally, if you’re using a diffuser attachment that creates air pockets around your curls for extra volume, make sure it is placed close enough to your scalp so that it doesn’t create too much heat in one place—this could damage both your scalp and your style! 

Hairdryers are essential tools for creating salon-worthy looks at home—whether you’re aiming for sleek straight styles or voluminous curls—so make sure you have one that suits all your needs before starting any styling session!
