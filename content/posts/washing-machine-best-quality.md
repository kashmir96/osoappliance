Are you in the market for a new washing machine? With so many options available, it can be difficult to decide which one is right for you. To help you make an informed decision, here’s a look at some of the best features to look for when shopping for a washing machine.

1. Durability: A durable washing machine is important for any home, as it will be used frequently and needs to withstand regular wear and tear. Look for machines made from high-quality materials such as stainless steel or porcelain-coated steel that are designed to last longer than cheaper alternatives. Some models also come with warranties or extended guarantees that can offer further peace of mind. 

2. Capacity: Washing machines come in different sizes, so make sure to check how much laundry each model can hold before making your purchase. The best models are typically larger capacity machines that can handle more clothes in one cycle, saving time and energy overall. 

3. Settings: Modern washing machines have settings tailored specifically towards different fabric types and cycles, like specific settings for cotton or wool clothing items or even heavy-duty cycles designed to tackle tougher dirt and stains on clothes like jeans or towels. Look out for these features when choosing your new machine – they'll ensure your clothes get the care they need! 

4 Energy Efficiency: Saving energy not only helps the environment but also reduces your utility bills each month – so energy efficiency should definitely be taken into account when buying a new washing machine! Look out for Energy Star certified models that have been tested by independent organizations and proved to use less energy than their non-certified counterparts during operation; this could mean considerable savings over time! 

5 Price: Of course, price is always an important factor when making any purchase – but don’t let it be the only criterion when buying a new washing machine! Consider all of the above features (as well as any additional bells & whistles) before settling on one model over another; this way you’ll end up getting more bang for your buck in the long run! 

All in all, there are many features to consider when purchasing a new washing machine. Make sure you know what type of fabrics you’ll be washing most often and look out for machines with durable materials, large capacities, custom settings, energy efficiency and competitive prices. With the right model, your laundry days will be much more efficient and cost-effective!
