Air conditioning is a technological marvel that keeps us cool and comfortable in the summer months. But while it may be a blessing to beat the summer heat, air conditioning can have some unintended consequences on our health. Here are some of the effects of air conditioning on human health:

1. Respiratory Issues: Air conditioners blow out cold air which can cause irritation to your nose, throat, and lungs. The combination of dust particles and allergens in conditioned air can aggravate asthma symptoms or lead to sinus infections in those who are already sensitive to airborne contaminants. 

2. Dehydration: Cold air from an AC unit can dry out your nasal passages—which leads to dehydration since you’re less likely to reach for a glass of water when feeling chilly. This can leave you feeling fatigued by the end of the day and make it harder for your body to fight off infection-causing bacteria or viruses. 

3. Sleep Troubles: While ACs help us stay cool during hot nights, they may also disrupt our sleep patterns by causing our body temperature to dip too low at night—a phenomenon known as thermoregulation disorder or TSD. Symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, broken sleep patterns, and excessive sweating during slumber hours—all of which can leave you feeling tired throughout the day! 

4. Eye Irritation: Air conditioners tend release small amounts of pollutants like formaldehyde into indoor spaces that may lead to eye irritation or allergic reactions such as redness, itching, burning sensations or watery eyes over time if left unchecked! 

In conclusion, if you’re using an AC unit at home or at work make sure take precautions such as opening windows for ventilation every once in awhile; washing filters regularly; setting temperature no lower than 68 degrees Fahrenheit; and investing in high quality filters that don’t allow dust particles into conditioned spaces! Taking these simple steps will go a long way towards protecting your health from any adverse effects that come with using an AC unit!
