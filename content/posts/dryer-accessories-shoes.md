When it comes to doing laundry, the dryer is just as important as the washer. But what about those extra items that turn your drying experience into a whole new level of convenience? Dryer accessories like shoe racks can make life so much easier.

Dryer shoes are a great way to keep your footwear from getting tangled in the drum, and also help protect them from damage caused by heat or agitation. They usually come in a set of two and fit snugly around each shoe, creating pockets for each one individually. This not only helps keep your shoes tangle-free but also ensures that they get dried evenly throughout and with less wear-and-tear than if they were thrown in directly with the rest of the clothes. 

Another great thing about dryer shoe accessories is that you can use them to hang up other items such as delicate fabrics, which should never be put into a dryer on their own due to their delicate nature. By using these specialised racks you’re able to create extra space inside your machine so you can fit more towels or garments at once. They also provide support for more awkwardly shaped items like gloves or hats which may otherwise slide around too much while drying and cause damage over time due to friction against metal surfaces inside the dryer drum. 

Finally, some models even come with an added bonus feature - adjustable feet! This allows you to raise or lower each rack depending on how high (or low) your clothing needs to be during drying cycles for best results—maximizing efficiency and preventing any accidental shrinkage! So no matter what type of footwear you have — running shoes sneakers boots – having a set of these handy little gadgets is sure to make laundry day infinitely easier!
