## All You Need to Know About Dryer Wiring
 Having a dryer in your home is essential to keeping your laundry clean. Without a dryer, you'd need to hang your wet clothes in the sun to dry, which can take up to a full day in the sun. With electrical wiring, you can easily and quickly ensure your dryer is working safely and efficiently. Here is a DIY guide to the electrical wiring that goes into a dryer. 

To wire your dryer correctly, you'll need to identify the wires and terminal screws. The two "hot" wires go to the terminal screws on the ends of each side of your dryer. The third wire, the "grounded neutral," goes to the middle terminal screw. Make sure you attach the appropriate colored grounding wire to the green grounding screw. 

The other two wires you need to identify are the "black" and "red" wires. The black wire is the "hot" and the red wire is the "grounded neutral." Wiring your dryer requires attaching the green wire to the green grounding screw and the black and red wires to the terminal screws on the sides of the dryer. To attach the wires, twist them onto the end of the terminal screws and then tighten. 

Once you've installed the wiring, you'll need to attach the power cord to the back of the dryer. To do this, you'll need to first determine the wire colors. Each wire should be a different color; an example would be black for the "hot," red for the "grounded neutral," and white for the "neutral." Once you identify the colors of the wires, unscrew the terminal screws on the back of the dryer and fasten the power cord wires to the correct slots. Make sure the terminal screws are securely connected to ensure safety from possible electric shocks and to ensure effective electrical current. 

When you're done wiring, you should always check the terminal screws for any signs of wear or corrosion. If you properly installed your wiring, and no exposed wires or power cord wires are loose, you can turn the dryer on. With basic electrical wiring knowledge, you can easily and quickly ensure your dryer is working safely and efficiently. 

Having a dryer in your home has many benefits. It allows you to quickly dry your clothes so you can wear them and get on with your day. By understanding the basics of dryer wiring, you can ensure that your dryer is working safely and efficiently.
