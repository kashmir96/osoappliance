Summertime is here and the heat is on. As temperatures begin to soar, it’s time to think about air conditioning in your home. Air conditioning can help keep you and your family cool, improve comfort levels and maintain indoor air quality in the warmer months. However, it’s not just a matter of switching on an AC unit and turning up the temperature – there are certain best practices to help ensure effective operation of your system.

The first step in ensuring optimal performance from your air conditioning system is proper maintenance. This typically involves changing filters, cleaning coils and replacing refrigerant as needed by a qualified technician. Regular maintenance can reduce energy consumption by up to 15% which saves money over time. It also helps prevent indoor air pollution from dust or allergens that could be circulated throughout the home if filters are not regularly changed.

In addition to regular maintenance, there are other tips for improving efficiency and reducing energy costs associated with running an AC unit:

1) Install a programmable thermostat – By installing a programmable thermostat you can set times when temperatures will automatically be adjusted so that you don’t waste energy cooling an empty room while at work or on vacation. You can also adjust settings according to season or weather patterns so that you don’t have to manually turn up or down the temperature every day. 
2) Use fans – Fans can circulate air throughout the house, helping cool down individual rooms without using extra power from the AC unit itself– this can reduce energy consumption significantly over time. 
3) Close off unused rooms – Closing off rooms not being used will help conserve energy by focusing cooling only in areas where you need it most 
4) Seal gaps around windows & doors – Make sure all windows & doors are sealed properly as warm air entering through cracks around these openings will reduce cooling efficiency significantly 

Following these residential best practices for operating an AC unit during hot summer months will help ensure optimal performance while saving money on monthly utility bills in return!
