## Maximizing Scrap Value of an Air Conditioner
Over the years, air conditioners were once a luxury item, but now it’s an essential home comfort appliance for many people, and for that reason, we’ll want to get rid of our old AC unit and make some money from it as scrapping it for its parts. In this blog post, we’ll explore various tips and tricks to help maximize the scrap value of your air conditioner.

When scrapping your old air conditioner for its parts, pay attention to the details of the unit. Check the type of material used and its weight. Many parts are made of lighter materials such as aluminum and plastic, so if your model is relatively new, it’s likely to be made of these lightweight materials. The heavier the material, the more valuable it is since scrap yards often pays more for heavier materials. 

Disassembling an air conditioner can be difficult, so its best to get help from a professional appliance repair technician or someone who’s familiar with the process. This will ensure that you’ll reap the most benefit from your air conditioner by properly and safely removing all the usable parts. Before you start disassembling, be sure to document all your findings just in case there are replacement parts needed later when dealing with an appliance repair technician.

After your disassembling is completed, prepare the parts for transport to the scrapyard. It is as simple as sorting out the large parts from the small parts, taking apart any motors and compressors, removing copper wire and any useful metal parts. These steps can helpful in scraping your air conditioner for its parts.

It’s also important to shop around for the best price for the parts you intend to scrap, because some scrapyards may offer more money for certain parts than others. To find the most fair prices, research extensively and get quotes from various places before selling so that you get the most out of your money. 

To maximize the scrap value of your air conditioner, you need to consider the details of the unit, disassemble it with help, and prepare the parts for transport. Plus, make sure to research extensively and get quotes from various places to ensure you get the best value for the parts you scrap.
