## Troubleshooting an Error Code on Your Miele Dishwasher

Trying to fix an issue with an appliance can be a daunting task, especially if you don't know how to find the error code. Many dishwasher models have error codes that display on a screen if something goes wrong. This is helpful if you know how to interpret them, but if you don't it can be a confusing process. Let's take a look at how to find the error code on your Miele dishwasher and the best ways to interpret it.

The first thing you need to do is locate the error code. Some older Miele dishwashers will have a central display on the panel that shows any issues that have occurred. If your model is a little older, this information will likely be on this display. If you have a newer model, you may need to press a button on the control panel to display the error codes. Once you have located the error code, you should write it down for reference so you can look it up later.

Once you have the code, you can look it up in your user manual or online. If you don't have the manual, try searching Google or go to the Miele website to find a list of error codes. They will help you get a better understanding of what is causing the issue. You can also check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) which can help you troubleshoot and diagnose what is going on.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter if you have an older or newer model. Error codes should usually be displayed on the control panel of your Miele dishwasher. Once you have the exact code, you can determine the cause of the problem and the best way to fix it. With the right resources, you should have no problem interpreting the error code and getting your dishwasher running again.
