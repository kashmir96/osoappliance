## Resolving Philips Coffee Machine Error Code 2

Coffee machine error codes are frustrating when they appear, but they are put in place by the manufacturer to help diagnose and correct problems. If the error code 2 appears on your Philips Coffee Machine, then follow the steps below to quickly and easily solve the issue.

Error code 2 usually means that there is sufficient water in the machine; however, the water pressure is causing the brewer to be unable to draw the water. To resolve this: 

1. Check the water line that connects the machine to the sink. There may be a blockage in the line, so ensure the line is clean and unobstructed. 

2. Ensure that the water pressure in the system is set between 1.0 and 2.0 bars. Lowering or increasing the pressure may be necessary to achieve this. 

3. The machine may not be grounded properly. Check to see that the ground wires and power boards have proper grounding. 

4. If the error persists, then you may need to contact the manufacturer directly and consult with a technician. 

Hopefully this information helps you resolve the error code 2 on your Philips Coffee Machine. If you ever experience a household appliance issue and need help, be sure to consult our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for further assistance.
