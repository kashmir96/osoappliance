When it comes to laundry appliances, timing is everything. You don't want to buy a new washer or dryer when they're about to go on sale, but you also don't want to wait too long and end up with an outdated model. So when is the best time to buy laundry appliances?

The answer may surprise you: the best time to buy laundry appliances is actually in the fall. That's because most manufacturers release their new models in the spring, so by fall, there are usually some great deals to be had on last year's models. Of course, you can also find good deals on laundry appliances at other times of the year, but if you're looking for the best possible price, fall is the time to shop.

So there you have it: the best time to buy laundry appliances is in the fall. Happy shopping!
