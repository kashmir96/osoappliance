New Zealand is known for its abundance of natural resources and its commitment to sustainability. In recent years, the country has seen an increase in the number of locally made appliance brands founded in New Zealand. These brands are committed to creating quality products that are environmentally friendly and designed to last.

The most popular of these brands is Fisher & Paykel. Founded in 1934, the company has become a leader in the appliance industry, offering a wide range of products including refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, and more. Fisher & Paykel is committed to creating energy-efficient appliances that are designed to reduce waste and save money. They also have a wide range of products that are designed to make life easier, such as their Smart Drive washing machines that can be controlled from a smartphone.

Fisher & Paykel was created by two New Zealanders, Sir Woolf Fisher and Maurice Paykel in the area of Auckland. The company was founded on the principles of innovation, quality, and customer service. They were the first company to introduce a refrigerator with an automatic defrost system and the first to introduce a washing machine with a reversible motor.

The company has since become a global leader in the appliance industry and is now owned by the Haier Group.
