## Repairing Your LG Washing Machine for a Fast Fix 
Most of us depend on our washing machine to keep our houses in order. But when it comes to certain repairs, things can get complicated. Don’t panic if you are having trouble with your LG washing machine! These helpful tips and solutions can get you back up and running quickly.

Getting your LG washer fixed quickly is key. Before taking a look yourself, the most convenient step is to contact a qualified repair technician. Many parts can be difficult to locate and fix, and it’s best to get this taken care of by a professional.

If you do decide to tackle something yourself, always make sure to unplug the washer before taking a look inside. Wearing protective gear and keeping kids and pets away are always good ideas. Make sure to check the owners manual before you begin, as instructions can vary from model to model.

The most common issues that LG washers experience include: not spinning the clothes dry, the door not closing properly, or the washer not completing it’s cycle. We definitely don’t want to be walking around trying to carry our soaking wet clothing! 

In some cases, unlatching the washer door manually and resetting the bacteria-zapping ECO drum clean cycle can get things working again. Power supplying issues or defective parts can also cause your LG washer to fail to work. In this case, it is important to repair or replace these components before using the washer again.
