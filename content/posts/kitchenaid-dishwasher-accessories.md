If you’ve recently purchased a KitchenAid dishwasher, you may be wondering what accessories are available to make cleaning dishes easier. Well, you’ve come to the right place! From racks and cutlery baskets to detergents and more, there are plenty of KitchenAid dishwasher accessories available to help make the cleaning process faster and more efficient. 

Racks: Racks help keep your dishes organized in your dishwasher. There are several types of racks designed for different types of dishes, such as a stemware rack for your glasses or a silverware basket for utensils. You can also find adjustable racks that allow you to customize the layout of your dishwasher based on what type of items you’re washing. 

Cutlery Baskets: Cutlery baskets provide a secure way to store utensils during the wash cycle without fear of them falling out or getting damaged. The baskets are typically divided into sections so that smaller items like forks and spoons don’t get lost in the wash cycle. 

Detergents: KitchenAid offers its own line of detergents specifically designed for its dishwashers. These detergents ensure that your dishes come out sparkling clean every time by removing tough stains and food residue from all surfaces quickly and effectively. 

Spray Arms: Spray arms spray water onto all surfaces within the dishwasher cavity, ensuring that each item is thoroughly washed from top to bottom with maximum efficiency. KitchenAid has several spray arm designs available depending on how much coverage is needed for each load size. 

Steam Cleaning System: This system uses steam technology to sanitize dishes without harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing pads, making it perfect for those who want an eco-friendly way to clean their dishes without compromising on performance. The steam cleaning system also helps reduce water use while providing excellent results every time! 

These are just some of the many accessories available for KitchenAid dishwashers – there are plenty more out there if you take some time to look around! With these accessories, not only will your dishes get cleaned faster and with less effort but they'll also look better than ever before!
