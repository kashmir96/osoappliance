Your dryer not drying your clothes properly can be frustrating, especially when you’re in a rush. Fortunately, there are quick and easy fixes you can try to get it working again without having to call in an appliance repair technician. Let’s take a look at some common causes of dryers not drying correctly and how to troubleshoot them. 

1. Clogged Lint Filter 
The most common cause of a dryer not drying is a clogged lint filter. This is usually caused by failure to regularly clean the filter after each load of laundry is completed. If the filter is clogged, it won't allow enough air flow for the dryer to heat up and complete its cycle, resulting in wet clothes at the end of the cycle. Make sure to clean out your lint filter before every use and replace it if necessary for optimal performance. 

2. Vent Blockage 
Another potential cause for a dryer not being able to properly heat up could be due to blockage in the vent line that runs from your washer/dryer unit outside your home or apartment (if applicable). A blocked vent line will restrict airflow from outside and prevent heat from escaping during operation, resulting in wet clothes at the end of each cycle as well as potentially creating unsafe conditions such as carbon monoxide buildup inside your home or apartment building if left unresolved for too long! Make sure there are no debris obstructing this line before trying anything else—a vacuum cleaner with brush attachment should do the trick here! 

3. Thermostat Problems 
If neither of these issues seem like they might be causing your problem, you may want to check out whether or not something has gone wrong with one of the thermostats in your unit: either located inside on top (for gas models) or behind/underneath (for electric models). To test this—unplugged first—set multimeter probes on each terminal while checking resistance readings; they should match up with those listed on unit's manual; if they don't match then thermostat needs replacing! If everything looks normal though then move onto next step…

4. Heating Element Issues 
If all else fails then it could be time for more serious troubleshooting: checking out whether something has gone wrong with heater element itself! To do this unplug unit once again and carefully remove back panel - taking note which wires were connected where - before removing heating element screws so that you can inspect coil itself; any signs corrosion? It needs replacing if so! Otherwise replace fasteners & put back panel – making sure no electrical components are exposed – & run full testing cycle; hopefully problem solved now…
