When it comes to buying a washing machine, it’s often best to go big or go home. But with prices running into the thousands of dollars, you need to make sure that you’re investing in the right product. That’s why we’ve put together this list of the most expensive washing machines for 2020. 

At the top of the list is Samsung’s WF45R6100AC Front Load Washer with AddWash Door. This model features a 5.2 cubic foot capacity and an internally lit stainless steel drum for more efficient cleaning performance. It also has an advanced vibration control system that reduces noise and vibration levels during operation, allowing you to wash clothes peacefully in your own home without having to worry about disturbing anyone else in your house. The AddWash door feature allows you to conveniently add items into your load mid-cycle, so you won't have to start all over again if you forget something. It also offers smart connectivity via Wi-Fi or Samsung Smart Home app so that you can monitor and control cycles remotely from anywhere using your smartphone or tablet device. The price tag? A whopping $1,799 USD!

Next up is LG's WM9500HKA TwinWash washer dryer combo unit with TurboSteam technology and Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and control via SmartThinQ app. This model is designed for larger households as it offers a 5.2 cubic foot ultra large capacity drum plus a second 1 cubic foot mini washer on top to handle smaller loads separately from larger ones while saving time, money and space in one convenient package! The advanced TurboSteam technology eliminates stubborn stains without pre-treating while LG's TrueBalance anti-vibration system reduces noise levels during operation making it ideal for noise sensitive environments like bedrooms or living rooms. And if that wasn't enough, this model also offers 14 different washing cycles plus multiple temperature settings so that you can customize each cycle depending on what type of laundry needs washing! This particular unit carries an MSRP of $2,999 USD! 

Finally, there's Miele's TWI180WP 24" Ventless Heat Pump Tumble Dryer which offers perfect drying performance thanks to its advanced heat pump technology which works by recycling hot air from inside the drum back into the drying cycle instead of venting heat outdoors thus saving energy and money on bills over time! It also features a 10 programs with 10 different temperature settings as well as wrinkle free options for those times when life gets too busy and clothes pile up faster than they can be washed! And if all that wasn't enough already, this model even has built in sensors which detect moisture levels inside the drum ensuring perfect results every time regardless of load size! Unfortunately all these features come at a price though - $3299 USD is what Miele are asking for their latest tumble dryer offering! 

 All three models featured on our list offer excellent value when compared against other similarly priced units but they do come at quite hefty price tags so make sure to do some research before taking the plunge - after all no one wants buyers remorse down the line when they find out they could have got better value elsewhere!
