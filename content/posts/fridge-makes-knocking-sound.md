Does your fridge make a knocking noise every now and then? If so, you may be wondering what is causing this strange sound and whether or not it needs to be addressed immediately.

Noises coming from your fridge can be caused by a variety of things, ranging from normal wear and tear to more serious issues. Knocking noises are typically the result of something vibrating against another surface or object inside the unit, such as the fan blades hitting against something else in the appliance. It is also possible that a piece of food or other item has become lodged in between two components inside the refrigerator, causing it to vibrate as it moves around. 

Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take yourself in order to fix this problem before having to resort to calling out a professional repair service. The first step is to identify where exactly the noise is coming from by listening closely and locating its source within the unit. Once you have identified this area, check for any foreign objects that could potentially be causing vibrations when moved around; these may include loose change or similar items that have fallen into hard-to-reach areas. If so, remove these items carefully and make sure they don't fall back down into your appliance again!

If there are no visible foreign objects present inside your fridge that could be making a knocking noise, then you may need to investigate further into what components are actually causing this issue. Start with inspecting all fan blades for any build-up of dirt or dust which could prevent them from spinning freely; clear any blockages if necessary using an appropriate cleaning tool (such as compressed air). You should also check if any components within your refrigerator's compressor unit have come loose due to age or wear and tear; tighten up any screws/nuts if applicable in order to ensure everything is properly secured again. 

Finally, ensure that all rubber seals around doors/drawers etc., are still intact as these will help reduce vibration levels significantly when opened/closed correctly - replace them if necessary! Following these steps should help reduce those annoying knocks emanating from your fridge - but if all else fails then don't hesitate to contact an experienced repair serviceman for assistance!
