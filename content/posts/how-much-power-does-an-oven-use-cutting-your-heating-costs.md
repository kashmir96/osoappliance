## Ovens Use Power - Cutting Your Heating Costs 

Are you looking to reduce your heating costs? If so, one appliance you may want to look into is your oven. Ovens require electricity, natural gas, and propane to turn on and off. Depending on the type of oven you have, the amount of energy it requires can vary. 

One simple way to determine how much power your oven uses is to look at the wattage. Most modern ovens consume around 2,500 to 2,900 watts. This means they can draw around 20 to 25 amps of electricity when in use. A tankless electric water heater, on the other hand, draws around 12 amps of power. You can calculate the approximate energy usage for your oven by multiplying the watts by the hours of operation. 

One way to reduce the amount of energy your oven requires is to only use it when necessary. Try to limit your oven usage to one hour per day if possible. This can significantly reduce your energy usage and lower your heating costs. 

You can also look into upgrading your oven. Many modern ovens come with special energy-saving features like convection bake and steam roasting. Convection bake uses hot air and fans to circulate the heat in your oven, leading to quicker and more efficient cooking. Steam roasting relies on the moisture in the food to generate its heat. This can reduce your oven’s energy usage by up to 30%. 

If you’re in the market for a new oven, investigate options with the latest energy-saving technology. Smart ovens, in particular, are great because they can monitor cooking and automatically adjust the temperature to ensure food is cooked evenly. Some ovens even have Wi-Fi capabilities, which can be used to monitor and control your oven’s temperature without ever having to open the door.
