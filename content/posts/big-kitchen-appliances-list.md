When it comes to outfitting your kitchen, big kitchen appliances are essential. From fridges and freezers to dishwashers and ovens, these large kitchen appliances can quickly become the cornerstone of your cooking routine.

If you’re in the market for a new set of large kitchen appliances, here’s a list of what you should consider adding to your home: 

1. Refrigerator/Freezer: A refrigerator is an essential part of any modern-day kitchen. Refrigerators keep food fresh and allow you to store leftovers for later use. You should also consider getting a separate freezer if you have lots of frozen items that need storing away. 

2. Dishwasher: Not only is a dishwasher incredibly convenient, but it also saves time and energy when it comes to cleaning up after meals. Most models come with adjustable racks that let you pack in as many dishes as possible before running the cycle - perfect for busy households! 

3. Oven/Range: An oven or range is necessary for baking or roasting anything from chicken nuggets to chocolate chip cookies! Some models come with extras like convection settings, self-cleaning options, and more - so be sure to research all the features available before making your purchase decision. 

4. Microwave: Microwaves can quickly heat up leftovers or defrost frozen foods without having to use an oven or stovetop - which makes them great additions for smaller kitchens where space is at a premium! Just be sure not to overuse them if you want your food heated evenly throughout! 

5. Coffee Maker/Coffee Grinder: If coffee is part of your daily routine, then investing in either a coffee maker (for quick caffeine fixes) or a coffee grinder (for freshly ground beans) can make mornings much easier! Plus they look great on countertops too!

6 Washer & Dryer : Laundry doesn't have to be such an arduous task when you have washers and dryers on hand - especially since most models come with added features like multiple wash cycles and steam settings that help get clothes extra clean in no time at all!
