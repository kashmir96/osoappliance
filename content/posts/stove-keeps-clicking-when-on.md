If your stove keeps clicking when it’s on, it could be caused by a few different things. The most likely culprit is an issue with the igniter, which is the component responsible for lighting the gas in your stovetop. Here’s what you need to know about why your stove keeps clicking and how to fix it.

The most common cause of a stove clicking when on is an issue with the igniter. The igniter is a small electrical component that produces a spark to ignite the gas in your stovetop. If the igniter is worn out or damaged, it may not be able to produce enough spark to light the gas, causing it to click repeatedly as it tries.

In some cases, the issue may be caused by a buildup of debris or dirt inside the burner ports. This can prevent the gas from flowing properly, resulting in frequent clicking sounds as the igniter tries to light the gas. To fix this issue, you’ll need to clean out any debris or dirt that has built up inside the burner ports.

If neither of these issues are causing your stove to click, then you may need to replace your igniter altogether. To do this, you’ll need to turn off all power sources to your stove and disconnect any wiring connected to the igniter before removing it from its housing. Once removed, you can purchase a new igniter from most hardware stores and install it yourself following any included instructions.

No matter what’s causing your stove to click when on, it’s important that you address the issue quickly before any further damage can occur. If you’re unsure of how to diagnose or repair your stovetop yourself, contact a professional technician for assistance in getting your appliance back up and running safely again.
