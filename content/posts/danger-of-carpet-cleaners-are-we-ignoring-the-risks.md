## Are We Ignoring the Risks of Carpet Cleaners?
It's easy to ignore potential risks that come along with household appliances such as carpet cleaners, but this can put our safety in danger. As carpets age, they tend to require more regular cleaning, but with the wrong products, this cleaning can sometimes cause more damage than good. Here, we'll explore the dangers of carpet cleaners, and whether we're paying enough attention to these risks. 

Carpet cleaners often use harsh chemicals to disinfect carpets and remove stains. Many of these products contain bleach, ammonia, and other caustic substances that, if mishandled, can have serious consequences. Certain additives may also release toxic fumes in our homes, endangering the health of both humans and pets living in the space, and sometimes making it difficult to breathe. 

These products also raise the risk of skin irritation and other health issues. If these substances come into contact with our skin, they can cause irritation or burning, and in extreme cases, long-term damage or illness. Without the right protective clothing or safety equipment, this risk can be very real. 

At the same time, it's important to understand that, properly used, many carpet cleaners are perfectly safe. We can take certain precautions to avoid the danger, such as investing in safety equipment, wearing gloves and long sleeves while working with the product, and paying special attention to the handling instruction of the product. 

It's also important to pay attention to the signs of damage in your carpets, and to rely on certified professionals when needed. Any time a carpet shows signs of persistent staining, or if you require an intensive clean to prepare for a sale or move-out, it's best to outsource the job to qualified and experienced technicians who have the tools and the expertise to perform a safe, effective cleaning job. 

We all have a responsibility to ensure the safety of ourselves and our families. It's important to develop an understanding of the potential risks of carpet cleaners, and to take special care to handle them properly and remain vigilant when they're in use.
