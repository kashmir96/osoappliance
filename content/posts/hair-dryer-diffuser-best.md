A hair dryer diffuser is a great tool for creating volume and curl in your hair. But knowing how to use a diffuser properly can be tricky. Here are some best practices to help you get the most out of your diffuser.

1. Start with clean, damp hair. Before using a diffuser, make sure your hair is clean and damp—not soaking wet. Towel-dry your hair until it’s about 80% dry, then apply a styling product such as mousse or gel to give your hair more texture and hold.

2. Use the right nozzle for your length and texture of hair. A diffuser should be used with the correct nozzle for your particular length and texture of hair. A larger nozzle is better for long or thick hair, while a smaller nozzle works better for short or fine hair.

3. Take your time when drying with a diffuser. When using a diffuser, take your time and don’t rush the process—this will help you create more even curls and volume in your hair. Start by placing the diffuser at the roots of each section of hair, then slowly move it down towards the ends while gently twirling sections of hair around the nozzle as you go along.

4. Avoid over-drying or heat damage. When using a diffuser, make sure to keep the heat setting on low or medium so that you don’t over-dry or damage your hair with too much heat exposure. Also, be sure to keep the nozzle moving so that it doesn’t stay in one spot for too long—this will help avoid any hot spots that could cause damage to your strands. 

5. Finish with hairspray or styling cream if desired . Once you’re done drying with a diffuser, you can finish off with some hairspray or styling cream if desired to help keep your curls in place all day long! 


By following these tips and best practices for using a diffuser, you can achieve beautiful curls and volume in no time!

Examples of great hair dryer diffusers are the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer, the Remington Pro Hair Dryer Diffuser, and the BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Hair Dryer.
