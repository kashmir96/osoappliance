## An Oven Eating Up Big Bucks

 Buying appliances for the home often comes with a hefty price tag. Investing in the biggest, most expensive stove or oven one can find is a common, yet costly decision that can lead to long-term debt, or worse, financial disaster. 

The allure of cramming one's kitchen with the most impressive appliances on the market is strong. However, the short-term benefit of having the fanciest model often times backfires when the high price tags start to eat into a household's budget. One of the biggest mistakes someone can make is to buy the biggest, best model in a series of options -- only to regret that purchase later on down the line. 

It could be better to shop around and invest in a smaller oven with less features that works just as well. Not only will it cost less upfront, but also will free up extra cash and bring some peace of mind in regards to money management. Shopping for used appliances can also be just as reliable, and sometimes even come with extended warranties or additional discounts. 

Before plunking down any money for an appliance, especially a large one like an oven, take the time to shop around and look for the best deals and incentives. Compare brands, models and prices so as to find the best product for the least amount of money. This will help avoid any delicious but dreadful mistakes in terms of appliance investment.
