When the temperatures start to rise, having a portable air conditioner can be a lifesaver. Not only do they help keep your home or office cool and comfortable, but they’re also convenient and easy to move from one place to another. In New Zealand, there are a number of great options when it comes to portable air conditioners, so you’ll have no problem finding one that fits your needs and budget.

One of the most important things to consider when shopping for a portable air conditioner is size. You need to make sure that you buy a unit that has enough power to cool the room you intend on using it in. Most models are rated in British Thermal Units (BTUs), which measure the amount of cooling power provided by an air conditioner. The larger the BTU rating, the more powerful your unit will be. In general, go with a model with at least 8000 BTUs if you plan on using it in one room up to 20 square metres in size or 12000 BTUs if you plan on using it in two rooms up to 30 square metres each in size.

Noise level is another key factor when shopping for an air conditioning unit as no one wants unbearable loud noises coming from their AC unit! Most models come with an energy efficiency rating (EER) which measures how efficiently the device operates when running at full capacity - higher EER ratings usually mean quieter operation so look out for this when comparing different units. Additionally, some units may also list decibels so be sure to check this too as anything over 70 dB can start getting quite noisy!

Another thing you should pay attention to is energy efficiency ratings as these are indicative of how much electricity your AC will use while running - higher ratings mean lower electricity bills as your device won't draw as much power while running! Additionally, some models may also come with additional features such as timer settings or remote controls which can make operation even easier and more convenient - be sure to check out all available options before making your final decision! 

Finally, take note of any warranties provided by manufacturers and read through them carefully - some companies may offer extended coverage against defects while others might only provide limited protection against certain issues so make sure you know what kind of warranty you're getting before buying any particular model! 

 All these tips should help ensure that you find the perfect portable airconditioner for your needs and budget so get searching today - stay cool and enjoy those hot summer days!
