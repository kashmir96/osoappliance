If your dishwasher isn't getting hot, it may be due to a few possible issues. First, make sure the dishwasher is connected to a hot water supply. If it is, then the issue may be due to a faulty heating element. The heating element is responsible for heating the water in the dishwasher to the desired temperature. If it is not working properly, the water may not be hot enough to properly clean the dishes. 

Another potential issue is a clogged filter. The filter is responsible for catching food particles that are washed off the dishes. If the filter is clogged, it can prevent the dishwasher from properly draining, which can lead to a lack of hot water.

Finally, the issue may be due to a faulty thermostat. The thermostat is responsible for regulating the temperature of the water in the dishwasher. If it is not working properly, it may not be able to accurately detect the temperature of the water, resulting in a lack of hot water.

If your dishwasher isn't getting hot, it is important to identify and address the issue as soon as possible. If left unchecked, it can lead to a buildup of bacteria and other contaminants, which can be harmful to your health. If you need assistance diagnosing and repairing the issue, it is best to contact a professional.
