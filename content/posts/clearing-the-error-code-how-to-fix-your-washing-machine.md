## Clearing a Washing Machine Error Code

What could derail your laundry day more than a mysterious error code on your washing machine? Reading and interpreting the code correctly is half the battle, but clearing that error code and getting your washer back up and running is the ultimate goal. Here’s a short guide on how to properly clear an error code and get your washing machine working again. 

First, it’s important to make sure that the appliance is unplugged or disconnected from its power source. Once it is safe, you can access any known error code on your washer Via the Diagnostic Mode. Check with your washing machine’s user manual for step-by-step instructions to access your diagnostic mode; the instructions will differ by model and make. 

Once in the diagnostic mode, advanced users may be able to interpret and identify the error code; however, it is highly suggested to compare the code to a reliable source. After identifying the code it is important to identify and resolve the underlying issue with the washer before it can be cleared and the appliance reset. 

Depending on the make and model of the washer, resetting the appliance can be done in a few different ways. Checking the user manual might be the best way to identify which reset mode is available on the appliance. Some washing machines might require the reset to be done manually, while other may require a vacuum level reset, or a master reset of the machine. 

Once the underlying issue has been resolved, the error code should be cleared, and the washing machine should be running as expected. It is also a good rule of thumb to check your user manual regularly and follow its series of care and maintenance instructions to ensure a longer and better performance of the appliance. 

Clearing an error code can sound daunting, but with the right amount of research and patience, it is a manageable task.
