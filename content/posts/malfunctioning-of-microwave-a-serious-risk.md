## A Risk to Consider with Malfunctioning Microwaves 

We take our everyday household appliances for grantedâ€¦until they malfunction! Of all of our essential household appliances, the microwave carries a multitude of potential risks if it is not working correctly. It is important to understand the risks posed by a malfunctioning microwave, and what you can do about it.

One of the primary risks posed by a malfunctioning microwave is electrocution. If the insulation, electrical components, or wiring of the microwave is damaged, it is possible for the user to receive an electric shock when using the device. In severe cases, this electric shock can even lead to a user being electrocuted. This risk is particularly dangerous because, much like any other wiring issue, it is difficult for the user to inspect and find faults in the internal components of an appliance. 

A malfunctioning microwave can also lead to an electrical fire. Due to the heat given off when the microwave is used, components like the switch, capacitor, relay, or transformer may be destroyed or malfunction. However, even if these parts are functioning properly, it is also possible for inadequate ventilation, or blockages in the venting, to lead to an electrical fire hazard.

Reducing the risk posed by a malfunctioning microwave is a balance between both prevention and proper maintenance. As a first step, you should always keep your microwave clean. This helps to ensure that proper ventilation is maintained, and that dust and dirt does not accumulate on electrical contacts or wires. Additionally, it is important to heed warnings and recall notices about your microwave, ensuring that you are using the latest and most up-to-date version.

Finally, no matter how much preventive maintenance you do, you still need to be alert for any warning signs that your microwave may be malfunctioning. Check for any burned or discolored spots indicating electrical arcs or other dangerous problems. Make sure that the door seals properly and does not have any gaps. Have it checked out for any further faults that you can't spot. 

Malfunctioning microwaves lurk as a hidden danger in our homes and can cause serious harm. It is therefore important to do the appropriate maintenance and keep an eye out for any warning signs that your microwave may be malfunctioning. If you suspect that there may be an issue, take a look at our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for what to look out for and how to rectify it.
