## Identifying and Addressing Common GE Microwave Errors
Have you ever encountered the frustration of your GE microwave displaying a mysterious error code? Many modern appliances come with error codes that, while useful, can be difficult to decipher. Fortunately, learning how to identify and troubleshoot GE microwave error codes is straightforward, and can often be done with basic tools. 

The most common error codes from GE microwave ovens fall into one of two categories: 1) F code errors and 2) SE code errors. F codes indicate errors that refer to the microwave oven’s functions and features, such as touchpad keys, scouring features, sound settings, and more. SE codes refer to errors caused by short circuits, high voltage tripping, or some form of malfunction. 

Furthermore, many GE microwaves have an Error Registry that stores details of the 10 most recent errors. If the error doesn’t update in the registry, it may be indicating a problem with the event logging, or a problem with the touchpad keys. 

F codes tend to be easier to identify as they typically begin with an “F” (e.g. F1, F2, F3). To troubleshoot F codes, press the Reminder/End key and hold it down until the error is cleared. If this fails, you may need to reset the microwave oven. To reset a GE microwave oven, press and hold the “Start” and “1” buttons for about 10 seconds. If the code persists, refer to the owner’s manual for further instructions. 

SE codes refer to faults with mechanical or electronic components such as short circuits, HV tripping, and more. To troubleshoot SE codes, press the Reminder/End key and hold it down until the code is cleared. If the code persists and you are able to locate it in the error registry, contact a qualified GE appliance technician for further service. 

Troubleshooting GE microwave error codes can be stressful and can take some time, but with the help of a GE owner’s manual and basic tools, you should be able to identify, diagnose, and fix any errors you encounter. Using modern, advanced kitchen appliances like GE microwaves can make your life easier, but when they malfunction, having the skills and knowledge to troubleshoot error codes can be invaluable.
