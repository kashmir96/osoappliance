## Make Cleaning Your Oven Easier with Self-Cleaning Functionality
Keeping your oven clean is a chore that many are eager to avoid, but the good news is that the task of cleaning an oven can be made much easier with self-cleaning functionality. This feature will help you save time and energy by reducing the level of hand scrubbing that it takes to get your oven clean.

When it comes to using the self-cleaning cycle on your oven, the first step is to empty out all of the shelves and racks inside the oven. Every oven is different, so check your owner’s manual for any additional steps to take before beginning the cycle. After that, you can press the “self-cleaning” button on the oven and then choose the appropriate cleaning cycle that’s best suited for your oven.

You should make sure that you are aware of how long it takes to complete the cleaning cycle, as ovens usually take two to four hours. But it's important to remember to avoid using your oven while the self-cleaning cycle is in progress. During the cycle, the high temperatures can cause damage to any food that might be left in the oven.

Once the cycle has been completed, the oven will cool down to a temperature that’s safe to touch. It should be easy to remove the ash and debris from the oven at this point. However, it's also important to mention that there is usually an odor during the cycle, so make sure that your kitchen is ventilated and that you don't keep yourself in an enclosed space during the self-cleaning cycle.

Using self-cleaning functionality on your oven is a great way to make the cleaning process easier, but like with any appliance you should check your owner’s manual for instructions and cleaning guidelines. If you ever experience any issues while using the self-cleaning cycle, make sure to contact an [appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). They will be able to help you solve any problems that could be preventing your oven from self-cleaning properly. 

With the self-cleaning cycle, cleaning your oven has never been easier. And if you ever run into any issues or need a professional to take a look at your oven, our appliance repair technicians are here to help.
