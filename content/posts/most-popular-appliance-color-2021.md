As the kitchen is often a focal point in the home, appliance colors can have a big impact on the overall aesthetic. Since 2021 is all about modern, minimalistic design, there are a few key appliance colors that are most popular right now. 

One of the most common colors for appliances this year is stainless steel. Stainless steel has been popular for over a decade, and its popularity only continues to grow in 2021. This classic look works well with any color palette and it gives off an air of sophistication and timelessness. 

Another great option is black stainless steel. Black stainless provides an interesting contrast to lighter-colored cabinets and countertops, making it ideal for contemporary kitchens. Plus, black stainless steel doesn’t show fingerprints as easily as traditional stainless steel does and it helps create a more uniform look in your kitchen. 

White appliances are also still going strong in 2021—especially for those who prefer neutral tones like white or gray cabinets and countertops. White appliances can give any kitchen an open and airy feel while still adding character to your space. They also blend nicely with other sleek metal accents like chrome faucets or brushed nickel handles on drawers and cabinet doors. 

Finally, matte finishes are becoming increasingly popular this year as homeowners search for more unique looks to make their kitchens stand out from the crowd. From glossy black to muted grays to navy blue hues—matte finishes offer subtle sophistication that can easily be mixed with other materials like wood or stone accents in your kitchen design. 

By choosing one of these trendy appliance colors, you’ll be sure to make your kitchen stand out while still keeping up with the latest trends!
