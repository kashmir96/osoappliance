## Error Code E42: Troubleshooting Tips
Malfunctioning and error codes are some of the most frustrating parts of owning and operating appliances. Sometimes, our devices give us an indication of what the issue may be with an error code, like E42. Understanding these codes and how to troubleshoot the problems they represent can help you get the best performance out of your household appliances.

Error code E42 usually indicates that there is an issue with the communication between the main board and motor control board. The first thing you should do when you encounter this error code is unplug the appliance. If it is not possible to unplug the device, then turn off the circuit breaker connected to it. When that is done, you should disconnect the motor and check the cabling connected to the board. Once that has been checked, then you should try to plug the appliance back in, or reset the circuit breaker to see if the issue is resolved. 

It is possible that the cable is the issue, in which case you may need to replace the cable. The error code itself can also be the result of a faulty motor, so if the code persists then you might need to replace the motor. If the fault code still remains, then the issue may be with the main or motor control board, and you may need to replace it depending on the severity. 

Error code E42 can be a warning that your appliance is having a problem and indicate the root of the problem. Knowing what troubleshooting steps to take can save time and money in getting the appliance back in proper working order. If you determine the issue to be too technical or the repairs too advanced, then a qualified technician may be the best option.
