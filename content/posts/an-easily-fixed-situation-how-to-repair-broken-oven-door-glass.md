## Repair Your Broken Oven Door Glass Easily 

If your oven door glass has broken, you do not need to accept this as a part of life! Fixing the broken glass in your oven door is an easily fixable situation, and you can get it done in no time. With the right instructions and the correct tools utilised, your broken glass can be repaired in no time and you can continue to use your oven with ease.

To repair your broken oven door glass, begin by shutting off the power of the appliance and removing the screws from the inside of the oven door. Be sure to place the screws in a sealed container or a bag to avoid getting them lost. Next, remove any other fasteners such as clips or hinges, and separate the glass from the door. Disconnect the wires from the clips and unscrew them from the door frame. 

Once the door is freed from the frame, take a close look at the broken glass pieces. By assessing the extent of the damage, you can decide if the broken pieces must be replaced, or simply put back together. If the broken pieces are beyond repair, you can go to a store to buy new glass pieces to replace them, and make sure the measurements match the original pieces. 

When you have the new and/or broken pieces, carefully clean them and remove any dust particles or residue. Make sure the pieces fit securely and closely when you place them together. Use a proper sealant around the edges of the glass to create a strong and lasting bond. 

Once the sealant has dried, you can begin to reassemble the oven door. Connect the wires to their clips and reattach the hinges and other fasteners. Screw the door securely to the frame and place the oven door in its previous position. 

Your oven door should now be securely sealed and ready to be used. If you are unsure of any steps during the repair process, it is best to enlist the help of a professional for quick, safe and secure results.
