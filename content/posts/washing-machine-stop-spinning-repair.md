# Washing machine stop spinning repair Christchurch

If you're from Christchurch, you know our weather can be hit or miss–and as such we need to have a variety of clothes at the ready to brave the elements and enjoy the garden city. This really gives our washing machines a workout, and often can wear them out to the point they stop spinning.

If your washing machine is not spinning, it can be a frustrating experience. Not only does it mean that your clothes won’t get clean, but it can also mean that you’re stuck with a pile of wet laundry. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to troubleshoot and repair your washing machine.

The first thing you should do is check the power supply. Make sure that the power cord is securely plugged into the wall and that the outlet is working. If the power is on, then you should move on to the next step.

Next, you should check the lid switch or door lock. This is a safety device that prevents the washing machine from spinning when the lid or door is open. Make sure that the lid/door is securely closed and that the switch is in the correct position (or door lock is clicking effectively). If it's not, you may need to replace it.

If the power is on and the lid switch is in the correct position, then you should check the drive belt. This is the belt that connects the motor to the drum. If it is loose or broken, then it needs to be replaced.

Finally, you should check the motor. If the motor is not working, then you may need to replace the brushes or clear a pump. If the motor is working, then you should check the timer. This is the device that controls the washing machine’s cycle. If the timer is not working, then you may need to replace it.

If none of these steps solve the problem, then you may need to call a professional for help, there's a range of good appliance repair experts in Christchurch. They can inspect the machine and determine what is causing the issue.

No matter what the cause of the problem is, it’s important to address it as soon as possible. A malfunctioning washing machine can cause a lot of frustration and wasted time. By taking the time to troubleshoot and repair the issue, you can get your washing machine up and running again in no time.
