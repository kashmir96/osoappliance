Fridge Making Loud Noise? Here Are a Few Ways to Fix It Yourself

If your fridge is making a loud noise, it's no doubt causing you some stress. Not only can it be annoying, but it can also be a sign of an impending repair or replacement. Before you pick up the phone and call an expensive repair service, here are a few ways to troubleshoot and fix the problem yourself.

1. Check the Condenser Coils: The condenser coils are located on the back of your refrigerator and typically look like black tubing or fins. If they become clogged with dust and debris, they may need to be cleaned off in order for the fridge to run more efficiently (and more quietly). Use a vacuum cleaner with an attached brush attachment to gently clean away any buildup that may have accumulated on these coils – taking care not to damage them in the process. 

2. Inspect Your Fridge Door: Over time, worn out door seals or gaskets can cause air leaks which can lead to noises coming from inside your refrigerator as well as possible energy loss due to warm air seeping in from outside sources. Inspect both sides of the door seals for signs of cracking or damage - if so then it’s time for a replacement seal/gasket set. 

3. Check Refrigerant Lines: If you find that all other areas appear fine but there’s still loud noises coming from inside your fridge, then this could indicate a fault with one of its refrigerant lines – usually either at its compressor or evaporator motor unit located at its bottom back side panel (or underneath if there is no panel). To ensure that these components aren't blocked or damaged in any way - causing refrigerant pressure imbalance - locate them and use compressed air (or low-pressure water) with caution for cleaning purposes only; using caution not to bend/damage them in anyway during process/inspection period... 

4) Clean Compressor Fan & Motor Unit: Finally check if fan blades are obstructed by dirt & debris build up; clear out any obstruction (or replace fan blades altogether) with utmost care being taken not make contact between metal parts while doing so.. Also inspect compressor motor unit's bearings & oil level – if required add special type oil used only for such compression motors type repairs... 

Hopefully one of these DIY solutions has helped solve your problem! But if none have worked then there’s likely something more serious going on where professional help may be needed – either way you should now feel more prepared before picking up that phone... Good luck!
