A kettle's minimum fill line is an important safety feature that helps to ensure safe and efficient operation. The minimum fill line is designed to indicate the lowest amount of water that should be used when filling the kettle, for a number of reasons.

First, filling a kettle with too little water can cause it to overheat and potentially cause damage or even start a fire. Overheating can happen when the heating element is exposed to air instead of being immersed in water. The minimum fill line acts as a guide to help users avoid this dangerous situation by ensuring that enough water is added in order to cover the element.

Second, using too little water can also reduce the efficiency of a kettle, causing it to take longer than necessary to reach boiling point. This not only wastes energy but also increases wear on the heating element, potentially shortening its lifespan. The minimum fill line ensures that users add enough water for optimal efficiency, helping them save time and money in the long run. 

Finally, having a minimum fill level set by manufacturers allows them to accurately calculate how much energy each model uses under typical conditions when testing for energy efficiency ratings such as those required by law in some countries or regions (e.g., Energy Star). 
 
In summary, kettles have a minimum fill line for safety reasons as well as efficiency and performance benefits â€“ so make sure you always add at least this much water before turning on your kettle!
