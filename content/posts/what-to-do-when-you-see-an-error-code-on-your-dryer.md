## Dealing with a Dryer Error Code

If your dryer starts throwing a pesky error code, it can be frustrating. However, there is no need to panic as it is typically easy to diagnose and fix the problem. Here are the steps that you should take. 

### Step 1: Troubleshoot

The first step is to look up the error code or message and troubleshoot potential causes and solutions. While each model and make is different, many codes are interconnected between brands and models. This will help you narrow down the cause of the problem and the solution.

### Step 2: Check the Power Supply

If you are able to determine the cause of the error code, it is always best to start by checking the power supply. The dryer’s motor, heating element and timer all require power. Make sure that all connections are securely attached and that the dryer is plugged into an active electrical outlet. 

### Step 3: Call a Repair Technician 

If you cannot determine the cause or cannot pinpoint a solution, it may be time to call in the experts. The inconvenience of a non-working dryer can be tough to deal with, that’s why having a reliable appliance repair technician can make the process much simpler. 

### Conclusion 

Be sure to address any issues with code or error messages on your dryer as soon as possible to prevent further damage and inconvenience. If troubleshooting does not fix the problem, it is best to contact a professional appliance repair technician.
