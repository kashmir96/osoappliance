## Avoid Expensive Repair Costs – Discover If Your Microwave Thermal Fuse is Blown
Microwave thermal fuses are designed to provide overload protection should there be a short circuit or some other electrical overload situation that could potentially cause harm if not properly resolved. If your microwave has stopped working or is operating in an erratic manner, you might want to check if the thermal fuse has been blown. Diagnosing the issue and changing out the fuse can be an inexpensive repair solution. 

A thermal fuse is an important component found in many of today’s appliances, including microwaves. In the event that too much power passes through or a surge is detected the fuse will trip, protecting the appliance from catching fire or becoming permanently damaged. 

To determine whether the thermal fuse is the issue, first unplug the microwave from the wall. Next, remove the outer cover of the microwave and locate the thermal fuse. It will usually be located near the fan mounting, usually at the top back of the microwave. Once you have located it, use a multimeter to test continuity. If there is continuity, the fuse is not the problem and you should look for another cause. 

If the fuse has blown, it will need to be replaced immediately. Most models will have a replacement thermal fuse available that can be purchased at a local home improvement or electronics store. Carefully remove the old fuse and replace it with the new one, ensuring that it is securely mounted. 

After replacing the thermal fuse, your microwave should once again be operational. If you experience any issue installing the new fuse or if the appliance does not work after the new fuse has been installed, seek help from a qualified repair technician.

Keeping your appliances in working order is important for safety and longevity. Paying attention to issues such as thermal fuses can help you to avoid expensive repair costs and keep your appliances in good condition.
