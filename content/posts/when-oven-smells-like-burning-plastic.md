If your oven smells like burning plastic, it is most likely due to a plastic item being left in the oven and melting. This can happen if you forget to remove a plastic container or bag that was used for food storage before using the oven. It can also occur if you leave a plastic utensil or other cooking tool in the oven while it is heating up.

When this happens, it’s important to take action right away. First, turn off the oven and open any windows in the kitchen to air out the area. Then, carefully remove the melted plastic from the oven with a pair of tongs or a spatula. Be sure to wear protective gloves and safety glasses when handling hot materials.

If any of the melted plastic has stuck to surfaces inside your oven, you may be able to clean it off with some elbow grease and an abrasive cleaner such as baking soda or Bon Ami powder. If that doesn’t work, you might need to call an appliance repair technician for help cleaning up any stubborn residue.

Burning plastic isn’t just unpleasant; it can be dangerous as well since toxic fumes may be released when something melts down inside an enclosed space like an oven cavity. To prevent this from happening again in the future, double check that all containers, utensils and other items are removed from your oven before turning it on or preheating it for baking or roasting purposes.
