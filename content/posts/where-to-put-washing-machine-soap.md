If you’re wondering where to put washing machine soap, the answer is simple: directly into the washing machine drum. Most modern washers don’t require you to use a separate detergent drawer or add the soap by hand. Instead, you can simply pour your detergent directly into the drum.

To do so, first measure out your desired amount of detergent and pour it directly into the drum of your washing machine. It is important to note that different types of detergents require different amounts of water for optimal cleaning power, so be sure to read and follow the directions on your specific brand for best results. Next, close the door or lid and select your desired wash cycle. Your washer will then automatically dispense the detergent during its wash cycle, ensuring that it gets properly distributed throughout your laundry load.

For front-loading machines in particular, make sure that you pour any powder detergents in first before adding any clothes or fabric softeners as this will help avoid residue build-up inside the washing machine over time. Additionally, if you are using liquid fabric softener rather than a dryer sheet in combination with liquid laundry soap, it's best to add both liquids together at once directly into the drum before starting a cycle so they mix properly with each other and don’t leave any residue behind on clothes after washing. 

When using laundry pods or capsules in a top-loading washer, it is important not to put them directly in with clothes as this can cause staining or spotting due to their concentrated nature; instead place them at least 4 inches away from any clothing items and make sure they are completely submerged under water before starting a cycle for proper cleaning power. 

Overall, when it comes to knowing where to put washing machine soap - just add it directly into the drum before beginning a wash cycle -and always follow instructions on packaging for exact measurements!
