## Resetting Your Heat Pump - A Step-by-Step Guide

If you’re having trouble with your heat pump, it may be time to reset the system. Resetting your heat pump is usually the easiest and quickest way to solve any issues you may be having. In this blog, we’ll discuss how to reset your heat pump in a few easy steps.

First off, you will want to turn off the power to your heat pump. Before you turn off the power, it is important to note that all settings and programming you had set on the heat pump will be reset. Disconnect the power to the pump by either unplugging the power cord or by flipping the circuit breaker. Once the power is disconnected, you will want to let the system sit for 15 minutes. This allows time for the pump to fully discharge, resetting the system and allowing you to address any issues.

Once the 15 minutes of downtime has elapsed, you will want to restore the power. Again, either plug the power cord back in or turn the circuit breaker back on. You will hear your heat pump start up and run. This process will normally last anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes and when the cycle has completed you should be good to go.

Keep in mind that if resetting your heat pump does not resolve your issue, you should contact a repair professional to diagnose and repair the issue.
