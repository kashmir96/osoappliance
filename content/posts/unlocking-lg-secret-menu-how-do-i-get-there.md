## Unlocking LG's Hidden Features: How to Access Secret Menu
The LG brand of electronic appliances have immense value and versatility, and come with many helpful features. Did you know, though, that some LG appliances can access a secret menu full of even more features? With a few steps, you can unlock these secret features on your LG products and get the most out of your appliance. 

To access the secret menu on an LG appliance, you'll need to follow a specific set of instructions that vary depending on the model and type of product. Some LG products, like air conditioners and refrigerators, require you to hit specific keys in a specific order. On many LG TVs, you need to simultaneously press multiple buttons on the remote control. In all cases, you will find a combination of buttons that need to be pressed down to activate the secret menu. 

Once you've enabled the secret menu, you'll gain access to a variety of features normally inaccessible without it. On LG TVs, for instance, the secret menu lets you set the picture mode to “Expert” and calibrate the picture, change the memory settings, and tweak the color balance. These adjustments will give your picture more accurate colors and better shadow detail, boosting picture quality. 

Accessing LG’s hidden features through the secret menu could give you access to more than just picture and memory settings. With the special menu, you can gain deeper control of the appliance, depending on the type, and find specific and detailed information about the configuration and operation of the device. 

The key to unlocking LG’s secret features is understanding the device you are using and familiarizing yourself with the sequence of buttons that activates the special menu. The process can be tricky, but once you learn the button combination and have access to the secret menu, your LG appliance will have much more to offer.
