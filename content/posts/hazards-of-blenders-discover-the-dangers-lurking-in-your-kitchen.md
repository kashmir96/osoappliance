## Risks and Dangers of Blenders in the Home

Blenders are usually among the first appliances that come to mind when thinking about common kitchen tools. Used for mixing, pureeing and emulsifying food, blenders are a multifunctional asset to the home. But as with any appliance, there are certain safety risks and dangers of having a blender in the home that need to be kept in mind. 

One of the most common hazards with blenders is malfunctioning or defective blades, leading to lacerations. As blenders process and breakup tough ingredients, their blades must remain sharp and properly fitted to avoid them becoming outdated. When this doesn't happen, the blender will start to overheat and stress the blades, causing the appliance to malfunction. Therefore, it's important to inspect your blender for any signs of wear and tear, such as blades that are misshapen, loose or bent before using it.

Another potential danger of using blenders is the lids coming loose, leading to explosive and dangerous amounts of food dispersal. To prevent this, make sure it is properly secures as you are blending ingredients. Never place your hands — or any objects — near the blender while it is operating and always be sure to use the tamper or pusher that often comes with the product.

A third risk of blenders is coming into contact with scalding hot steam or liquids that may be released when blending hot ingredients. It's recommended that you wait a minute or two before removing the top vent or lid after a warm blend to avoid getting burns. Additionally, you should never overload the blender put in too many ingredients as this can further increase pressures and potentially cause a hazardous overflow.

When using a blender, it's important to take precautions and understand the potential dangers that come with it.
