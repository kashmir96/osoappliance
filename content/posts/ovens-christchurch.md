Ovens are a common household appliance used by many Christchurch residents to cook and bake food. With the variety of ovens available, it can be difficult to choose the right one for your needs. In this blog, we’ll explore some of the types of ovens used by Christchurch residents, discuss their features and benefits, and offer tips on choosing the right oven for your home.

The most popular type of oven used in Christchurch is the electric oven. These models come in a range of sizes, from single-compartment models to double or even triple-compartment designs that make it possible to cook multiple dishes at once. Electric ovens are extremely energy efficient, making them a great choice for those looking to save money on their energy bills. They also tend to heat up quickly and provide even heat distribution throughout the cavity. Plus, they’re incredibly easy to clean and maintain.

Another type of oven used in Christchurch is the gas oven. Gas models use combustible gas as their main source of fuel, which produces higher temperatures than electric models can achieve. This makes them ideal for roasting meats or baking pizzas at high temperatures that can’t be reached with electric models alone. Gas ovens also come with an open flame setting which adds an extra layer of flavour when roasting or baking certain dishes; however they tend to be more expensive than electric models due to their increased running costs associated with using gas as fuel source. 

Finally, steam ovens are becoming increasingly popular among those looking for more health conscious cooking options. These units use steam rather than heat as the primary cooking medium which results in meals that retain more moisture and flavour while still being cooked thoroughly without added fat or oil. The biggest downside is that they take longer than traditional methods but they do provide healthy meals without sacrificing taste or texture! 

When selecting an oven for your home it’s important to consider how much space you have available as well as what types of dishes you plan on cooking regularly so you can ensure you find one that meets all your needs! Additionally, look into different brands and compare features such as temperature control capabilities, safety features (for example self-cleaning modes), ease of cleaning and maintenance requirements before deciding on any particular model so you know you’re buying something suited specifically for your needs!
