## Understanding the LG Washer 'CE' Error Code

The dreaded CE error code can be one of the most concerning of all appliance codes for the general consumer. Understanding what it means and how to approach it is key to solving the problem. Here we will explain what the CE error code means and how to fix it in an LG Washer.

The CE error code on an LG Washer indicates an issue with the motor. It may be caused by a blockage in the water path that is preventing it from draining quickly enough or by a bad connection in the motor. In either case, it is important to take the appropriate steps to fix it so the problem does not become worse or turn into a bigger fix. 

The first step in solving the CE error code on an LG Washer is to disconnect the washer from the power source. This helps to ensure that the appliance does not suffer any further damage. Next, open up the appliance and inspect any components that may be at fault such as the hoses and valves. Clean out any debris or obstructions and ensure that all valves, hoses and other parts are in working order.

Next, check the wiring of the motor for any loose or broken connections. It may be necessary to replace the motor if the wiring is faulty. If the wiring appears to be in good condition, the next step is to reset the appliance and then attempt the cycle again. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to call a technician to inspect and repair the appliance.
