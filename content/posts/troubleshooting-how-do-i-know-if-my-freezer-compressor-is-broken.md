## Is My Freezer Compressor Broken?: Troubleshooting Tips
Has your freezer suddenly stopped working? It could be due to a broken compressor, but how do you know for sure? While a quick fix might be possible for some problems, other issues, such as a broken compressor, require an experienced repair technician. Knowing when to call for help is an important part of troubleshooting your freezer.

When your freezer stops working, whether it's a chest freezer or a refrigerator/freezer combo, there are several possible causes. For instance, your appliance may be unplugged, or you may have inadvertently turned the thermostat off. Before you panic, check to make sure the appliance is connected to a power source and that your lights and knobs are in the correct positions.

If the lights are on, but the appliance isn't cooling, the problem may be with the compressor. The compressor is responsible for circulating refrigerant, or "coolant," throughout the appliance. When the compressor isn't functioning properly, the refrigerant won’t be able to circulate and the appliance won’t cool.

To determine if your freezer compressor is broken, you will need to take a more in-depth approach. If you are experienced in appliance repair, you can take off the back panel and inspect the compressor for any signs of burn marks, cracks, or damage. You should also listen for the hum of the compressor running when the appliance is plugged in and turned on.

For those of us who are not adept at major appliance repair, it is best to leave this task to the professionals. An experienced technician will inspect the appliance and check to make sure a wiring problem or circuit breaker isn’t the root cause of your troubles.

Knowing how to recognize a broken compressor can make all the difference when it comes to proper appliance care and maintenance. If you suspect your freezer compressor may be malfunctioning, make sure to locate an experienced technician who can help diagnose and fix the problem.
