## Keep Your Excalibur Dehydrator Working with Replacement Parts 

Excalibur dehydrators are great appliances for providing healthy, nutritious food options for your family. The key to keeping them working and running properly is to make sure you stay on top of the replacement parts from time to time. In this blog, we'll discuss why it's important to replace parts for your Excalibur Dehydrator and where to find the best parts for the best price. 

When it comes to home appliances, chances are you don't know when or how to replace parts, as if it's something left to the manufacturer's discretion. With an Excalibur Dehydrator, however, it's important to regularly check the seals, fan motor, and heating element. Many parts will wear down over time, and front loading the parts in time can help prevent this issue. Seals, for example, will start to crack, and can even dry out if not replaced in time. Similarly, the fan motor starts to weaken over time, and this can have an effect on overall performance. The heating element, too, will weaken over time, so always make sure it is running at the correct temperature.
