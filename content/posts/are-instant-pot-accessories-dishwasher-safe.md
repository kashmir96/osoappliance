Are you wondering if your Instant Pot accessories are dishwasher safe? If so, you’re in luck because the answer is a resounding yes! Many of the Instant Pot accessories are made from high-quality materials that can easily withstand the heat and pressure of a typical dishwasher cycle.

The most common type of Instant Pot accessory is the inner pot, which is usually made from stainless steel or ceramic. Both materials are heat and pressure resistant, so they won’t warp or degrade in your dishwasher. The same goes for other popular accessories such as steamer baskets, steam racks, and tempered glass lids. You can also safely put silicone gaskets, sealing rings, and even plastic parts in the dishwasher without fear of damage.

Of course, not all Instant Pot accessories are created equal—some may be more delicate than others. If you have any doubts about a particular item, check its documentation for specific instructions on how to clean it properly. In some cases, hand washing with mild soap and warm water may be advised over putting it in the dishwasher to ensure its longevity.

In general though, most Instant Pot accessories should be perfectly safe to wash in your machine with no ill effects on their performance or lifespan. With this knowledge at hand, you can quickly get all your cooking tools sparkling clean without having to spend hours scrubbing them by hand!
