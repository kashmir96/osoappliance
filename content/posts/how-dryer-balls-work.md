Dryer balls are an environmentally-friendly way to reduce drying time while also helping your clothes stay soft and static-free. They are usually made of wool, but can also be constructed using plastic or rubber. Essentially, they work by separating the clothes in your dryer and giving them more room to tumble around. This allows the hot air to circulate more easily and helps speed up the drying process.

In addition to reducing drying time, dryer balls can help make your laundry softer. The constant bouncing of the balls against your clothing helps soften fabrics without any harsh chemicals or fabric softeners. It also prevents clothing from bunching up in the dryer and reduces static cling caused by friction between fabrics when heated up in a dryer.

Finally, dryer balls can help you save money on energy costs since they reduce drying time significantly. The use of these little wonders is simple; just put them in with your wet laundry before you start the cycle and let them do their magic! Just remember to take them out after each load so that they donâ€™t get caught up in any folds or creases of fabric that might cause tangles or snags during future loads of laundry!
