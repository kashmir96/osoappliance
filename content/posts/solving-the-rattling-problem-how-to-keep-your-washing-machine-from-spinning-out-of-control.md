## Preventing Washing Machine Spinning Out of Control
Washing machines are an essential part of any household and much of our day-to-day life depends on them. But sometimes, wash machines can start spinning out of control leading to an annoying rattling sound as well as potential damage to the clothes and components inside. This can be a frustrating problem to manage, but there are steps you can take to fix rattling and limit the amount of clattering. 

First, washing machines require a level surface. If the machine is not even, it can cause it shake and vibrate, leading to the rattling sounds. Make sure that all four of the legs are firmly on the ground, and if so, use shims to ensure that the machine is even. This should reduce the amount of vibration and hopefully solve the problem.

If the machine is level, the issue might be an unbalanced load of laundry, which can cause the washing machine to shake and create the rattling sound. To fix this, redistribute the laundry load into one even layer and any clothes that are sticking out of the drum should be repositioned. 

If the above steps don’t fix the issue and the washing machine continues to rattle, you may need to call a professional. Our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) can help you find someone in your area that can get your machine up and running and solve your rattling problem. 

In the end, it’s important to take action to solve a rattling washing machine problem. If the machine is not even, leveled out and you redistribute the load, then you should be able to prevent the washing machine from spinning out of control and potentially damaging your clothes or components inside. However, if these steps don’t solve the problem, it’s best to turn to one of our experienced Appliance Repair Technicians to get the issues fixed the right way.
