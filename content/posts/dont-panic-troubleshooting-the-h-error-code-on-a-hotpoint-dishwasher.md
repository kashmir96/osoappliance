## Troubleshooting the h Error Code for Hotpoint Dishwasher

Have you ever encountered the dreaded "h" error code on your Hotpoint dishwasher? Don't panic - this error code is actually quite easy to troubleshoot. This article will provide you with simple steps to follow in order to quickly correct this issue.

The first step that you should take is to check the drain hose connection. This connection should be securely connected to the connection of your waste disposal unit. If the connection is loose, simply tighten the connection to the waste disposal unit and try running the dishwasher again.

The next step you should take is to check the drain pump filter. This can typically be found in the lower part of the dishwasher. Simply remove and clean the filter by rinsing it under warm running water. Along with the filter, make sure to check the surrounding area for any small objects or debris that may have gotten lodged in the drain pump. If anything is found, be sure to remove it before attempting to run the dishwasher again.

If neither of these steps prove to be effective, it might be necessary to check the wiring connecting the control panel and the main control board. If there is any damage to the wiring, your best bet would be to call a professional appliance repair technician.

In summary, troubleshooting the "h" error code on a Hotpoint dishwasher is relatively simple. By checking the drain hose connection, drain pump filter, and the wiring connecting the control panel and the main control board, you should be able to identify and resolve this issue. Should you find that the repair is too complex for you to handle, you should contact a professional appliance repair technician.
