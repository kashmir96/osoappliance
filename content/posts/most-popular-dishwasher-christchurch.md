# Most popular dishwasher in christchurch

If you are looking for the most popular dishwasher in Christchurch, you might be surprised to find out that there isn’t one single model that is the most popular. Instead, different households have different needs when it comes to dishwashers and so people choose a variety of models. That said, there are a few models that have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their excellent features and their affordability. 

One of the most popular dishwasher models in Christchurch is the Fisher & Paykel 8 DishDrawer. This model has become incredibly popular among local households due to its innovative features such as its two drawer design which allows you to fit two separate loads into one machine, as well as its ‘Rinse Aid Technology’ which helps to reduce water spots on dishes. It also offers an energy efficiency rating of A++, meaning it won’t cost much to run. 

Another very popular model is the Samsung 14 Dishwasher with Waterwall Technology. This model has been chosen by many households in Christchurch due to its advanced features such as its ‘Waterwall’ technology which helps create better cleaning results than other traditional dishwashers by creating a powerful jet of water that can easily remove food debris from dishes and pots and pans. It also offers an impressive energy efficiency rating of A+++. 

For those looking for a more budget-friendly option, then the Bosch 6 Slimline Dishwasher might be worth considering. This model has still got some great features including an adjustable water pressure setting and eco-friendly functions such as an auto off function so you won't waste any energy when not using your dishwasher. It also boasts an impressive A++ energy efficiency rating while being one of the more affordable options on this list. 

Whichever option you choose, make sure it fits your own individual needs so that you can get maximum value out of your purchase!
