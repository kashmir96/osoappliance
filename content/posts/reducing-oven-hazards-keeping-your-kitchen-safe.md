## Reducing Risks in the Kitchen with Oven Safety

Cooking with an oven is a time-honored way of making delicious food. However, it comes with inherent risks that must be taken into consideration to keep your family safe. The good news is that there are easy steps you can take to reduce oven-related hazards in your home, and keep your kitchen a safe and happy place. 

First and foremost, be sure to keep your oven clean. Grease and other food residue can build up in the oven cavities, and is a potential fire hazard. Keeping the surfaces clean, and particularly the underneath panel, will help reduce the chances of a fire occurring. Be sure to use a non-flammable cleaner, and never leave any cleaning supplies inside the oven. 

Second, make sure your oven vents are properly placed and unobstructed. This will help ensure good air flow, and reduce the risk of smoke or fumes building up in the kitchen, which could increase the chance of a fire. You should also inspect your vents periodically to ensure they are all in good condition, with no clogs or blockages. 

Third, avoid opening the door of a preheated oven. Opening an already hot oven door can cause a sudden rush of heat to escape, which can pose a burn hazard. If you need to open the oven door, make sure you do so slowly and carefully. 

Finally, make sure you are always aware of whatâ€™s inside the oven when you are heating it. Do not put any items that could ignite, such as paper towels, inside the oven. Make sure to check your food thoroughly before placing it in the oven, as any containers or other items may melt or warp. 

With a few easy steps, and some careful consideration, you can ensure a safe and hazard-free kitchen and home.
