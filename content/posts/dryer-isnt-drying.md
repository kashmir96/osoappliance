If your dryer isn't drying your clothes, it can be a hassle. Not only do you have to wait for the clothes to air dry, but you also have to worry about the potential for mold and mildew. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to diagnose and fix the issue. 

The first step is to check the lint filter. It's important to regularly clean the lint filter to ensure proper airflow. If the lint filter is clogged, it can prevent your dryer from drying your clothes.

The next step is to check the exhaust vent. This vent is located outside your home and should be cleared of any debris. If the vent is blocked, the hot air won't be able to escape, and the dryer won't be able to dry your clothes.

If the lint filter and exhaust vent are clear, the next step is to check the heating element. The heating element is responsible for heating the air that is circulated throughout the dryer. If the element is damaged or not functioning properly, the air won't get hot enough to dry the clothes.

If it is a condenser, check how full the water container is. If it is full, the water needs to be emptied. If it is empty, the condenser may need to be cleaned or replaced.

Finally, check the belt. The belt is responsible for turning the drum that tumbles the clothes. If the belt is worn or broken, the drum won't turn, and the clothes won't get dry.

If you've checked all these components and you still can't get your dryer to dry your clothes, it's time to call a professional. A qualified repair technician can diagnose the problem and make the necessary repairs.
