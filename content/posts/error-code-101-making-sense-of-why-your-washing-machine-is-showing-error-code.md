## Figuring Out the Meaning of Washing Machine Error Code 101

If your washing machine is showing an error code 101, don’t worry, you can quickly make sense of why your washing machine is displaying it. It may mean that the washer's water-level pressure switch has become unreliable, prohibiting the washer from being able to fill with the necessary amount of water. To help you determine what the issue is, we have a comprehensive appliance error codes glossary with codes and descriptions.

Error code 101 is usually one of the most common error codes found in Samsung and other brands of washing machines. This code tends to show up when your washer is unable to detect the correct water level. Common areas to check are the water supply connection, the water-level pressure switch, the power cord, and the water-level pressure switch wiring. 

If the problem appears more frequently than expected, it may indicate the water-level pressure switch needs to be replaced. This part is typically located behind the washer panels and may include screws that need to be removed. Knowing how to correctly remove the screws and install a new part can be tricky, so it’s best to contact a technician knowledgeable in washer repair if this is the case.
