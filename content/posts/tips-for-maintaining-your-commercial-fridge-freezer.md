## Keeping Your Commercial Fridge Freezer Functioning Perfectly
Ever day-to-day running of a business or a home requires an efficient refrigerator and freezer. Though commercial refrigerators and freezers are built for long-term, reliable use, there are some things that you can do to ensure it maintains its performance and is kept in good working order. 

A few key things you can do to maintain your commercial fridge freezer is to conduct regular cleaning and maintenance. It is recommended to clean both inside and outside of the unit by dusting, wiping down the exterior, and doing a full cleaning at least once a year. This includes cleaning the surfaces with a mild detergent and disinfectant. You will also want to check the door seals. Make sure that the door seals are still intact, and if not, replace them to ensure the refrigerator’s airtight seal is kept. 

In addition, it is also recommended to regularly check the temperature of both the refrigerator and the freezer. Make sure that the temperatures stay between 1 °C and 4 °C for the refrigerator and -18 °C to -15 °C for the freezer. You can ensure the coolness of your refrigerator and freezer by checking the coils or cooling elements for frost or ice buildup and if needed, defrost your freezer to ensure it is running efficiently.

Overall, with a bit of regular maintenance and monitoring, you can make sure that your commercial refrigerator or freezer is running perfectly and is up to the task of providing you with consistent and reliable cold storage.
