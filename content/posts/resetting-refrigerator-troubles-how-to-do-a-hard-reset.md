## Resetting Your Refrigerator: How to Do a Hard Reset
Resetting a refrigerator may seem like a daunting task but it doesn't have to be. A hard reset of your refrigerator can restore essential functions and get it back to optimal condition. Knowing how to do a successful hard reset is the first step.

If the ice maker on your refrigerator has stopped working, or it isn't cooling as it should, resetting it could help get it back in working order. In addition, if the temperature display is blank, a hard reset may be needed to restore the settings.

A hard reset is the simplest way to restore all the default settings, clear the memory of the control, and reset the operational state of the appliance. To perform a hard reset, begin by unplugging the power cord from the back of the refrigerator. Wait five minutes for all electrical components to completely lose power. Then plug the power cord back in and turn the unit back on. Be sure to allow the refrigerator a full twenty-four hours to completely cool down again before you begin adjusting settings. 

Cleaning the coils and condenser on the back of the refrigerator is often a necessary step in the resetting process. This should be done to prevent the refrigerator running too hot; otherwise the reset wonâ€™t be successful.
