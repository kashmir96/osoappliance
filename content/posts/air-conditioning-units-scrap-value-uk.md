Air conditioner units can be a valuable asset, but when it's time to replace them, you may be wondering what the scrap value of the old unit is. The scrap value of an air conditioning unit can vary depending on its condition and where you live in the UK. In general, however, air conditioning units have a relatively low scrap value.

The most common type of air conditioner used in homes and businesses is a split system, which consists of an external condensing unit and an indoor fan coil unit. The metal parts in these units are usually made from aluminium or steel, both of which have relatively low scrap values. For example, aluminium typically fetches around £60 per tonne at a typical UK scrapyard while steel can range between £100-£150 per tonne. To get an idea of how much your old AC system might be worth when recycled as scrap metal, multiply the weight (in tonnes) by the going rate for either aluminium or steel at your local depot or online marketplace. 
 
It’s important to note that most professional recycling companies will only accept complete AC systems for recycling due to safety regulations—they won’t accept individual components such as compressors or fans—so if you plan to sell your old AC system for scrap metal make sure it’s intact before taking it to the yard. You should also bear in mind that some yards may not accept AC systems due to their weight and size so make sure you call ahead before taking your old unit along with you. 
 
In addition to selling your used AC unit for its metal content, you may also be able to salvage valuable components such as copper pipes or wiring that could fetch more money than its weight alone when sold separately as salvage materials. To find out if this is possible with your particular model check online forums or ask someone knowledgeable about salvaging parts from used appliances such as plumbers or electricians who may be able to give advice on what components are worth keeping and where they might fetch a better price than normal scrap rates would offer. 
 
To sum up: air conditioning units generally have small amounts of valuable metals within them but these metals often don't fetch very high prices when sold as part of a larger system due to their weight and size compared with other materials like copper pipes which can fetch higher prices when sold separately as salvage materials instead; additionally many yards won't take large systems like those found in AC units so make sure you call ahead first before taking yours along with you if this is something that interests you; finally if all else fails consider donating it instead giving someone else an opportunity they wouldn’t otherwise have while helping reduce landfill waste – win-win!
