If you’re in the market for a new washing machine, you may be wondering about delivery options. Washing machine delivery is an increasingly popular option as it takes away the hassle of having to transport your new appliance home. But what do these services usually entail, what’s the cost, and what if you need someone to install your new machine? This blog post will answer all those questions and more! 

When ordering a washing machine online or from a store, many retailers offer free delivery. This usually means that a team of professionals will come to your home and deliver the appliance directly into your house (provided there is access). Some companies also offer installation services for an extra fee. 

In terms of cost, it depends on the company and distance from their warehouse but generally expect to pay around $50-$100 for delivery and installation (if applicable). The exact price can be found on their websites or by contacting them directly. 

Most companies will take away your old washing machine at no extra charge - which can be incredibly helpful when trying to dispose of an old appliance. If not, there are local companies who specialize in this service so check out reviews before making any decisions! 

Finally, if you need someone to install your new machine then that’s usually an extra service provided for an additional fee (usually around $75). It’s important to make sure you find out exactly what this involves so you know exactly what you are paying for! 

Overall, washing machine delivery is becoming increasingly popular as it takes away all the stress associated with buying large appliances like washers. Prices vary depending on company/distance but generally expect to pay between $50-$100 with some offering installation services as well. Make sure to read up on reviews before choosing any particular service provider too!
