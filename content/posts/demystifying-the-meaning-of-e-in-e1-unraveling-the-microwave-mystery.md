## Unveiling the Mystery of the 'E' and 'E1' in Microwave Nomenclature
Have you ever been confused by the use of E or E1 when looking at microwave ovens? We've all encountered a confusing product description at one point or another and understanding the meaning behind “E” in “E1” can be tedious and needlessly difficult. This blog seeks to clarify this by demystifying the meaning of “E” in “E1” in describing microwaves.

The acronym of “E” in the name “E1” describes the type of electromagnetic wave used to heat your food. This form of wave is technically known as a Short Wave Electromagnetic Wave. Such waves contain high frequency energy and powerful magnetic fields. This high energy can penetrate deep into food, heating it from within, allowing them to cook food faster than other heat sources.

E1 microwaves are becoming increasingly popular due to their high-speed cooking capabilities. Their speed allows you to cook complex recipes in a short amount of time. You can now enjoy gourmet dishes in a fraction of the amount of time it would typically take to make them.

Additionally, these microwaves are also more energy-efficient than traditional models. This makes them more affordable to run in the long run, and better for the environment too. Traditional ovens require an immense amount of energy for pre-heating, something E1s don’t have.

E1 microwaves have revolutionized the way we cook in our homes. With their ability to make complex recipes fast, they are a must have appliance in every kitchen. So, next time you're looking to buy a new microwave, make sure to look out for the “E” in “E1” and go with the more efficient and powerful option.

To get started with a purchase of your own E1 microwave oven, be sure to check out our Overview of Top Appliances and read the reviews so you can make an informed decision. This is the perfect way to find the microwave that fits your kitchen and cooking needs.
