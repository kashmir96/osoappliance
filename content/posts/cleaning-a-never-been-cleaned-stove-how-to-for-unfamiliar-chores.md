## Navigating the Task of Cleaning a Never-Been-Cleaned Stove
If you have never cleaned a stove before, the task can seem daunting. Maybe you moved into a new apartment and the stove has never been cleaned. Cleaning a stove can feel like an overwhelming chore, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. Get ready to take on the task as you follow these easy steps for cleaning your stove.

First, set aside a block of time so you can focus on cleaning your stove. This task can get tedious, so it is important to have the right attitude and remain dedicated. You can also prepare by putting on some good music.

Now it’s time to get started. Clear the stove and scrub it with a solution of soap and warm water. Use a sponge or soft cloth to make sure all the cooked-on gunk is removed. Make sure the burner grates are soaked in hot soapy water for about 10 minutes before you start scrubbing. Once all that is done, use a damp rag to wipe away any remaining residue.

Should you encounter any tough spots, use baking soda to scrub them clean. Sprinkle baking soda over the spot, then spray a cleaning solution over the baking soda. Let it sit for a few minutes before using a soft scrub brush to get rid of the remaining residue. If the area still has some buildup, you can try using a commercial oven cleaner on it.

Now that the stove is all clean, it’s time to shine it. Apply a granite cleaner to the outside of the stove. This will leave your stove looking beautiful and will also protect it from future dirt and grime build up.

Cleaning your stove shouldn’t have to be scary. Taking the time to go through these steps will ensure a clean stove that will make all your cooking endeavors much more enjoyable.
