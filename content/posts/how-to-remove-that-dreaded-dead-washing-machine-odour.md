## Getting Rid of Unpleasant Washing Machine Smells
Are you tired of the foul odour coming from your washing machine? Despite regular cleaning, sometimes a dead smell can linger, making your clothes smell bad and your laundry room unpleasant. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to get rid of the stink.

First, clean the outer parts of your washing machine with a disinfectant cleaner to remove any bacteria or dirt. You can also use a vacuum cleaner with a small hose attachment to suck up dust and dirt from all the corners and crevices. Make sure to clean and dry both the drum and the rubber seal that surrounds it.

Next, you'll want to clean the inside of the drum with a special washing machine cleaner. Many of these cleansers have special ingredients that help to remove stubborn odours. You can also use a solution of bleach and water, or a combination of baking soda, vinegar and citric acid. Soak a cloth in the cleaner, wring it out, and wipe down the walls and bottom of the drum.

Now, it's time to do a deep clean of the washing machine's filter, which accumulates dirt, detergent and mould. Unplug the machine from the electricity, and unscrew the filter from the bottom of the machine. Soak the filter for a few hours in a solution of warm water and soap, and thoroughly scrub it with a brush or dish scrubber. Once done, rinse and dry the filter, and reattach it to the washing machine.

Finally, you'll want to run a disinfecting cycle on your machine to completely remove any residual odours. Fill the drum with hot water and add in a cup of bleach or special washing machine disinfectant. This will help to remove any dirt and bacteria, and will leave your machine sparkling clean and smelling fresh.

It's important to properly clean and maintain your washing machine in order to prevent odours and bacteria buildup. Regularly use a washing machine cleaner, as well as an antibacterial solution, to keep the drum smelling and looking good. If odours are still a problem, contact a [professional appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to have a look at your machine and provide additional solutions.
