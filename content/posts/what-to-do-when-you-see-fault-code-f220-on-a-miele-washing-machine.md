## How to Respond to Fault Code F220 on a Miele Washing Machine
If you have a Miele washing machine, you may encounter a fault code F220. This code is an indication that there is an issue with the draining process. Depending on the exact issue, there are a few life hacks you can try to get your washing machine working again.

First, check the drain hose and drain filter. If the drain hose is bent, too high, or clogged, the water cannot properly leave the washing machine and can lead to a F220 fault. Make sure the drain hose is on a slight downward slope and not kinked. If the filter is blocked, remove the filter and clear away any debris or foreign objects blocking the filter.

Next, take a look at the drain and outflow pipe. If the water has nowhere to go, it will accumulate in the machine leading to a F220 fault. Make sure that the inlet pipe and drain plug are securely closed. Also check for any blockages and debris in the pipe.

If you're still having issue, you may need to reset the machine to finish the draining process. Use the on-off switch to turn the machine off and then turn it back on again. This will allow the machine to reset and attempt to complete the draining process.

If you're still having trouble with your Miele washing machine, it is advised to get expert advice. For a full list of error codes and their definitions, be sure to refer to the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). With this resource at hand, you can take the necessary steps to restore your appliance and make sure your laundry tasks are brought back to normal.
