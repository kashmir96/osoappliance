If you've ever heard a loud, high-pitched sound coming from your dryer, then you know what a squeaky dryer sounds like. A squeaky dryer is usually caused by worn out or loose parts that need to be replaced or tightened. The most common cause of a squeaky dryer is worn out drum rollers. Drum rollers are responsible for supporting the drum and allowing it to rotate freely. Over time, the rollers can become worn out and cause the drum to rub against the body of the dryer, resulting in a loud, high-pitched noise.

Another common cause of a squeaky dryer is loose or worn-out belt tension pulleys. Belt tension pulleys are responsible for keeping the belt tight and allowing it to rotate freely around the motor and drum. If these pulleys become loose or worn out, they can cause the belt to slip and create a loud squeaking noise.

Finally, a squeaky dryer can be caused by a worn-out motor bearing. Motor bearings are responsible for supporting the motor and allowing it to spin freely without any friction. If these bearings become worn out over time, they can cause the motor to rub against other components in the dryer, resulting in a loud, high-pitched noise.

If your dryer is making a loud squeaking noise, it's important that you get it checked out by an experienced technician as soon as possible. A squeaky dryer can be an indication of serious problems that need to be addressed before they become worse over time. An experienced technician will be able to identify the source of the problem and recommend any necessary repairs or replacements that need to be made in order to get your dryer running smoothly again.
