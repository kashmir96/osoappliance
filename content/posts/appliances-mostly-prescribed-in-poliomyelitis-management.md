Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a serious neurological disorder caused by a virus. It can cause permanent paralysis, breathing problems, and even death. To prevent and manage its long-term effects, a variety of medical appliances are prescribed by physicians.

One of the most common appliances prescribed in poliomyelitis management is an orthotic device. Orthotics are designed to support, align, and protect the muscles, bones, and joints of the body. They can help to correct posture, improve mobility, and reduce pain. Orthotics can be used to correct the deformities caused by polio, such as scoliosis, hip or knee contractures, and foot drop.

Another important appliance prescribed in poliomyelitis management is a wheelchair. A wheelchair can help to improve mobility and independence for people with polio, who may not have the strength or balance to walk on their own. Wheelchairs come in a variety of styles and sizes, and can be customized to meet the individual's needs.

Other appliances that are commonly prescribed in poliomyelitis management include splints, braces, and standers. Splints are used to protect weak or paralyzed muscles and joints from further injury. Braces can help to improve posture and support weakened muscles. Standers can help to improve balance, muscle tone, and coordination.

Finally, adaptive devices are often prescribed in poliomyelitis management. Adaptive devices are designed to make everyday tasks easier for people with polio. Examples include special utensils, adapted chairs, and other aids to help with eating, dressing, and bathing.

Poliomyelitis can have long-lasting effects, and the right appliances can help to improve quality of life and reduce pain. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with polio, be sure to discuss all of the available options with your doctor. With the right appliances and treatment, you can help to manage the effects of polio and live a full and active life.
