The definition of a gadget is a small device or tool that has a particular purpose. It's often used to refer to a piece of technology, such as a computer, smartphone, or other electronic device. With this definition in mind, it's easy to see why a washing machine would be considered a gadget.

A washing machine is an appliance that is designed to automatically clean clothes and other fabrics. It uses water and detergent to agitate the fabric and remove dirt, stains, and odors. Washing machines come in all shapes and sizes, from top-loading models to front-loading models. They can also be found in many different styles, such as traditional, high-efficiency, and combination washer/dryers.

The modern washing machine has been around since the late 19th century and has become an essential part of many households today. It's an incredibly useful gadget that saves time and energy when it comes to doing laundry. Not only does it save time by allowing for larger loads of laundry to be washed at once, but it also helps conserve energy by using less water than hand washing clothes would require.

Overall, it's clear that a washing machine fits the definition of a gadget perfectly other than the small requirement, as modern washing machines can be quite large. It's a useful tool that has revolutionized the way we do laundry, saving us both time and energy.
