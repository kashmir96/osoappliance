## Troubleshooting a Samsung Microwave with Error Code C

If you see a “Er.C” or “Er C” error code on your Samsung microwave, you may find yourself wondering what it means, or how to fix it. Fortunately, this code is not complex and the solutions are fairly simple. 

This code means that the defrosting system has encountered a malfunction. In most cases, this means that the door was opened or closed abruptly multiple times during a defrosting cycle. This preventing the microwave from finishing the defrosting cycle. This code is specifically referencing defrosting, so if you are using the microwave to heat food, it should not affect the functionality of the appliance.

The simplest way to fix this error code is to press the "Clear/Stop" button for 5 or 10 seconds. This will reset the error code. Additionally, after pressing "Clear/Stop" the microwave may resume the defrosting cycle for 30 seconds. The defrosting cycle will depend on the specific model of your microwave.

Finally, you can also open the microwave door for a few seconds and close it again. This should also reset the error code. This is not a fix, but can be a temporary workaround if needed. 

Error Code C on a Samsung Microwave doesn’t require a lot of work or effort to diagnose and fix. In most cases, this code is easy to troubleshoot and resolve with a few simple steps. Prior to beginning any repair work, make sure you unplug the microwave from the wall.
