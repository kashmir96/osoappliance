## Protect Yourself and Your Appliances from Exposed Cookers
When using a cooker, it is important to be aware of any potential dangers that could arise. An exposed cooker can be a potential safety hazard, as it can be installed in an area where moisture can collect, or where it could be struck by objects. Below are a few common issues that can arise when using an exposed cooker. 

### Electrical Shocks and Fire Hazards
When an exposed cooker is not installed correctly, it can create a potential electrocution risk. If there are any exposed wires that are not connected securely, they can cause a possible short circuit, leading to electric shocks, sparks and even fire hazards. 

### Flammable Materials
Another downside of using an exposed cooker is that it can become a major fire hazard if any flammable materials are placed too close to it. For example, if any fabrics or cloths are hung up near the stove, they can quickly catch fire if the cooker's heat source is not monitored correctly. 

### Leaking Gas or Water
Using an exposed cooker can also lead to potential gas or water leakage. If the cooker has not been set up securely, or any appliances connected to the cooker are faulty, there is a risk of gas or water escaping from the cooker. 

## Protect Yourself from Danger with the Right Appliance Tech
To prevent the above risks, it is essential to ensure your cooker has been installed properly. Investing in the right skill set and preventative measures can help to keep you and your family safe. To get the best out of your appliances, it is important to call in a certified appliance repair technician.

When using an exposed cooker, it is important to take a few extra steps to ensure your family is safe from any possible safety risks.
