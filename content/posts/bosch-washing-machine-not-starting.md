# Bosch washing machine not starting

If your Bosch washing machine won't start, it could be due to a variety of reasons. In order to determine the cause of the problem, you'll need to troubleshoot the machine. Here are some of the possible causes of a Bosch washing machine not starting:

1. Power Issues: The most common cause of a Bosch washing machine not starting is a power issue. Check to make sure the machine is plugged in and that the power switch is in the “on” position. If the power switch is off, turn it on and try to start the machine again.

2. Door Switch: The door switch on a Bosch washing machine prevents the machine from starting if the door is not closed properly. Check the door switch to make sure it is working properly. If it is not, you may need to replace it.

3. Water Supply: If the washing machine is not getting enough water, it will not be able to start. Check the water supply to make sure it is turned on and that there is enough water pressure.

4. Timer: The timer on a Bosch washing machine controls the length of the wash cycle. If the timer is not working properly, the machine will not start. Try resetting the timer and see if that solves the problem.

5. Motor: The motor on a Bosch washing machine powers the machine. If the motor is not working properly, the machine will not start. You may need to replace the motor brushes or the motor itself if it is not working.

If none of these solutions solve the problem, you may need to contact a professional repair technician to diagnose and repair the machine.
