## Finding a Solution to an F7 Error Code on a Whirlpool Washer

The dreaded F7 error code on a Whirlpool washer can be a nightmare for any home appliance user. Understanding what this error code means and how to fix it can be a daunting task. Learning how to diagnose and solve this problem doesn't have to be difficult; here are the basics of what needs to be done.

The F7 error code is usually related to the thermistor and its temperature readings. A thermistor is a component in modern home appliances that controls the temperature within. In a Whirlpool washer, it communicates with the electronic control board to give temperature readings and sends error codes if any signals are off.

The first step to take is to unplug the appliance to reset it and try to start it again. If that doesn't work, disconnect the thermistor and test it using a multimeter. If the thermistor checks out, then the issue may lie with the electronic control board, and it might need to be replaced.

Thankfully, there are plenty of online tutorials and step-by-step guides to troubleshoot the F7 error code. There are also many professional, experienced appliance repair technicians all across the country who can help.
