## Keeping Your Sous Vide Dish Clean and Sanitary
Maintaining sous vide equipment at an ideal standard of cleanliness is essential for producing the best possible dishes. Keeping your sous vide equipment clean is not only essential for safety but also helps to ensure that your food tastes its best. Below is a few tips and tricks to help ensure your sous vide dish is cleaned perfectly so you can enjoy delicious, safe, and healthy home cooked meals.

### Use the Appropriate Cleaners and Tools
Using the right cleaning agents and tools when cleaning your sous vide dishes can make all the difference. You should avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the surface of the material. Natural enzymes or dishwashing detergents should be a safe option and typically do the job. Additionally, you should use non-metallic scrubbing brushes, sponges, cloths, and gloves to get rid of any accumulated food particles. 

### Soaking
Soaking your sous vide dish in water can help to remove tough particles and make the cleaning process easier. You should use lukewarm water and add some dishwashing detergent, then leave the dish to soak for at least fifteen minutes. Afterwards, you can take a nonmetallic brush or sponge and gently scrub away any food particles that remain.

### Rinsing
Once you have scrubbed and cleaned the surface of the dish, it is important to properly rinse and dry it. Using hot water and a cloth or sponge, you should ensure that the entire surface of the sous vide dish is thoroughly rinsed. Finally, use a clean, dry cloth or paper towel to dry the dish.

### Sanitizing
In order to ensure a high level of cleanliness and safety, it is recommended to sanitize your sous vide dish at least twice a month. You can use a few drops of bleach-based cleaners and then let the dish soak for two to five minutes. After that, rinse the dish thoroughly with cold water and let it air dry.

By following these tips, you can help keep your sous vide dishes clean and sanitary.
