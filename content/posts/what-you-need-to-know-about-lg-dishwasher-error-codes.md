The most common LG Dishwasher error codes are E1, E4, OE, and LE. Error code E1 appears when there is a problem in the water supply. It can also occur when the water pressure falls below a certain level. Error code E4 means that the dishwasher’s water temperature is too low or too high. Error code OE indicates that there is a water overflow, which may be caused by a blocked drainage system or overloading. Error code LE appears when the load is unbalanced and the dishes are not distributed around the dishwasher properly.

In some cases, the error code may show on the display, while in other cases,it will flash on the dishwasher’s LED lights. To resolve an error code, you may need to switch off the power to the dishwasher and reset it. If this does not work, then further troubleshooting may be necessary.
