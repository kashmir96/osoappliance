## Common Error Codes in Samsung Front Load Washing Machines and How to Fix Them

Nobody loves doing laundry, but when your washing machine breaks it can be an even bigger hassle. Finding the source of the problem can be difficult and intimidating, especially when youâ€™re dealing with error codes. Fortunately, Samsung Front Load washing machine error codes are fairly straightforward and easy to diagnose and fix. 

When your Samsung Front Load washing machine displays an error code it is either to indicate a problem with the functionality of the machine or to recommend maintenance or cleaning. For example, error code nF is warning you that the washer is not filling with water. If the washer is unable to fill with water, check the hose connections and make sure that the hot and cold water faucets are turned on fully. Similarly, the HE error code will appear when the washer detects an unbalanced load of laundry. To resolve this issue, redistribute the items in the washer and restart the cycle. 

Another common problem is error code SE which signals a problem with the motor. Possible causes of this error code are a defective motor, a disconnected motor harness, a motor malfunction due to a foreign object, or serial communication being interrupted. If you are experiencing the code SE, you may need to contact a professional repair person to diagnose and fix the source of the problem. 

Error codes LE and FE refer to how your washing machine drains the water. The LE code indicates that the washer is taking too long to drain while the FE code means that the washer is unable to drain completely. These codes may appear after a previous cycle has been interrupted. To fix them, open the door to stop the washer and check for any blockages in the drain pump filter.

These are just a few of the many error codes that may appear on your front loading Samsung washing machine.
