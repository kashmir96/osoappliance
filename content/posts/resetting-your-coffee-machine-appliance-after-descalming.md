## Restarting Your Coffee Maker After Descale Procedure 

Coffee makers are fantastic pieces of technology, but they can become clogged up with mineral buildup, or limescale, over time. Descalers help remove this buildup and can keep your coffee maker running smoothly. The process should be done regularly to keep your machine performing optimally and often requires a reset of the appliance. 

To restart your coffee maker after descaling, be sure to use the correct descaler product as specified by the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Make sure all parts are properly back in their places. Many machines need to be plugged in with the power cord and power button pressed for the reset to go through. Check the instruction manual that came with the machine for exact instructions, or even for a special reset button for descaling. 

After the appliance is reset, it is important to flush the machine with fresh water. Fill the water reservoir and start the coffee maker without any ground coffee or filters inside. Let the machine run until the water reservoir is empty. Once the process is complete, fill the reservoir again and start a new cycle with ground coffee and a filter in the brew basket. 

Make sure your coffee machine is regularly descaled and reset to keep it running smoothly. Limescale can build up inside the machine and make the machine less efficient. Allowing the machine to get clogged can also drastically reduce the lifespan of the appliance. If you are having any further issues with your coffee maker, try to diagnose your problem by checking our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/).
