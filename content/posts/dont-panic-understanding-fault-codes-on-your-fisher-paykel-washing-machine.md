## Don’t Fear the Codes! Understanding Fisher & Paykel Washing Machine Faults

When a household appliance breaks down unexpectedly, it can bring your household routine to a crashing halt. Fortunately, Fisher & Paykel washing machines come with a handy fault code which can quickly help decipher what’s gone wrong and lead to a potential solution. 

When a fault occurs in your Fisher & Paykel washing machine, a fault code will display in the LED display panel. This code will provide you with three numbers indicating the area of the fault - the motor, board, or door. The code is generally 3 numbers long and the middle number in the sequence is the “1.0” or “0.1”. 

If the third number in the fault code reads ‘0’, the fault lies with the motor. Common mistakes to look for in this case include overloading the machine, items caught in the door interlock or your machine having insufficient water. 

If the third digit of the code is a ‘1’, this indicates the fault lies with the board. In this case, try unplugging the machine and plugging it back in again. If the same fault code appears, then the problem is the board.
 
If the first or last number of the code reads '2', then the fault is in the door. Possible causes of this fault could include faulty wiring in the door lock and a blocked drain filter. 

Whether you find yourself staring at a fault code or if you need help with a more serious repair, there is no need to panic. Appliance repair technicians are ready and willing to provide you with the help you need. Many of them even offer same day service and no call out fees.
