## Troubleshooting a GE Dishwasher with an H20 Error Code
If you've recently encountered an H20 error code on your GE dishwasher, you may be wondering what it means and how to fix it. Fortunately, there are some relatively easy steps you can take to troubleshoot the error and get your dishwasher back up and running. 

One of the first things to do is to turn the dishwasher off and then unplug it and remove the lower access panel. If there is any water in the base, you'll need to check the drainage pump underneath, located on the left side of the dishwasher cavity. Make sure the drain line from the pump to the disposal is clear and all clamps are secure. 

Next, look for any debris or obstructions in the chopper blade or shredder. If the blade is clogged, turn the dishwasher off and unplug the unit. Remove and clean the chopper blade and shredder, putting any small pieces into the garbage disposal. After reassembling and putting the access panel back in, plug the dishwasher back in and turn it on.

The last step is to ensure that the dishwasher has the proper amount of water. Inspect the water supply line and make sure that it is turned all the way on, then run the wash cycle and check to see if the water level rises. If it does not, you may need to adjust the water pressure valve on the supply line.

By taking these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to fix the H20 error code on your GE dishwasher. If these techniques don't work and you're still experiencing the error code, you may need to call an appliance repair technician.
