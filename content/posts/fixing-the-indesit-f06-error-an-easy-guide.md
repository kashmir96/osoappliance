## Resolving the Indesit F06 Error with Ease
Has your Indesit appliance recently thrown up the dreaded F06 error code? Fear not, as this article will take you through the process of resolving the issue step-by-step.

If you notice that your Indesit device is displaying the F06 error, the washing machine is likely stuck on a specific cycle. This is due to the machine's inability to detect the correct motor speed. In this situation, a motor tachometer must be used to reset the motor and return it to normal working order.

The first step in fixing the F06 error is to open up the control panel, which can usually be found at the back of the washing machine. Once open, locate the thermistor - this is the component responsible for detecting the machine's temperature and plays a key role in the overall operating cycle. If the thermistor is located, test the resistance by connecting a multimeter from the pins located at the back. Any unusual readings could indicate a fault.

Next, you will need to open the rear access panel to gain access to the motor. Once the panel is open, check for any signs of wear on the motor; if any are present the part needs to be replaced. Additionally, the motor must be detached from the machine and connected with a tachometer, which is a specialist device used to measure the motor's speed. If the motor speed is actioned correctly, the motor can then be reattached to the machine and re-tested.

Finally, you should ensure the F06 code has been successfully cleared. If it is still present, additional troubleshooting may be required to identify the root cause of the issue.
