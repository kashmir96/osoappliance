## My Freezer Has Stopped Working - What's Wrong?
Ever walk down to your freezer and find that your ice cream is still a gooey mess? Freezer not freezing is a common household problem, but luckily, it doesn’t have to be a permanent fix. Understanding why your freezer isn't working is the first step to diagnosing and correcting the issue.

There could be a few possible reasons why your freezer is no longer freezing efficiently. For starters, inside air circulation may be blocked by an overcrowded freezer. Make sure you are giving enough room for air to flow around each item, or else the space between them could get even warmer than the room-temperature air outside.

Another common concern is that the thermostat may no longer be working correctly. When the thermostat malfunctions, it can cause the freezer not to reach its optimal temperature, resulting in food not freezing at all. Checking the temperature setting of your thermostat and adjusting as necessary should help to resolve this issue.

It’s also possible that the problem is caused by a malfunctioning compressor or evaporator. If you’ve ruled out all other possible causes, then a malfunction in one of these components is likely the culprit. You should take your appliance for service or contact an appliance technician for assistance.
