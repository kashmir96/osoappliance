If you’ve been considering installing a microwave above your stove, you may want to think twice. Although it may seem convenient to have both appliances in the same area, there are some potential risks involved. In this blog, we’ll discuss why a microwave above your stove is not a good idea.

The first and most obvious reason why a microwave above your stove is not recommended is because of safety concerns. Having two heat sources so close together can increase the risk of fire or other accidents. The heat from the stove can easily be transferred to the microwave, which could cause it to overheat and start a fire. Additionally, any food or liquid that spills onto the hot stovetop can quickly ignite if it comes into contact with the microwave’s electrical components.

Another issue with having a microwave above your stove is that it takes up valuable counter space. This can make it difficult to prepare meals or do other kitchen tasks in an efficient manner. Additionally, having two appliances so close together can create clutter and make it harder to reach items stored on shelves or in cabinets near the area.

Finally, having a microwave above your stove may affect your cooking performance. The heat from the stove can cause food cooked in the microwave to cook unevenly and become soggy or dry out quickly. Additionally, condensation from boiling liquids on the stovetop can cause water droplets to accumulate inside the microwave and make food taste stale or soggy.

In conclusion, installing a microwave above your stove is not recommended due to safety concerns as well as potential issues with performance and counter space. It’s best to keep these two appliances separate for optimal results and safety in the kitchen!
