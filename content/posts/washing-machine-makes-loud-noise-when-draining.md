If you’ve ever had the unfortunate experience of your washing machine making loud noises when it drains, you know how annoying and disruptive it can be. The sound can range from a low hum to an almost unbearably loud roar. Fortunately, the root cause of this problem is usually quite simple and easy to diagnose.

The most common cause for a washing machine making loud noises when it drains is air being trapped in the drain line or pump. This usually happens when there are kinks or bends in the drain line that prevent water from draining properly and trap air bubbles inside. Another possible cause could be the pump itself having something stuck inside of it and preventing proper drainage, or a worn-out impeller that has lost its ability to evacuate water properly.

Fortunately, these issues are relatively simple to fix yourself before calling in an appliance repair technician from our directory. First, check your drain lines for any blockages or kinks that might be trapping air bubbles inside as this is likely causing your noise issue. Then, if necessary, remove any debris caught in the pump—this can usually be done by unscrewing the filter mesh on top of the pump housing once you have unplugged your washing machine from its power source first! 

Finally, if all else fails then you may need to replace either the impeller itself or even just get a new wash machine altogether! However, we recommend checking with our directory for qualified appliance repair technicians who may be able to help identify what exactly is wrong with your washer’s drainage system based on their years of experience and expertise before deciding whether replacing parts or buying a new washer is necessary!
