When it comes to ovens, one of the most important questions is how much power they use. This is especially true in New Zealand, where energy efficiency standards are becoming increasingly important and households are seeking ways to reduce their energy bills.

The answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including the type of oven (conventional or fan-forced), its size and usage habits. However, as a general rule of thumb, an average conventional oven will use around 2kWh per hour when cooking at a moderate temperature. This means that if you were to cook for an hour at 200 degrees Celsius (392 Fahrenheit), you would be using roughly 2kWh or about 20 cents worth of electricity in New Zealand.

The power consumption for a fan-forced oven is usually higher than that for a conventional model due to its more efficient heating system; however, it can still be quite economical if used correctly. An average fan-forced oven will typically use around 3 kWh per hour when cooking at moderate temperatures - approximately 30 cents worth of electricity in New Zealand. 

It’s also important to note that the power consumption can increase significantly when you’re using higher temperatures or longer cooking times; so make sure you keep an eye on your electricity meter! 

Finally, there are some things you can do to reduce your oven’s energy usage and save money on your bills: such as preheating only when necessary, keeping the door closed during operation and ensuring proper ventilation around the appliance itself. Taking these simple steps could potentially save you hundreds of dollars over time - so why not give them a try today?

Dryer power consumption is an important issue when it comes to saving energy and reducing your electricity bill. In New Zealand, dryers are the second largest appliance in terms of energy use and contribute significantly to your overall power bill. 

The amount of power used by a dryer depends on several factors, such as size, type, efficiency rating and how often you use the machine. Most dryers consume between 1kWh and 3kWh per load, but larger models can draw up to 6 kWh per load. The more efficient the model is rated, the lower its energy consumption will be. 

In order to reduce your dryer’s energy consumption you should follow some simple steps: 
•	Choose a model with an Energy Rating label – This will help you choose a more efficient model which consumes less electricity. 
•	Clean the filter regularly – A clean filter reduces air flow resistance which in turn reduces energy consumption. 
•	Only run full loads – Running full loads ensures that the drying cycle time is kept as short as possible thus reducing electricity usage. 
•	Use low heat settings – Lowering temperature settings on your dryer will reduce its overall energy usage without sacrificing performance too much. 

By following these steps you can easily reduce your dryer’s power consumption and save money on your monthly electricity bills!"
