We've all been there – you've preheated the oven, placed your dish inside and set the timer, only to find that when it dings, your food is still not ready. It can be incredibly frustrating when your oven takes ages to cook. 

There are several factors that could be causing your oven to take longer than expected to cook. The first one is temperature accuracy. If the temperature of your oven isn't accurate, it won't reach the desired cooking temperature quickly or efficiently. To check the temperature accuracy of your oven use an oven thermometer and compare it with what's indicated on the control panel. You may need to adjust or calibrate the thermostat if there's a discrepancy.

Another issue could be poor airflow within the oven cavity itself which can cause uneven cooking results as hot air is unable to circulate properly around food items. This can often happen in older models where fans aren't powerful enough for proper ventilation or if there are any obstructions blocking airflow within the cavity such as racks or trays being placed too close together. To solve this you'll need to make sure that nothing is blocking air from circulating freely throughout the interior of your oven and also ensure that shelves and racks are placed at least an inch apart from each other for optimal air flow within the cavity itself. 

Finally, if you're using a convection setting on your oven then this could also lead to longer cooking times due to how heat is circulated differently compared with traditional baking methods where heat rises naturally from below instead of being forced inwards via a fan-assisted system like convection settings do. With convection settings you may need to reduce temperatures slightly as well as reduce cooking times by 25-30 percent compared with conventional baking methods in order for food items not become over cooked on external surfaces while still being cooked all way through internally due its more powerful heating capabilities than conventional settings offer. 

Hopefully these tips help resolve any issues you may have had regarding why your oven takes ages to cook!
