## Responsible Hair Dryer Disposal - A Guide

It's important to be mindful of how you choose to discard small household appliances like hair dryers. Releasing unused appliances into the environment may lead to harm to plants, animals, and the atmosphere. In this guide you'll learn the responsible methods for disposing of your hair dryer so you can protect the environment. 

You have a few different options for disposing of an old hair dryer. Your main source for hair dryer disposal should be your local waste management services. Most states now have detailed rules and guidelines for the proper disposal of home appliances, so check your local regulations first. Typically, you can place small home appliances like a hair dryer in the proper curbside collection container. 

If you can't locate a recycling point that accepts hair dryers, you may need to consider other options. For example, some communities have organized collection points for small appliances so you can drop off old hair dryers and other products to be properly recycled. It is also possible to purchase a specially designed mail-in recycling device for small home appliances. 

If you have the tools, some people choose to take apart their own hair dryer and manually recycles the separate pieces for reuse. This process can be complicated, potentially dangerous, and very tedious, so it’s usually best to consider other options. 

When disposing of a hair dryer on your own, it’s essential to remember that the wire power cord of most hair dryers is made of copper and aluminum and should be recycled responsibly. You may want to visit your local scrap metal center and donate the wire power cord, or search for local electronics recyclers and take the entire hair dryer. 

No matter how you choose to get rid of it, disposing of your old hair dryer in the right way is important for making sure that we protect the environment.
