## Get your Oven Back in Working Shape and Start Baking 
Stumbling upon an oven issue can be disheartening when you’re trying to get your family a delicious meal. Fear not, if you’re having common oven issues, there are likely simple solutions you can use to restore your oven to functionality. 

From inconsistent baking temperatures to strange odors, here are a few common oven issues and how to solve them to get your baking back on track. 

### Inconsistent Temperatures 
If your oven isn’t maintaining a consistent internal temperature, it’s time to get the calipers out and evaluate. Check the thermostats calibration using an oven thermometer and compare it to the temperature your oven is significantly off will indicate if the thermostat should be replaced. 

### Unresponsive Oven
If your oven's panel is unresponsive, chances are the control board has malfunctioned. A simple power reset can sometimes do the trick, otherwise it’s time to replace the board.

### No Heat 
No heat is often indicative of a malfunctioning igniter. You can check the igniter, it should be glowing orange when the oven is in use. If it’s not glowing, check the gas line leading to the oven. No gas can mean the oven’s line is clogged, or the valve may need servicing. 

### Smells Burning 
If your oven is emitting smoke or odors while in use, or immediately after use, there’s likely an issue regarding the oven’s insulation in the internal walls. If the oven is emitting these odors after a cleaning cycle, there may have been food left in the oven cavity post-cleaning. 

These are just a few of the more common oven issues you may encounter. Keeping up with maintenance, such as cleaning and replacing the oven lightbulb regularly, can help minimize oven malfunctions. 

Solving common oven issues is often a relatively easy task; however, be sure to have a professional evaluate the oven if the issue persists. With the help of an appliance repair technician, you’ll be back baking in no time.

## Common Oven Issues & Their Solutions 

1. **Why does my oven smoke?**
This is typically caused when food particles, grease and other residues build up in the oven after regular use and are not cleaned out. Clean your oven regularly to prevent this from occurring. 

2. **Why won’t my oven get hot?**
There could be several causes. Check the power connection, thermostat setting, bake element and broil element for any signs of problems. If these are all functioning properly, it could be an issue with the wiring or timer inside the oven. 

3. **What can I do if my oven is not heating evenly?**
Check the racks in the oven and make sure they are level and not blocking the circulation of hot air. Placing food items in the oven incorrectly can also prevent even heat distribution. 

4. **My oven isn’t turning on. What should I do?**
This could be due to a power issue or a problem with the heating elements. Check your circuit breaker to ensure the oven is receiving power. Or check the settings on your oven to make sure they didn’t accidentally get changed. You may also need to examine both the bake and broil elements to see if they have burnt out. 

5. **What should I do if food is baking too quickly or slowly in my oven?**
Check the thermostat setting on your oven to make sure it is accurate. Calibrate it if needed. Make sure that the food is placed on the middle rack as closer racks are likely to get more direct heat and further ones will likely get less. You could also try adjusting the thermostat settings to make sure the temperature inside the oven remains consistent.
