A fridge compressor is the powerhouse behind a refrigerator, allowing it to cool down your food and keep it fresh. It works by compressing a refrigerant gas and then releasing the pressure to turn it into a liquid. This process cools down the air inside of your refrigerator, creating an environment that keeps your food from spoiling. 

The basic principle behind how a fridge compressor works is known as the "refrigeration cycle." To start, electricity powers the compressor motor which causes two cylinders inside of the fridge to compress refrigerant gas (typically Freon). The gas is sent into one cylinder where it's compressed at high press aure and temperature. As more pressure is added, heat from this compression is released outside of the refrigerator. 

Once compressed, this hot refrigerant then travels to the condenser coil on the back of your fridge where its temperature lowers as heat is transferred through fins in this coil. The refrigerant then becomes a liquid and flows through an expansion valve which decreases its pressure and temperature even further until it becomes vapor or mist-like. 

This cold vapor enters another set of coils in front called evaporator coils within seconds afterward, absorbing any remaining heat from inside your refrigerator while evaporating itself in order to maintain its low temperature state. As soon as all heat has been absorbed from within your refrigerator,this cooled vapor goes back into one of those cylinders again where it will be compressed once again by that same electric motor leading to another cycle for cooling down even more air before coming out again through evaporator coils. 

This cycle continues over and over until you switch off or unplugged power supply from fridge which stops electric motor & hence halts entire process with immediate effect . This way ,fridge compressor helps us store our perishable items for longer period without getting spoiled .
