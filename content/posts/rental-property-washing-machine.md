Rental property washing machines are a great way to provide convenience to tenants without requiring them to purchase and maintain their own appliances. These machines can be either coin-operated or leased for a monthly fee. They come in a variety of styles and sizes, making it easy to find one that is perfect for any rental space.

Coin-operated machines are the most popular option for rental properties since they require no set up costs or maintenance fees. Tenants simply pay a minimal fee each time they use the machine, which makes it easy for property owners and managers to collect income from the machine without having to deal with any customer service issues that may arise from leasing it out.

Leased washing machines are ideal for those who want more control over their appliance, as they can choose which features they want included such as water temperature settings or higher spin cycles. The downside is that these machines often require an upfront cost and may require regular maintenance depending on usage. However, this option can also offer long-term savings if tenants decide to stay in the property long enough to make back the cost of the lease.

No matter what type of rental property washing machine you choose, there are some basic steps you should take before installation in order to ensure proper operation and safety: check with your local municipality or building codes first; inspect all electrical connections; install an appropriate drain line; mount the machine securely; test all moving parts before use; and properly store detergent out of reach from children or pets. 

Finally, keep in mind that most rental properties will have rules about how often tenants must clean out their lint filters and other parts of the washer after each use â€“ this helps prevent clogs that could lead to costly repairs down the line!
