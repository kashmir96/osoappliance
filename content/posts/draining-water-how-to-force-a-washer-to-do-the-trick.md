## Getting a Washer to Properly Drain Water
It's frustrating when a household appliance isn't performing as it should. Washing machines are no exception - when a washer won't drain water, it can be a challenge to figure out what to do. Let's take a look at how you can force your washer to do the trick.

The first thing to do when a washing machine won't drain is to check the drain hose. Clogs and bends may cause blockages that prevent the water from draining properly. Inside the hose, make sure it's not kinked or blocked by something like a toys. If you don't find anything, then flush the hose with boiling water - this often helps to dislodge whatever is blocking the hose. 

If the hose is cleared and you're still experiencing failed draining, the next step is to run a diagnostic test to determine if the issue is something more serious. Your washing machine should come with a diagnostic test mode. Typically it's just a matter of pushing and holding down a specific set of buttons (refer to your owner's manual for specifics). This mode allows you to troubleshoot common problems and can help diagnose the deeper cause of your washer's water drainage issues. 

If a more serious issue is detected, then it's time to call in a repairman. But there are some things you can do to help increase the chances of a successful repair. Before the repairman arrives, make sure to turn off everyone else in the household from using the washer. Additionally, be sure never to use any kind of additives in the machine, as these can contribute to drainage issues. 

By following the above steps, you should be able to get any washer draining properly once again. In the rare case that a more serious issue is detected, it's important to have a reliable source of appliance repair codes.
