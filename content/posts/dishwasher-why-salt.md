If you’ve ever owned a dishwasher, you’ve probably noticed a compartment labeled “salt”. But why do you need to add salt to your dishwasher?

Salt helps to soften hard water. Hard water contains a lot of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, which can leave a residue on your dishes. This residue can make it difficult for your dishwasher to clean dishes effectively. By adding salt to your dishwasher, you’re helping to reduce the amount of minerals in the water, which will help to keep your dishes clean.

Salt also helps to maintain the pH balance of your dishwasher. When the pH balance is off, your dishwasher can become less effective at cleaning dishes. Salt helps to keep the pH level in check, which will help to ensure that your dishes are getting a thorough cleaning.

Finally, salt can help to prevent lime scale buildup in your dishwasher. Lime scale is a hard, white residue that can form on the interior of your dishwasher and on your dishes. This residue can make it difficult for your dishwasher to clean dishes effectively. By adding salt, you’re helping to reduce the amount of lime scale buildup, which will help to keep your dishes clean.

So, if you’ve been wondering why you need to add salt to your dishwasher, now you know! Salt helps to soften hard water, maintain the pH balance of your dishwasher, and prevent lime scale buildup. So, make sure to add salt to your dishwasher every once in a while to keep your dishes sparkling clean!
