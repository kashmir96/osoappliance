# How to maintain a washing machine

Maintaining a washing machine is an important part of protecting your investment and ensuring that it lasts for years to come. With a little effort and some simple steps, you can keep your washing machine running smoothly for many years. Here are five tips on how to maintain a washing machine:

1. Read the manufacturer’s instructions. Each washing machine has its own individual instructions, so make sure you read them before operating your appliance. This will help you get familiar with the parts and functions of your washing machine, as well as any special precautions or maintenance procedures you should follow.

2. Clean regularly after each use. To keep your washer in top condition, wipe down the lid and exterior, remove any lint from the filter, and clean out any debris that may have collected in or around the drum or agitator area after each load of laundry is complete. 

3. Check hoses often for wear-and-tear signs such as cracks or bulges in the hoses which could lead to leaks if not immediately addressed by replacing them with new ones when needed. 
    
4. Keep your washer balanced on all four feet when not in use to reduce wear-and-tear on internal components from vibration due to an uneven surface beneath it every time it runs a cycle. 
    
5. Run occasional maintenance cycles such as hot water cycles with bleach added at least once monthly (or more depending on frequency of use) which helps eliminate dirt and grime buildup within components over time which can cause problems down the line leading to premature failures if left unchecked for too long of periods without performing proper maintenance checks at regular intervals as recommended by manufacturer’s guidelines included with purchase documentation when first purchased unit off store display shelf upon original purchase date in store location near you nearest address area zip code geolocation based mapping grid coordinates street address lookup database nearest location search geographically nearby closest service repair centers shops outlets etcetera etcetera ad infinitum . 

Following these tips will help ensure that your washing machine stays in good working order for years to come!
