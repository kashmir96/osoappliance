## Responsibly Dispose of Your Batteries in New Zealand 

Household appliances like toys, remote controls, and flashlights use potentially harmful batteries, which can damage the environment if disposed of incorrectly. Ensure you are helping the environment by following the steps to dispose of your batteries safely and legally in New Zealand. 

The Ministry for the Environment recommends people take advantage of their Local Authority service, where batteries can be disposed of safely. Household batteries such as AA and AAA, 9V and button batteries, as well as car, motorcycle, boat and watch batteries are all accepted. When taking your used batteries to one of these services, itâ€™s important to ensure they are sealed in a non-breakable container to ensure they do not leak upon disposal. 

For battery operated consumer electronics, such as computers, phones, and power tools, the Ministry for the Environment recommends taking them to qualified and certified technician for safe disposal. Additionally, the Ministry for the Environment offers local collection points for e-waste like consumer electronics, with many locations being free for the public to use. 

If you need to dispose of your batteries, do not be tempted to dispose of them in your regular rubbish bins. Not only is this dangerous, but it is totally illegal. This could result in serious penalties or fines and cause potential damage to the environment in New Zealand.
