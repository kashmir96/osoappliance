## Don't Take Dishwasher Hazards Lightly: Protect Yourself
Dishwashers are a convenient and time-saving appliance that almost any household needs. However, they can contain certain hazards that can be dangerous if not treated carefully. It’s important to be aware of these hazards and take the proper steps to ensure your safety.

Dishwasher detergents are more powerful for getting your dishes clean because of their high pH levels. This can also be hazardous as it can cause irritation to the skin, eyes and lungs, and cause burns if not handled properly. It’s important to read and follow the instructions on the detergent bottle, use gloves when dispensing detergent and store it away from young children. Additionally, the machine should be regularly inspected for any worn or missing parts and the interior should be checked for any food or accumulation of detergent scum.

Steam generated during the dishwashing process can also be hazardous. Steam coming from the openings of the dishwasher door or machine can cause burns if touched. The gasket around the door should be inspected regularly and replaced when needed. Children should be warned of the danger of touching the door when it’s in use.

Dishwasher parts, if not properly maintained, can pose fire hazards. It’s important to use the appliance as it is intended and intended purpose only. Parts such as the heating elements and coils should be inspected on a regular basis for loose wires, frayed wires or any other signs of wear that may result in a spark or short circuit. Cleaning and maintenance should only be done by a professional.

Protect yourself and those around you by understanding the hazards that the dishwasher can pose. Regularly check the machine for any warning signs, use protective clothing when handling detergent and always use the appliance in the manner that it is intended.
