When it comes to staying comfortable in your home, investing in a quality air conditioning system is key. One of the top brands for residential AC systems is Ruud. Ruud has been providing reliable cooling solutions for over 100 years, and their air conditioners are highly rated by consumers who have purchased them. 

Ruud air conditioners come in a variety of models and sizes, so there's something to meet the needs of almost any size home or budget. Many people appreciate that Ruud offers both central and ductless mini-split AC systems as well as heat pumps for year-round comfort. Plus, all their products come with Energy Star certifications for efficient performance and lower energy bills!

Consumers who have purchased Ruud air conditioners report great results when it comes to performance and reliability. They find that the systems are easy to install and operate, while also providing powerful cooling capabilities that keep homes comfortable throughout the summer months. Additionally, they appreciate the quiet operation of these units — no loud buzzing or rattling noises! 

In terms of customer service, many reviewers report that they've had good experiences working with Ruud's support staff when they've had questions about installation or needed help troubleshooting an issue with their unit. That said, some customers note that repair parts can be difficult to find if something goes wrong down the road — though this isn't necessarily unique to Ruud as many HVAC parts can be difficult to source from third parties outside of an authorized dealer network like Ruud's. 

Overall, reviews on Ruud air conditioning units are positive — customers report being pleased with their purchase overall due to its reliable performance and quiet operation while still keeping energy costs low thanks to its Energy Star certification rating!
