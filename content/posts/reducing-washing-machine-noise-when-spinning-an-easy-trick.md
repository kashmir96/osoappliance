## Reducing Noisy Washing Machine Spins - Quick and Easy!
Taking care of the appliances in your home can be challenging, and few things are more annoying than a washing machine that makes too much noise while spinning. Fortunately, there is an easy solution when dealing with a noisy washing machine that doesn't involve major repairs or calling in an expert.

The first step when seeking to reduce the noise of a washing machine's spinning cycle is to examine the machine itself. Look for any loose screws or parts that could be causing a rattling sound. Tightening the screws or reattaching any loose parts can help eliminate more of the sound. If your washing machine has a rubber belt, it could be worn or stretched, making a squeaking noise. Replacing a belt can stop this from occurring.

Next, take a look at the space around your washing machine. It may be close to walls or other machines, or sitting on an uneven surface. Ensure that the washing machine is level with the ground and that there is enough space for air to circulate to reduce vibration. Adding a rubber mat under the washing machine can also help to quieten the spin cycle. 

Finally, it’s important to make sure your washing machine is regularly maintained. Check to make sure the filter is clean, the hose isn’t blocked and that any pipes are securely connected and not leaking. If these are all in good working order, it will reduce the amount of noise your washing machine makes.
