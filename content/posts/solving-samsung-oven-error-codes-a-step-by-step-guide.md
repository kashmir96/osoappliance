## Solving Samsung Oven Error Codes
It can be frustrating when your oven is giving you an error or warning code. Experiencing an error code can feel like a big headache, but most oven codes can be solved with a few easy steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve Samsung oven error codes. 

If you’re seeing error codes on your oven’s display, the first thing you should do is reference your oven’s user manual. Your oven’s user manual will list all of the oven’s error codes with a description of what each code means. 

For instance, some codes may indicate a faulty temperature sensor or worn heating element. If a code indicates a problem with either of those issues, you should contact a certified service technician. 

Some other codes may indicate the oven’s hardware is malfunctioning and requires a reset. To reset your oven’s hardware, simply disconnect power, wait a moment and then reconnect power. If the code persists, you may need to replace the oven’s control module. 

In some cases, error codes may appear when the oven is not in use. If that's the case, the code could be an indication of a stuck button. To unstick a stuck button, press each key one by one. If the code persists, you may need to replace the oven’s power board.

Sometimes, the simplest solution can be to unplug the oven for 10-15 minutes to reset the code. This is especially true for codes that have popped up after a power outage. 

If you've tried all of the above but still can’t solve the codes, we recommend you call a certified and licensed appliance technician.

No matter what the error code is telling you it's important that you take action to resolve the issue. For added help, you can also reference our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for a full list of common oven error codes. By going through this step-by-step guide, you can easily identify, understand, and resolve Samsung oven error codes.
