## Understanding Washing Codes: What Do the Letters and Numbers Mean?
Washing codes make deciphering how to properly care for fabrics an easier task for the modern-day consumer. These codes, found on labels of clothing, rugs, drapes and even stuffed animals, provide key information about how to wash and dry those items. Understanding what these codes mean can help you protect the investment you’ve made in your furnishings and wardrobe.

Washing codes consist of letters that stand for general types of cleaning methods, from “D” for dry-cleaning to “X” for spot cleaning. There may also be a number before them to indicate the strength of the method, such as a “3” for heavy duty cleaning and “1” for a very gentle method. Those two numbers together describe a method that is in between the two on the strength scale. For example, a label showing a “2D” means that an item requires dry-cleaning with medium strength.

Symbols provide even more specific information about the type of cleaning or drying a product needs. A circle with a cross through it indicates that an item should not be washed, while a cross through a triangle lets you know not to bleach the item. A circle with a hand lets you know that the item should be spot-cleaned, while an upward and downward arrows around a number indicates if the item should be air-dried, and a square with a circle inside tells you that the item should be dry-cleaned.

By consulting the washing code on your clothing labels, you’ll be able to minimize damage to your clothing and fabrics, as well as enjoy having delightful and bright colors for years to come.
