Small appliance kitchen circuits are one of the most important elements in any electrical system. They are the primary source of power for many appliances and other devices used in the kitchen, such as microwave ovens, toasters, coffee makers, dishwashers, and refrigerators. These circuits must be properly installed and maintained to ensure safety and efficiency in your home.

A small appliance circuit typically consists of a 15-amp protected outlet located on a dedicated 20-amp branch circuit breaker. The outlet should be located within two feet of the appliance it’s supplying power to, with at least six inches of separation between outlets. Each outlet should also be labeled with its amperage rating so you know which is which when adding or replacing an appliance. 

In some cases, such as for larger kitchen appliances like a stove or oven, you may need a higher amperage circuit than what is available from a standard small appliance outlet. In this case you should consult an electrician to ensure you're wiring up the proper sized circuit for your needs. 

In addition to having the right size circuit for your appliances, it’s important that all wiring within your home is done properly by licensed electricians who understand how to safely install new wiring or update existing wiring when adding new components or making repairs. This includes using only UL-listed wires that meet code requirements and following all local codes when installing switches and outlets throughout your home 

Finally, it’s important that all outlets connected to small appliance circuits be GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected so they can quickly shut off power if there is an electrical shock hazard detected at an outlet. By following these tips you can help keep yourself safe while using electricity in your kitchen!
