# Burning smell from dryer

If you’ve ever noticed a burning smell coming from your dryer, it’s important to take action right away. This could be a sign of a serious problem that could cause a fire if left unchecked.

The most common cause of a burning smell from your dryer is lint buildup in the exhaust duct or vent. Lint is highly flammable and can easily ignite when exposed to heat, so it’s important to clean out the lint trap after every use. You should also periodically inspect the exhaust duct and vent for any blockages or clogs caused by lint buildup. If you notice any blockages, you should remove them immediately to prevent any potential fires.

Another possible cause of a burning smell from your dryer is an overheating motor or heating element. This can happen if the motor has become clogged with dust or if the heating element has worn out over time. In either case, you should have an experienced technician inspect and repair your dryer as soon as possible to avoid any potential fire hazards.

Finally, it’s also possible that the burning smell is coming from something else in your laundry room such as an electrical outlet or appliance cord that may be overheating due to poor wiring or improper use. If this is the case, you should unplug all appliances in the area and have an electrician inspect for any potential problems before plugging them back in and using them again.

No matter what the cause of your burning smell from your dryer may be, it’s important to take action right away to prevent any potential fire hazards. Make sure you clean out the lint trap after every use and periodically inspect all exhaust ducts and vents for blockages caused by lint buildup. Additionally, if you suspect that an overheating motor or heating element may be causing the issue, contact an experienced technician right away for repairs before using your dryer again.
