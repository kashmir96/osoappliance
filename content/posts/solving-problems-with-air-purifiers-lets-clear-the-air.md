## Clearing the Air with Air Purifiers

As the days of summer fill the air with a thick layer of humidity and dust, itâ€™s important to take steps to purify your air. Air Purifiers are important appliances because they provide relief from airborne allergens, help reduce irritation to the eyes and skin, and improve overall air quality. If you're considering purchasing an air purifier, or you already own one, understanding how to make the most out of this appliance can be an effective way to solve your air quality problems. 

One of the most important things to consider when shopping for an air purifier is to make sure it is energy efficient. It should be sized for the room you intend to place it in and have a filter system designed to address your own specific needs. Also, it pays to read the labels to see if the air purifier is professionally tested and certified by an accredited organization.

The best way to ensure optimal performance from your air purifier is to keep it cleaned and maintained. The filters should be checked periodically and replaced when the manufacturer recommends it. Also, the unit should be regularly vacuumed to remove accumulated dust and debris. This will help prolong the life of the air filter and allow you to capture the maximum amount of airborne particles.

Finally, it's important to remember that air purifiers are only effective if they're used in conjunction with other methods to reduce household pollution. For example, avoiding smoking indoors and not spraying harsh chemicals can help improve air quality in the home. Minimizing the use of air fresheners and other artificial fragrances can also help reduce airborne pollutants.

Air purifiers provide an effective way to reduce and control indoor air pollution. However, it's important to regularly maintain and clean the air filter on the air purifier for the best results. With proper cleaning and maintenance, you can benefit from the amazing breathing relief that a good quality air purifier provides and keep the air in your home clean and breathable.

## Solving Problems with Air Purifiers
Using an air purifier is a great way to improve the air quality in your home and office. Here are some frequently asked questions about using air purifiers to solve problems in your space: 

1. What types of pollutants do air purifiers remove?
-Standard air purifiers capture pollutants such as dust, pollen, pet dander, smoke, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Certain air purifiers are designed to specifically target ultra fine particles like dust mites, mold spores, bacteria, and viruses. 

2. How large of an area will an air purifier cover?
-The size of an air purifier's coverage area depends on the type and size of the device you purchase. Portable air purifiers are typically intended to cover a single room, though their airflow varies greatly. Larger central air purification systems cover much larger indoor spaces.
 
3. How often should I change the air purifier filter?
-Replacing the air filter in your purifier is essential in ensuring your purifier is operating optimally. Each device has a different set of instructions, so be sure to adhere to the manufacturer's recommendation for optimum air filtration performance. 

4. Is an air purifier a substitute for regular cleaning?
-No. While an air purifier can help to reduce airborne particles, it is best used as an addition to your regular cleaning routine. If a room has an excessive amount of buildup, regular cleaning is still recommended to maintain proper air quality. 

5. Are air purifiers noisy?
-Noise levels vary by brand and model, but most air purifiers operate at noise levels around 42 decibels or lower. This is similar to the sound of a running refrigerator, which is considered very quiet.
