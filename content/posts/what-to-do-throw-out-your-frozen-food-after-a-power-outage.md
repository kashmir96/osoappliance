## When a Power Outage Strikes: Throwing Out Your Frozen Food

After a power outage, one of the most difficult choices a person must make is what to do about the frozen food in their fridge or freezer. Is it still safe to eat, or should it all be thrown out? The correct answer is not a simple one, and people should understand how to properly dispose of their food when a power outage occurs.

When a power outage strikes, the food stored in a freezer or fridge should generally be safe to eat. If the food has been stored in a freezer, it should remain frozen as long as the power is out for a maximum of 4 hours. Any longer than that, and the food should be considered unsafe to eat. With a refrigerator, the food should remain cool if the power is out for no longer than 4 hours. If the power is out for more than 4 hours, then food should be discarded.

It is important to note that even if the food is safe, it may have lost some of its flavor or texture. If it is still edible, then it can be cooked and served accordingly.

When discarding food, it is important to be mindful of the environment. All food should be disposed of in a manner that is not harmful for the environment. This can include composting, recycling, or donated to a local food bank.

In the event of a power outage, it is essential to properly identify which food is still safe to eat and which is not. It may not always be obvious, so using a food thermometer can be a huge help in determining food safety. If the food has been contaminated, must throw it out.

When properly disposing of food, it is important to consider the environment and people who may need it. If the food is safe, it may be able to be donated to a food bank or used in another way that can help the community.
