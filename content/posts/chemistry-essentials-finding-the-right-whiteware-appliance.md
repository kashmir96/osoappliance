## Identifying the Chemistry Behind a Whiteware Appliance
When it comes to finding the right appliance to fit your household needs, researching a product’s chemistry is essential. The chemistry of a whiteware appliance helps determine its performance, energy efficiency, and even its lifespan. Here, we will provide an overview of the chemistry-focused considerations one should take when purchasing a whiteware appliance.

When it comes to finding the right appliance for your home, research goes beyond features and design. To get the best bang for your buck, it’s important to understand the chemical construction of a desired appliance, as this can affect performance, energy efficiency, and even the lifespan of the product.

When examining the production and design of a whiteware appliance, take into account the materials used for the internal components, external parts, and protective coatings.

The internal components of a whiteware appliance typically use steel and other metals with protective and corrosive resistant coatings. Such coatings are incredibly important, as they provide a barrier to help the internal components maintain their integrity. Coatings can also help the appliance resist scratches and dings, improving the product’s longevity.

The external parts of a whiteware appliance, such as the door, are often constructed with stainless steel, plastic, or composites. The type of material used affects the appliance's energy efficiency, as certain materials are better at retaining energy than others.

Protective coatings are also used on a whiteware appliance’s external body. These coatings are essential for preventing rust, by protecting the appliance from moisture and dust.

When shopping for a whiteware appliance, it is important you research the individual components, materials and coatings used to construct the product. Doing so can help you find the appliance that offers the best performance and energy efficiency, as well as the most durability.
