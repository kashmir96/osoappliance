## Commercial Power: How the Growth of Business is Changing the Market

The market has undergone drastic changes in recent years due to commercial developments like the growth of online shopping, artificial intelligence and big data. What this means is that big businesses are now able to take up much of the market share and gain competitive advantages over smaller businesses. As a result, it is now almost necessary for a business to be part of the commercial juggernaut if it wants to remain competitive and stay afloat in the competitive market.

The effect of this commercial juggernaut on the market has been profound. Not only has it allowed businesses to become more powerful, it has also given them an edge over small businesses who cannot compete. This has allowed large corporates to dominate the market, driving product prices down and dominating the customer base. As a result, smaller businesses have to adapt to stay competitive or be left behind.

The commercial juggernaut also affects the sales and marketing aspect of a business. With the advent of AI and big data, businesses can now analyse customer data to gain a better understanding of their target market. This allows them to target their campaigns and tailor their products more effectively to match the needs of their target customers.

On the consumer side, the ubiquitous nature of the commercial juggernaut has shifted the buying power from the consumer to the business. This has led to an increase in product pricing and an overall increase in costs for the consumer. For example, the cost of buying a product online is more than buying it in-store. Furthermore, customers now have to be very aware of the details of any product they are considering buying and take greater responsibility for understanding the product and its associated costs.

The commercial juggernaut is continuing to shape the market, and smaller businesses need to pay attention and stay competitive. To do this, they need to consider their customer base, tailor their products to meet consumer needs, and remain aware of the impact of the commercial juggernaut on the market.
