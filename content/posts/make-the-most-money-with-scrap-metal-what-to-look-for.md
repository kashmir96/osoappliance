## Maximize Your Earnings from Scrap Metal 
Scrap metal is a great way to make some extra cash. Whether you're strolling around your neighborhood or tasked with getting rid of old appliances, it pays to know what and how to collect it. So how can you maximize your profits from scrap metal?

Start by researching what types of scrap are the most valuable in your area. Often, the higher value items are found at junkyards or appliance stores. You can also find local scrap metal companies willing to purchase scrap metal directly, so call around to find out their prices.

When it comes to metal appliances, the most valuable components are the scrap steel and iron. If you're collecting old refrigerators, dryers and washing machines, these metals will be the most valuable. These include mainframes, internal components and metal housings, motors, and wiring. Scrap aluminum can also be sold at a higher rate, so keep an eye out for aluminum paneling, wiring, doors and furniture.

To further maximize your earnings, inspect appliance for metal pieces that may be tucked away and hard to spot. Disconnecting washers, dryers and refrigerators is best left to the experts due to the complexity of the components and the risk of damaging the parts, so call the appropriate people if you're unable to do it yourself.

If you're looking for the best prices for scrap metals, find buyers that have easy access to stores or have contracts to take away discarded appliances and other metals. With a reliable buyer, you can also benefit from regular payments rather than simply waiting for scrap material to accumulate. 

If you're looking to make some money off scrap metal, remember to research the materials and buyers worth looking into. It pays to know what kind of metal parts are most valuable and to find reliable buyers that offer the best price.
