Washing Machine Taps in NZ are an essential part of any washing machine installation. They provide the necessary connection between the washing machine and your water supply, allowing the washer to draw in water for its cycle. Washing Machine Taps come in a variety of types and styles, such as those with a single tap or double tap, different spouts or shut off valves, as well as a number of other features.

The type of Washing Machine Tap you choose will depend on your specific needs and the design of your laundry room. For example, if you have limited space, you may want to opt for a single tap that is smaller in size but still offers the necessary functionality. On the other hand, if you have a larger laundry room then a double tap may be more suitable.

When it comes to features and functionality, Washing Machine Taps can offer different types and levels of shutoff valves or spouts that allow you to adjust the flow rate depending on your washing load. Some taps also feature an aerator built into them which helps reduce splashing from occurring during use. It's important to note that all Washing Machine Taps must meet New Zealand standards for safety and performance so be sure to read up on these before selecting one for your installation.

Finally, when it comes to installation it's important that all of the necessary parts are available before beginning work - such as mounting hardware, seals and washers - so make sure these are included with your purchase before beginning the job. Additionally, if possible find out what type of pipes are connected to your water supply so that you can select an appropriate fitting for your Washing Machine Tap. With these tips in mind you'll be able to easily select an appropriate Washing Machine Tap for your home!
