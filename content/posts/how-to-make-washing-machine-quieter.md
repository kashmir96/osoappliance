# How to make washing machine quieter

Are you annoyed by the loud noises coming from your washing machine? Is it keeping you up at night and putting a damper on your household peace and quiet? If so, you’re not alone. Washing machines can be quite loud when they’re spinning and can cause a lot of disruption. Fortunately, there are ways to make your washing machine quieter and enjoy some peace and quiet in your home.

1. Check the Balance

One of the most common causes of washing machine noise is an unbalanced drum. The off-balance load can cause the drum to move around and make a loud thumping noise. To check if the load is balanced, open the door and look inside. If it seems unevenly distributed, move the clothes around and even them out. If you’re still having issues after adjusting the balance, check to make sure the washing machine is level. An uneven surface can cause the drum to move around and make noise.

2. Clean the Filter

If your washing machine has a filter, it can become clogged over time. This can cause the motor to work harder and make the machine run noisier. To clean the filter, locate it and then turn off the power switch. Detach the filter and use a vacuum to remove any hair or debris. Once the filter has been cleaned, reattach it and turn the power switch back on.

3. Check the Hoses

Sometimes the noisy sound coming from the washing machine is caused by loose hoses. To check the hoses, switch off the power and then inspect the hoses for any signs of wear or tear. If you detect any, replace the hoses with new ones.

4. Use Less Detergent

It’s important to use the right amount of detergent when washing clothes. Too much detergent can cause too much suds and bubbles, which can create a loud noise. To prevent this, measure out the detergent and use the recommended amount.

5. Change the Drive Belt

A worn or stretched drive belt can also cause the washing machine to be noisy. To check the drive belt, switch off the power and then detach the belt. Examine it for any signs of wear and tear. If it’s in bad shape, replace it with a new one.

Making your washing machine quieter doesn’t have to take a lot of time or effort. By following these tips, you can enjoy a more peaceful home without the disruption of a loud washing machine.

6. Test the bearings
If you’ve noticed your washing machine is making a more grinding noise, this could be a sign that the bearings are failing. To test the bearings, you’ll need to put your hand in the machine and give it a spin, if they're faulty you'll be able to hear and feel them grinding. If the bearings appear to be damaged, you’ll need to replace them with new ones. This can be a complex job, so it’s best to call a professional to help.

7. Get vibration dampeners for under the feet
Vibration dampeners are a great way to reduce the noise that your washing machine makes. They’re relatively inexpensive and easy to install. All you have to do is place them underneath the feet of the washing machine to reduce vibration and noise. This is an easy and effective way to make your washing machine quieter.
