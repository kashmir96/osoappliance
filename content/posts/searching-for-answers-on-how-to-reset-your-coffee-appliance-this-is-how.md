## Learn How to Reset Your Coffee Appliance 

Did something go wrong with your coffee appliance and now you're searching for answers on how to reset it? Thankfully, it's not as hard as it may seem! 

Resetting a coffee appliance can be a simple process if you follow a few steps. The first thing to check is the user manual provided with the coffee appliance. Itâ€™s often the easiest way to find the instructions of how to reset it. However, not everyone keeps their user manual, so don't worry if you're unable to find it.

Also, you may want to check the power supply. Sometimes, the coffee appliance has simply been over- or under-powered and all it takes is a quick power reset to get it back on track. You should start by unplugging the appliance from any power source and leaving it unplugged for a few minutes, then plug it back in.

Additionally, many modern coffee appliances have their own built-in reset settings. If this is the case, it will be working with electronic controls, so it's wise to check that the appliance's settings and buttons are all in the right place.

Finally, if none of the above options work and you still need help resetting your coffee appliance, you can always check our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) too. Our Glossary will provide a complete list of error codes and steps you can take to debug the issue.
