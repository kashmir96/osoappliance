Wood burning stoves are an increasingly popular choice for home heating in Christchurch. They offer an eco-friendly and cost-effective way to heat your home and are gaining popularity with homeowners who want to reduce their energy costs and lower their carbon footprint.

Wood burning stoves are allowed in Christchurch, as long as they meet the relevant building regulations and have been installed by a qualified installer. These stoves are ideal for those who have access to wood, such as rural dwellers or those living near wooded areas. They can also be ideal solutions for people living in smaller homes or apartments, as they provide efficient heating while taking up little space.

There are many advantages to using a wood burning stove, including being able to control the amount of heat output and the ability to store heat for longer periods of time than electric or gas heating systems. Wood burning stoves can also be cheaper than traditional heating systems over time, because you don’t need to pay for electricity or gas bills each month. Additionally, wood is a renewable energy source that produces no emissions when burned correctly.

The average cost of installing a wood burning stove in Christchurch varies depending on the type of stove chosen and the size of the space it will be used in. Generally speaking, installation costs range from around $1,500 to $4,500 depending on these factors. However, this cost can be offset over time due to lower energy bills and the long-term cost savings associated with having a renewable energy source at your disposal.

Overall, wood burning stoves provide an efficient way to heat your home while reducing your carbon footprint and saving money on your energy bills over time. If you’re looking for an eco-friendly way to heat your home in Christchurch, then a wood burning stove might be right for you!
