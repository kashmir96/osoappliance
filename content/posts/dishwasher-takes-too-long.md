If your dishwasher takes too long to complete a cycle, it can be a real hassle. You may find yourself washing dishes by hand or running multiple cycles until the dishes are clean. While dishwashers are designed to work quickly and efficiently, there are many factors that can affect performance. Here are some tips for troubleshooting why your dishwasher may be taking too long: 

1. Check the Cycle Setting: Your dishwasher will take longer if you’re using a cycle that requires more time to complete. Make sure you’re selecting the most efficient cycle for your needs; this could save you time and energy in the long run. 

2. Clean Out Food Particles: If food particles become clogged in the filter, spray arm, or other parts of the appliance, it will take longer for water to reach all of your dishes during cleaning cycles. Make sure to clean out any clogs and debris regularly for optimal performance. 

3. Inspect Hoses and Connections: If hoses or connections have become loose over time, water won’t get to where it needs to go efficiently — leading to longer run times on cleaning cycles. Make sure all connections are secure and in working order before running a cycle again. 

4. Look for Blockages: The drain hose is an important part of keeping water flowing freely from your appliance during a cycle — if there’s anything blocking its path (like food chunks or pieces of plastic), it could cause delays in fill times or draining periods, both of which could lengthen overall cycle times significantly. Check around the hose thoroughly before each use and be sure nothing is blocking its path! 
 
5 . Check Water Pressure Levels: Low water pressure levels can make a huge difference when it comes to how fast your appliance runs its cycles — if pressure levels aren’t up-to-par then fill and draining times could both suffer as well as overall cleaning efficiency! Test yours with an at-home kit or call in a professional if need be! 

By following these tips, you should be able to get your dishwasher back up-and-running optimally so it doesn't take too long anymore!
