## Washer Not Spinning or Draining? Problem Solved Here

Are you stuck with a faulty washer which is either not draining or not spinning? It can be quite a hassle trying to find out how to fix itâ€” but don't worry. We will guide you through the possible reasons why your washer is misbehaving, and how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. 

The most common causes of a washer not draining or spinning are blockages in the drain hose, a faulty pump filter, or an issue with the door latch or the running phase of the cycle. Other possible causes include a malfunctioning motor or a broken drive belt.

The most effective way to identify the source of the problem is by troubleshooting one component at a time. Start by checking the drain hose for kinks or blockages. If there are none, then proceed to inspect the drain pump filter for blockages or debris that may have collected. Finally, inspect the door latch for any integrity or loose parts. 

If the above steps don't yield any results, then you can try using a meter to measure the motor windings and rule out any faults in the motor. Alternatively, you could also check if the drive belt is still functional. If the belt is severely worn out or has snapped, then it is likely the reason why the washer won't spin or drain. 

It is important to make sure that you always properly diagnose the issue before replacing any components.
