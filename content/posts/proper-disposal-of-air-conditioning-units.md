Summer is here and that means it’s time to turn on the air conditioning! But, when it’s time to upgrade or replace your unit, what should you do with the old one? Proper disposal of an air conditioning unit is essential for protecting the environment and avoiding potential safety hazards.

First, you should always check with your local government to find out what specific rules apply in your area. Some municipalities may have regulations in place that require you to use a certified recycling center for air conditioner disposal. If this is the case, the recycling center will likely take care of all necessary steps for proper disposal.

If there are no such regulations in your area, then you can safely dispose of an air conditioner yourself. The best way to do this is by separating the components into different categories: recyclable materials (such as metals), hazardous materials (such as refrigerant), and non-hazardous materials (such as insulation). Depending on where you live, each type of material may need to be disposed of differently. 

For example, refrigerant must be handled very carefully due to its environmental impact if released into the atmosphere. In most cases, a certified technician will need to remove it from the unit before it can be properly disposed of at a designated facility. Similarly, metals and other recyclable materials must also be taken to a recycling center or scrap yard so they can be reused instead of ending up in landfills. 

Finally, non-hazardous materials such as insulation can usually just be thrown away with regular household garbage – but again check with your local authorities first! By following these guidelines for proper disposal of an air conditioning unit – whether through a certified recycling center or on your own – you can help protect both our environment and our health from any potential hazards posed by these units when not handled correctly.
