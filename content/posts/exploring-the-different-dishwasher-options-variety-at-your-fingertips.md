## Making Dishwasher Shopping Easier
Buying a dishwasher can be an overwhelming process. With the wide range of options, prices, and features available, it is important to be educated about what is available so you can make an informed decision. From budget-friendly manual models to high-end dishwashers with all the bells and whistles, here is what you should know about exploring the different dishwasher options.

The first thing to consider when looking for a dishwasher is the type of model you would like to buy. Traditional models use manual door locks and fill valves and typically require manual operation. These basic models tend to be more affordable and easier to install.

High-end dishwashers offer an array of features such as adjustable racks, delayed start timings, and multiple cycle settings. These models are often larger and come with a wide range of options to fit any lifestyle. These can be more expensive but may offer better performance and save time in cleaning and drying dishes.

Consider the size of the dishwasher and the type of door installation. Counter-top dishwashers fit snugly on the counter-top and feature a drop-down door that opens and closes with a simple push. Portable dishwashers may be easily installed and removed, without the need for special tools. For most people, full-size dishwashers with a built-in door are the most convenient option.

Finally, consider the features available on the dishwasher and if they are a good fit for your household. Some features to think about include pre-rinse cycles, a built-in water softener and food disposal, energy-saving options, and safety features. Take some time to compare models and determine which features are most important to you.

There are countless dishwasher options available to fit any budget and lifestyle. With a bit of research, you can compare models and features to find the perfect model for your home.
