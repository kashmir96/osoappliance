##Preventing Washing Machine Mishaps
Nobody likes the thought of having their washing machine breakdown. The inconvenience and cost of repair can be avoided by conducting a few simple maintenance procedures. Read on to understand what common faults can cause a washing machine mishap, and steps you can take to avoid them. 

Most washing machines use several components that can cause the machine to malfunction, these include the water supply, water inlet valve, timer and motor. Understanding the common faults associated with these components can help you identify the issue.

###Water Supply
The water supply should be checked regularly to make sure it is not the cause of a washing machine fault. Any blockages, kinks or issues affecting the supply need to be addressed and solved as soon as possible in order to ensure a functioning appliance. If the supply pipe is not correctly installed then this could be a potential cause of problems.

###Water Inlet Valve
The water inlet valve is responsible for bringing water into the machine and can, in some cases, be the source of a potential fault. If the valve is not working properly then it will fail to bring in the correct amount of water which can result in insufficient cleaning of your clothing.

###Timer
Over time the timer of a washing machine can become faulty. This can cause the machine to not start or stop at the right time, leading to either incomplete washing or too-long washing cycles. In either case, the timer must be checked and possibly replaced if it is found to be faulty.

###Motor
The washing machine motor runs the drum/agitator and can become worn over time. This can lead to inefficient washing or even a complete breakdown of the machine. If the motor is suspected of being faulty then it should be checked and, if necessary, replaced as soon as possible.

By conducting regular checks and maintenance, these common faults can be avoided or identified quickly and resolved, saving you the hassle and expense of major repairs.

## Troubleshooting Frequently Asked Questions

1. What are some common causes of washing machine failure?
 - The most common causes of washing machine failure are blocked filters and pipes, leaks, broken belts, faulty motors and bearings, door lock issues, and worn out components.

2. How can I prevent washing machine problems?
 - Regular maintenance is key to preventing washing machine problems. You should clear the debris-catching filter after each use, and inspect hoses for cracks or wear and tear. Make sure the washing machine is level on the floor to prevent wobbling or an imbalance.

3. Can I fix a worn out belt, or do I need to call a professional?
 - If the belt is worn out and cannot be re-tightened, then it will need to be replaced. We recommend you hire a professional for belt replacement, as it can involve some technical know-how. 

4. What can I do if my door lock won't open?
 - If the door lock won't open try unplugging the washing machine and waiting at least ten minutes to see if the machine unlocks. You can also try pressing and holding the start/pause button for five seconds to reset the door lock.

5. Is it safe to use a washing machine if it's leaking?
 - No, you should never run a washing machine if it is leaking. Leaks can occur due to a number of issues, such as a faulty pump, loose hose, or a blocked filter. In any case, you should contact a professional to inspect and repair the washing machine before running it again.
