## Resetting Your GE Control Board Easy and Quick
Is your General Electric Control Board malfunctioning? Resetting the board can help restore it to its original settings and fix any miscellaneous issues. Here's your How-To Guide to resetting your GE Control Board.

### Step 1: Disconnect the Power
The first step is to disconnect the power from the appliance. Unplug it from the wall outlet or switch off the breaker at the breaker box. This helps prevent the risk of electric shock during the reset process.

### Step 2: Locate the Primary Control Board
Once the power is disconnected, locate the Primary Control Board. It is usually found at the back of the appliance, behind the main access panel. Using a flat-blade screwdriver or plastic pry tool, unscrew or pop off the access panel to reveal the Control Board.

### Step 3: Identify the Reset Button
Identify the Reset button on the board and make sure it is in the “on” position. It may look like a small toggle switch or red button. 

### Step 4: Press the Reset Button
Now, press and hold the Reset button for 5 to 10 seconds. This will reset the board and should restore it to its original settings. 

### Step 5: Turn the Power Back On 
Turn the power back on after the reset is complete. Make sure all appliance components are reconnected securely and turn the breaker switch on at the main circuit breaker.

Breathe a sigh of relief! Your GE Control Board is now reset and should be functioning properly.
