If you’ve recently invested in a dishwasher, you’re probably feeling excited to finally have one of these convenient and time-saving appliances in your home. But before you start loading up your dishwasher, it’s important to know what not to put in it. While dishwashers are designed to clean and sanitize your dishes, there are certain items that can damage the dishwasher, cause it to malfunction, or even create hazardous conditions.

1. Plastic Items: Most plastic items are not dishwasher safe and can easily melt or warp in the high temperatures of the dishwasher. This includes plastic containers, utensils, and even some plastic dishes. If you’re unsure whether an item is dishwasher safe, it’s best to err on the side of caution and hand wash it instead.

2. Aluminum Items: Aluminum items such as pots, pans, and utensils can discolor or become dull in the dishwasher. To keep your aluminum items looking their best, it’s best to hand wash them instead.

3. Wooden Items: Wooden items such as cutting boards and utensils can warp or crack in the dishwasher, so it’s best to hand wash them instead.

4. Cast Iron Items: Cast iron items such as pots and pans can rust in the dishwasher, so it’s best to hand wash them instead.

5. Non-Stick Cookware: Non-stick cookware can be damaged by the harsh detergents and high temperatures of the dishwasher, so it’s best to hand wash it instead.

6. China and Fine China: Fine china and porcelain dishes can easily become damaged in the dishwasher, so it’s best to hand wash them instead.

7. Hand-Painted Items: Hand-painted items such as dishes and mugs can easily become damaged in the dishwasher, so it’s best to hand wash them instead.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your dishwasher is working properly and that your dishes are being properly cleaned and sanitized.
