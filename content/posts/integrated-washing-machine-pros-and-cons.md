Integrated washing machines are a great choice if you want to maximise the space in your laundry area. They are designed to fit in with your existing kitchen or utility room cabinets and can be installed either into the wall or base of a unit. But, as with any appliance, there are both pros and cons when it comes to integrated washing machines.

The main pro of an integrated washing machine is that it allows you to make full use of the space you have available, without taking up too much room. It’s also very easy to install and can be done by most DIYers in a few hours. The machine will usually come with all necessary fittings included so all you need is some basic tools.

A further benefit is that integrated washing machines look very sleek and modern, as they blend seamlessly into their surroundings, enhancing the overall look of your kitchen or utility room. As they tend to be fairly low-profile too, they’re ideal if you have limited storage space available too. Most models also feature energy efficient programmes which help keep running costs down in the long term too – always a bonus! 

One downside of integrated washing machines is that they are not as easy to repair as standard models – this means if something goes wrong then getting it fixed may require an engineer visit as opposed to being able to do it yourself at home. This could add considerable cost onto any repairs needed so something worth keeping in mind when considering one for your home! Furthermore, due to their design, there can often be limited features available on integrated machines – such as fewer cycle options than standard models – so bear this in mind when shopping around for one that suits your needs best. 

Overall though, integrated washing machines remain popular choices with those who are looking for ways to make best use of their limited space without compromising on quality or features offered by more traditional models
