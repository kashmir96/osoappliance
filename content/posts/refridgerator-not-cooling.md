# Refridgerator not cooling

If your refrigerator isn’t cooling properly, it can be an intimidating problem to face. It’s the last thing you want in your kitchen, but fortunately, it’s usually an easy problem to diagnose and fix. Here’s a look at the common causes of a refrigerator not cooling and what you can do to get it back up and running.

If your refrigerator isn’t cooling first it’s time to check the temperature settings. Make sure that the temperature settings are correct.

The most common cause of a refrigerator not cooling is a blocked condenser coil. This is the coil located in the back of the unit and is responsible for dissipating heat. If it’s clogged, the refrigerator won’t be able to properly cool itself. To fix this, all you need to do is unplug the unit and then use a vacuum or soft brush to clean the condenser coil.

Another common cause of a refrigerator not cooling is a dirty evaporator fan. This fan is located inside the unit and circulates the cold air. If the fan becomes clogged with dust and debris, it won’t be able to circulate air properly, resulting in a refrigerator not cooling. To fix this, all you need to do is open up the refrigerator and clean the fan with a vacuum or soft brush.

Finally, if all of these things have been checked and your refrigerator still isn’t cooling properly, then it’s likely an issue with the thermostat or compressor. These are a bigger problem that may require a professional to diagnose and repair.

In conclusion, there are a few common causes of a refrigerator not cooling, such as a blocked condenser coil, a dirty evaporator fan, or incorrect temperature settings. If these aren’t the issue, then it’s likely an issue with the compressor, which will require a professional to repair.
