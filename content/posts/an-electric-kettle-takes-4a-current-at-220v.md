An electric kettle is a kitchen appliance that heats water to boiling point quickly and efficiently. It usually takes an input of 220V and 4A current. 

The 220V is the voltage needed to power the heating element in the kettle. Higher voltages mean that more energy can flow through the wire at once, allowing for quicker heating of water. The 4A current is the amount of electricity that flows through a circuit when you switch on your kettle. This current needs to be high enough to heat up the water in an efficient manner, but not so high that it causes damage to the wiring or creates dangerous levels of heat.

Inside an electric kettle, there are several components working together to heat up water quickly and safely. These include a heating element, thermal fuse and temperature control switch. The heating element is responsible for generating heat by converting electrical energy into thermal energy within seconds. The thermal fuse helps protect the wiring from overheating while also regulating how hot it gets inside the kettle while it’s plugged in; if temperatures get too high, it will shut off power until it cools down again. Lastly, there’s a temperature control switch which allows you to select your desired temperature setting as well as turn off/on your electric kettle with ease. 

Overall, electric kettles are incredibly useful kitchen appliances since they provide us with hot drinks relatively quickly and safely! By understanding how they work and why they require 220V and 4A current, you can make sure you use yours responsibly without causing any damage or injury!
