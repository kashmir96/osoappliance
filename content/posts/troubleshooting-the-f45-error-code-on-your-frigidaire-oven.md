## Debugging the F45 Error Code on Your Frigidaire Oven

When your Frigidaire oven is malfunctioning it can be incredibly frustrating. More often than not, the cause of the problem will be obvious. However, some issues are more difficult to track down - such as the notorious F45 error code. If your Frigidaire oven is displaying an F45 error code, then this blog will provide you with guidance on how to diagnose and fix it.

F45 is an oven error code indicating a problem with an oven’s temperature-sensing circuit. Its exact cause can vary depending on the oven’s model, but it typically appears when the oven’s actual temperature is below or above the desired temperature. This can be caused by a faulty temperature sensor, a relay, or a defective electronic oven control board.

It’s important to note that the F45 error code can’t be solved by simply resetting the oven. Instead, it requires a more hands-on approach. The first step is to unplug the oven and then inspect the temperature sensor’s wiring harness. If any of the wires are damaged or loose, they need to be replaced or repaired.

If the wires are all in order, then the next step is to locate and test the oven’s relay and temperature sensor. This can be done by using a multimeter to test their resistance. If the sensor isn’t working correctly, it needs to be replaced. And if the relay is found to be damaged, then it too needs to be replaced. 

Finally, if neither the sensor nor the relay are at fault, then the likely cause of the F45 error code is a defective electronic oven control board. This is often the most expensive repair for this issue, and will require a qualified technician to step in and replace the faulty component.

Dealing with an F45 error code can be a stressful process. But by following the advice in this blog, you should be able to track down the cause of the issue and take the necessary steps to fix it. If you’re still having trouble diagnosing your oven error code, then make sure to reach out to a qualified technician to help.
