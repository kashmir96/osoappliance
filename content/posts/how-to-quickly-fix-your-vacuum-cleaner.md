## Repairing Your Vacuum Cleaner in No Time

Having a malfunctioning vacuum cleaner can be inconvenient and a hassle. Small fixes are easy, but what should you do if your vacuum isn't running properly? Here are a few steps to take to quickly get your vacuum up and running again.

First, check to make sure the vacuum and power cord are plugged in properly. The power switch could also be switched off, so double check this if your vacuum isn't turning on. If all cables are plugged in, but the vacuum still won't run, a circuit breaker or fuse may have been tripped. Resetting this should get the vacuum running again.

If the above steps don't work, you should check the filter and bag, or canister inside the unit. Many times, the filter can be clogged from lots of dust or debris, making it difficult for the vacuum to pick up dirt. Replace the filter and bag, or canister if needed. This gives the vacuum more suction power and should make it run better.

Unless you're experienced in handling appliance repairs, it is probably best to leave the vacuum repairs to a qualified technician. To find a nearby repair technician, visit our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians.](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) 

In summary, make sure the power cord and switch are plugged in and turned off if needed. Check the filter and bag/canister, and replace as needed. Still having problems? It's recommended to contact an experienced repair technician to get your vacuum back up and running fast.
