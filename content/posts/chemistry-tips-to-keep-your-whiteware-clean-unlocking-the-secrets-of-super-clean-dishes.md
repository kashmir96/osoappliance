## Unlock Secrets to Super Clean Dishes with These Chemistry Tips
Nobody likes to do the dishes, and even worse when dirty dishes are not getting clean. Removing grease and grime build up requires more than just hot water and soap. Unlock the secrets to getting your whiteware super clean with these chemistry tips. 

The most important tip is to use the right detergent. Detergent is made of two main ingredients that help to dissolve grease and remove dirt, surfactants and builders. Surfactants lower the surface tension of the water and allow it to get into the grease and dirt. Builders, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, helps to dissolve the surface minerals in hard water that can react with the surfactants and impede the cleaning performance. 

Second, use hot water when washing dishes instead of cold water because hot water works to remove food faster. Hot water also helps dissolve the grease and oils which is essential to successful dishwashing. 

Third, if you have hard water it is a good idea to use a water softening product in your washing solution. This can neutralize the minerals that often cause the whiteware to appear cloudy and unclean. 

Having the proper tools can also make a big difference. Using a quality brush or sponge, such as nylon or Teflon, will help to loosen and remove caked on grease and food. We recommend washing the dishes right away after eating, as it will make it easier to wash, and also save you time in the long run. 

Finally, do not overload the dishwasher. This will prevent spills and splashes when running the dishwasher and give your dishes plenty of room to get clean.

These chemistry tips will help make those pesky dishwashing tasks easier and will ensure that your whiteware is left sparkling clean.
