## Step-by-Step Guide to Solving ER 08 Error Code on Arctic Spas
It is frustrating when your Arctic Spa stops functioning as it should. Fortunately, when it displays error code ER 08, there is a straightforward procedure to help get it back up and running. In this blog, we will provide a step-by-step guide to solving the ER 08 error code on Arctic Spas.

The first step is to check if the temperature of the spa water is below the set temperature. If it is, then the ER 08 code indicates that the heater is not enabled. When this is the case, you will need to first close the doors and turn the heater switch on. 

If the heater switch is already on, your second step is to check the fuse that is associated with the heater circuit. You can do this by testing the fuse with an ohmeter or multimeter. You can also locate the fuse box on the exterior of the spa or use the spa's control panel to locate the fuse. If the fuse needs to be replaced, it is important that you use the same type of fuse that was used when the spa was originally installed and wire it back in the exact same location.

The third step is to check the motor connections and the ground strap to confirm that they are all properly connected. If they are not connected properly, check that they are properly installed and properly secured to ensure they meet the manufacturer's specifications. If these connections are not made correctly, the spa may experience further issues. 

The fourth and final step is to remove the existing filter, clean and install a new filter into the spa. This will help clear out any debris that may be blocking the main drain line. It is also important to check and clean the sensors, impellers, and any other components related to the heating system. Once all these steps have been completed, the ER 08 code should no longer appear on the control panel of your Arctic Spa.

Solving the ER 08 error code on Arctic Spa can be tricky, but with the above steps, you should be able to get your spa running again. If, however, your spa continues to display the ER 08 code and does not respond to any of the steps above, it may require professional repair.
