## Avoiding Common Issues When Using a Robot Mower
Robot mowers are a high-tech way to keep your lawn looking healthy, vibrant and well-maintained. However, there are certain issues to be aware of that can cause the robot mower to malfunction. We'll cover the 5 most common issues to avoid when using a robot mower.

First, ensure the robot mower is able to charge correctly. This is important; without the correct charge, the robot mower won't be able to mow your lawn adequately. A good battery should last for about 40 minutes. If the battery drops below this level, the robot mower may cease to function.

Second, it's necessary to check the cutting system regularly. The blades should be sharp and not have any debris that could impede the performance. Small rocks or stones can cause the blades to break and the motor could potentially burn out.

Third, beware of unexpected obstacles. If the robot mower does not detect obstacles, it will try to move through them. This can cause the robot mower to malfunction or break. Putting up signs to clearly indicate obstacles, or putting a wire fence around certain areas, can help the robot mower avoid these issues.

Fourth, clean the robot mower so it can work effectively. Regularly clean and wipe the robot mower to ensure that there are no dirt, dust, or other debris that will impede the robot mower's performance.

Finally, ensure that the robot mower has a proper GPS connection. GPS connection is necessary for the robot mower to function accurately. If the GPS connection is not properly configured, it could lead to the robot mower becoming stuck.

Robot mowers can be a great asset when it comes to lawn maintenance, but it's important to be mindful of potential problems that can arise. Avoiding these five common issues can help you get the most out of your robot mower. In the case of a more complex issue, please contact a qualified appliance repair technician found on our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to assist you in maintaining and repairing your robot mower.

##Robot Mower Troubleshooting
1. **What is the best way to prepare my lawn for a robot mower?**<br>
It is recommended to mow and fertilize your lawn prior to setting up a robot mower. Ensure that your lawn is trimmed neat, there are no bumps and the uncut grass is no higher than 3-4 cm. Before mowing, remove any leaves, stones, branches and other materials from the lawn surface that could cause an obstruction.

2. **Can robot mowers work on steep slopes?** <br>
Robot mowers are not designed for steep slope mowing. Steep slopes can be dangerous and can damage the robot mower or cause it to malfunction. If your lawn has a steep slope, we recommend seeking another mowing solution.

3. **How often should I clean the blades of my robot mower?** <br>
It is recommended to clean the blades of your robot mower once every week or two in order to ensure optimal performance. Blades should be cleaned using a soft brush or cloth and warm soap and water.

4. **My robot mower is stuck. What should I do? ** <br>
If your robot mower is stuck, first try to reposition it from the current location. If this does not work, try to turn it off and then back on. If the mower is still stuck, then use a soft cloth or brush to clear away any debris and try again.

5. **Can a robot mower be used in rainy weather?**<br>
No, robot mowers are not designed to be used in rainy weather and should not be used in wet conditions. If it gets wet, the robot mower may become damaged or malfunction.
