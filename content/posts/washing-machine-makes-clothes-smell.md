Having a washing machine that leaves your clothes smelling bad can be incredibly frustrating. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to help resolve the issue without needing to call in an appliance repair technician. 

One of the most common causes of clothes smelling bad after coming out of the washer is excessive build-up of detergent, fabric softener, and lint. To tackle this issue, start by running a cycle on empty with hot water and one cup of white vinegar. This will help remove any residue built up inside the machine and prevent it from sticking to your clothes in future washes. Make sure you wipe down the drum and seals afterwards as well! 

Something else that could be causing your clothes to smell is a lack of proper venting or air circulation inside the machine. If this is an issue, try running a few cycles with no laundry but make sure you leave the lid open while doing so - this will help circulate air around your washer's interior components and reduce any potential odors or musty smells coming from within it. 

Finally, if all else fails then it may be time to call in an appliance repair technician from our directory. They'll have experience dealing with these types of issues and can assess what might need to be done for your particular washing machine model in order to get it back up and running properly again - allowing you to enjoy clean-smelling laundry once more!
