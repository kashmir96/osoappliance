A commercial convection oven is a type of oven designed for professional use in commercial kitchens. It is a versatile tool that can be used to bake, roast, toast, broil or steam food. Unlike traditional gas or electric ovens, convection ovens use forced hot air circulation to cook food faster and more evenly. The efficient cooking process can save time and energy while producing consistently high-quality results.

Commercial convection ovens are available in a variety of sizes and styles to suit the needs of any kitchen. Some models feature multiple functions such as rotisserie, pizza baking and discrete temperature zones for superior control over cooking processes. They often include digital programming capabilities that allow chefs to easily set precise temperatures, fan speeds and other settings for perfect results every time.

In New Zealand, there are several suppliers providing commercial convection ovens from top brands such as Rationale, CombiMaster Plus Lincat Ovens and Convotherm by Manitowoc Foodservice NZ Ltd.. These brands have been designed specifically for the hospitality sector with safety features such as automatic shut-off when doors are opened as well as built-in cleaning systems which help maintain hygiene standards within the kitchen environment. 

When investing in a commercial convection oven it’s important to consider your business’ specific needs so that you can select the best model for your kitchen’s size and menu requirements. If you need assistance finding the right solution then experienced suppliers could provide advice on the most suitable options available in NZ.
