## Quick Cleaning Tips to Get Your Home Sparkling
Doing some routine cleaning of large household appliances can help keep your home clean and safe. Not only can a little extra attention make big appliances look like new, but it can also make them more efficient and help save you money on costly repairs. Here are some quick and easy tips to help you keep your large appliances clean and shiny.

### Refrigerator
The refrigerator has some of the most difficult spots to clean because of its many crevices and surfaces. Wipe down the fridge at least once a month with a mild, non-toxic cleaner. Make sure to use a soft cloth and warm water for cleaning. Also, use a damp cloth and vinegar solution to clean the outside and use a brush and a soft cloth to remove accumulations from the door seals.

### Oven
Due to its function, your oven needs special attention to prevent burned-on grime from becoming impossible to scrub off. For a deep clean, use a specialized oven cleaner and use a sponge or stiff bristle brush for easy grime removal. For added convenience and safety, use the self-cleaning mode if the oven has one and follow the instructions in the owner's manual.

### Range Hood
The range hood, or vent hood, tends to collect grease and other residues, so it is important to keep it clean and free of dirt and grime. Clean your hood filter regularly with a mild soapy solution and rinse it completely. You can remove the hood filter and soak it in the sink before scrubbing off the chunks of grime that accumulates over time.

Cleaning your large appliances may seem like a daunting task, but following these tips will make the job quick and easy. Not only does regular cleaning improve the life of your appliances, but it also safeguards you and your family from potential hazards.

By taking the time to ensure your large appliances are kept clean, you can ensure a pleasant and safe home atmosphere. To keep everything running smoothly, don't forget to schedule preventative maintenance and repair the unit when needed.
