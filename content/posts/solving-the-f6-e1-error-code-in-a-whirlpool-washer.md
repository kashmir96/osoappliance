## Troubleshooting an f6 e1 Error in a Whirlpool Washer 

When you experience an f6 e1 error code on your Whirlpool washer, it can be a frustrating experience. But don’t panic - there are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the error on your own.

The most common cause of the f6 e1 error code is a problem with the damper assembly. The damper assembly is responsible for controlling the amount of water and detergent being released, and if it isn’t functioning correctly it can lead to the error. To resolve the issue, you'll need to open up the unit and inspect the damper assembly for any signs of damage or obstruction. If there is an issue, you may be able to clean or repair it, or you may need to replace the assembly entirely. 

If the damper assembly is not the problem, then you may need to check other parts of the washer. Start by checking the drain pump for any blockages or for any loose connections. You may also want to test the flow rate of the water line going to the washer, and ensure that the connections are in place and tight.

You may also need to reset the washer and see if that resolves the issue. To reset the machine, simply unplug it from the wall and wait for 5 minutes before plugging it back in and trying the cycle again.
