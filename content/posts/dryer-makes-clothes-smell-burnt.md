If your dryer is making your clothes smell burnt, don’t panic! While this may seem like a cause for alarm, there are actually several easy fixable causes of this problem. Before you contact a repair service, here are some tips to help you troubleshoot and get your dryer back in working condition. 

The most likely cause of burnt-smelling laundry is lint buildup in the lint trap or vent system. When lint builds up inside the dryer, it can act as an insulator and cause extreme heat build-up which can lead to burning clothing or other items. To prevent this from happening, always make sure to clean out both the lint trap and exhaust vent before each use; if possible, vacuum out the vents at least once per month. Additionally, never overload the dryer with too many items as this can also cause overheating. 

Another common reason for a burnt smell coming from your dryer is mechanical failure within its components such as motors or bearings that need replacing due to wear and tear over time. If you hear any strange noises coming from your machine during operation then it may be time to call in a professional repair service since these types of repairs require more specialized knowledge than just cleaning out clogged vents or replacing worn parts yourself. 

Finally, if your clothes still smell burnt after checking all of these potential causes then it could be an electrical issue caused by faulty wiring that needs to be inspected immediately by a qualified technician who can diagnose and repair any underlying problems with safety in mind. 

No matter what the cause of burning odors coming from your dryer might be, it’s important to address them quickly so that they don’t become worse over time and potentially lead to fires within your home or other damages caused by overloaded circuits or faulty wiring/components inside the machine itself. Always remember: when it comes to electrical appliances – safety first!
