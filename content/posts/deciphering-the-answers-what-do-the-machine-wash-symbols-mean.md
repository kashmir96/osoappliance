## Understanding Machine Care Symbols
We’ve all been there; you’re selecting a new outfit and you turn the label over to find a strange set of symbols. It can be intimidating to try and decipher what they mean. The good news is you are not alone and we are here to help you make sense of them. 

The symbols you will find on most clothing labels used in the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada and the United States, were created after a standardised set of symbols was agreed upon by manufacturers and are used as a visual aid to indicate how the garment should be washed. The symbols are based on a grid-like system where each symbol can be interpreted as a precise set of instructions for the correct care of the garment. 

For example, a square with three lines beneath it means the garment should be machine washed in cold water and no higher than 30 degrees Celsius. A triangle with a dotted line over it means that the garment should be washed using a gentle cycle and machine dried with low heat. Generally, the inner lines and circles will indicate the preferred method of drying or ironing and the highest temperate or heat that can be used safely when washing and drying. The symbols may also include symbols that indicate which type of sterilization solvent (bleach), stain removal technique, and type of drying cycle are safest for the fabric.

With knowledge of these symbols, you can take better care of your favourite garments and ensure they stay looking their best for years to come. To get started, take some time to look through the symbols on clothing labels and start deciphering the answers.
