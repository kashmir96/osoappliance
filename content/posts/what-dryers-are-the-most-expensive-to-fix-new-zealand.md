The most expensive dryers to fix in New Zealand are usually the ones with the most advanced features. These features include steam-cleaning, sensor-drying, and other advanced settings. These advanced settings require more complicated repairs and often require more expensive parts.

In addition to the cost of the parts, the labor required to repair a top-of-the-line dryer is often more expensive than a basic model. This is because the technician must be more experienced and knowledgeable in order to properly diagnose and repair the issue.

Finally, the cost of the repair can also be affected by the availability of parts. If the parts are not readily available, the technician may need to order them from overseas, which can add to the cost of the repair.
