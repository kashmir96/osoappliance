## Unravelling the Meaning of Samsung Washer's '4e' Error Code
We’ve all experienced the frustration of a home appliance malfunctioning, and a cryptic error code may add to this annoyance. Here, we’ll look at why the Samsung washer may display a ‘4e’ error code, and what can be done to solve the issue.

When a Samsung washer displays the ‘4e’ error code, it is indicating a water supply issue. The washer is unable to detect the water pressure needed to begin a cycle and will display this code as a result. These errors are fairly common and are usually caused by a blocked filter or kinked water hose.

The first step if your washer is displaying this error is to check all of the external components. Start by examining all of the hoses, then move on to the filter and pressure valve on the machine. If these are all free from any blockages, it’s likely that you need to reset the washer.

To reset your Samsung washer, start by unplugging the machine from the wall. Wait for 15 minutes, then replug the machine. This is known as a power reset, and should provide the machine with a clean slate. If the error persists, more extensive troubleshooting may be needed. If the filter is transparent and can be accessed, start by inspecting for any sediment or debris that may be blocking the water flow. It will be necessary to also check the inlet valves for any problems.

Another possible cause of the '4e' error code is electrical interference. If the washer is located near other large appliances, this can interfere with the function of the machine and throw up errors. To minimise this effect, it is recommended to keep all large appliances a few yards away from each other.

The '4e' error code indicates a water issue within the washer, but there could be other errors that arise such as a drain issue or even a faulty door lock.

With this guide, hopefully you can quickly and successfully solve your washer’s ‘4e’ error code.
