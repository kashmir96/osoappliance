If you’re looking for the model number of your GE oven, you’ve come to the right place. Knowing your model number is important when it comes to ordering replacement parts or getting product support. Fortunately, finding your model number is a relatively easy process. 

First, take a look at the oven’s control panel. Many GE ovens have a label on the inside of the door frame that contains both the model and serial numbers. If you can’t find it there, try looking on the back of the oven near the top. The model number should be printed on a label or stamped into a metal plate. 

If you still can’t locate your model number, look for other labels in your oven’s interior. The label may also be located inside one of the drawers beneath the oven or on one of its sides. You may also be able to find it printed on a tag attached to one of its wires or hoses. 

If all else fails, consult your owner’s manual or search online for a copy. The manual should contain all of the information you need to identify your GE oven, including its model and serial numbers. 

Now that you know where to find your GE oven’s model number, you can easily order parts and get product support when needed. Good luck!
