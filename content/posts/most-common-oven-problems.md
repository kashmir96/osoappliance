Ovens are an important appliance in every kitchen, so it’s important to be aware of the most common oven problems and how to diagnose and fix them. Here are some of the most common oven problems, as well as tips for repairing them:

1. Oven not heating: This is one of the most common oven problems, and usually occurs when a burner is not igniting or when a burner flame is too low. If this occurs, check all of your burners to ensure they’re lit and have a consistent flame. If any don’t light up or have an inconsistent flame, you may need to replace the burner or clean out any clogged parts on it. You may also need to check for gas leaks or blocked gas lines if your oven uses gas instead of electricity.

2. Oven temperature not accurate: This problem can occur if you notice that your food is taking longer than expected to cook or burning quickly. To fix this issue, first try recalibrating your oven’s thermostat by adjusting its temperature setting higher or lower than what you normally use. If that doesn’t work, then it could mean that there is a faulty thermometer inside the oven itself which needs replacing.

3. Door won't open/close properly: Another common issue with ovens is when their doors don't open smoothly or close tightly enough, which can lead to heat escaping from inside your appliance during cooking times and leaving food uncooked in the middle even after longer cooking times than usual due to heat loss from the door being left partially opened for too long during cooking time. To fix this problem try lubricating any hinges on the door if they appear stuck with some WD-40 lubricant spray before trying again; if all else fails then you may need professional assistance from an appliance repair technician who can take apart your door and identify why it isn't closing correctly before fixing it accordingly with new parts where needed (if available). 

4. Oven won't turn off: This is another common problem with many different types of appliances including microwaves but especially electric stoves since their elements are powered by electricity instead of gas like range top burners typically are; this means that once turned on they often stay on until manually turned off by pressing down harder on their knob switch which will cause its internal mechanism (usually made up of two metal pieces) contact one another in order for electricity flow through them thus turning off power going into element coils beneath stovetop surface plates before safety measures kick in automatically shutting down power supply completely whenever possible - however sometimes faulty wiring connections between these two metal pieces can prevent them from making contact resulting in stovetop elements staying constantly powered even after knob switch has been turned off so make sure no wires have come loose underneath knobs before calling repairman!
