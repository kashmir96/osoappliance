As technology continues to evolve, so do the appliances that make our lives easier. Dishwashers are no exception. In 2021, dishwashers have become more efficient, quieter, and easier to use than ever before. But what should you look for in a dishwasher in 2022?

First and foremost, you should look for a dishwasher that has a high energy efficiency rating. This rating indicates the amount of energy a dishwasher uses to clean dishes. Look for a dishwasher with a rating of A++ or higher, as this indicates that it will use less energy and water than models with lower ratings.

Another important consideration is noise level. Dishwashers are becoming increasingly quiet, with some models producing sound levels as low as 44 decibels. This is about the same noise level as a quiet conversation, so you wonâ€™t have to worry about your dishwasher disrupting your conversations or other activities.

Third, consider the features that come with the dishwasher. Many models now come with adjustable racks and fold-down tines, so you can customize the interior of the dishwasher to your needs. Look for models that also have adjustable water pressure and temperature settings, so you can customize the cleaning cycle to your dishes.

Finally, think about how easy the dishwasher is to use. Look for models that have intuitive controls and an easy-to-read display. Some dishwashers even come with smartphone connectivity, so you can control your dishwasher from your phone.

Overall, dishwashers have come a long way in 2021. When shopping for a dishwasher in 2022, look for models that are energy efficient, quiet, and feature-rich. With the right dishwasher, you can make your kitchen chores easier and more efficient.

Examples of dishwashers including some of the above characteristics in 2022 include: Bosch 800 Series 24" Bar Handle Dishwasher, Whirlpool WDF540PADM 24" Stainless Steel Full Console Dishwasher, and KitchenAid KDTM354DSS 24" Stainless Steel Fully Integrated Dishwasher.
