## Fixing Aggravating Noises From Your Washing Machine
Spinning and washing clothes should be a relatively soundless process, but when your washer starts to make noise, it can quickly become an aggravating nuisance. If your washing machine starts to make strange noises during its cycle, you must address it immediately. Don't wait until the problem gets worse, follow some of these tips to help you fix the noise and get your washer back in working order. 

The first thing you should do is to disassemble the washer. The internal parts are more likely to cause a noise than any outside parts. Once you have opened up the washer, look to see if any of the loose components have become dislodged or have worn out. Be sure to check the motor, the wheels, the agitator and the belts for any damage or inconsistencies. 

If you don't see any obvious problems with the loose components then you should check for signs of wear and tear. Look for signs of rust, corrosion or deterioration. If you see any signs of wear and tear, you should replace the part immediately. 

If you don't see any problems with the internal parts then you should look for any signs of corrosion or grime buildup on the outside of the washer. You can remove the grime build-up with a mild detergent and water and wipe down the washer with a soft cloth. If the grime has become lodged in any of the crevices, you may have to use a vacuum cleaner to remove it. 

Finally, if you still hear odd noises coming from your washer, it may be time to call in a professional.
