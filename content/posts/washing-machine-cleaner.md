A washing machine cleaner is a product designed to help keep your washing machine clean and running efficiently. It can be used in both front-loading and top-loading machines, and helps to remove built-up detergent residue, mildew, and other odors that can accumulate over time. Without regular cleaning, these substances can cause mold growth, reduce the effectiveness of your detergent, and even damage the internal components of your machine.

Using a washing machine cleaner is relatively easy. Most products come in either liquid or powder form. For liquid cleaners, simply pour the appropriate amount into the detergent dispenser of your washer before starting a cycle on hot water (check the instructions for specific amounts). Powder cleaners should be sprinkled directly into the drum of your machine before adding clothes and beginning a cycle on hot water. 

In addition to using a washing machine cleaner with each load of laundry, it’s also important to regularly clean out any standing water that may collect in the washer basin after use as this can be breeding ground for bacteria or mildew growth. It’s also important to leave the lid or door open when not in use so that air can circulate through it properly – this will help to prevent odors from developing as well as minimize bacteria growth. 

Using a washing machine cleaner is an essential part of keeping your washer running at its best for years to come!
