## Resetting a Dryer Fuse

Dryer fuses are a quick and easy way to power your dryer, but at some point you may run into a problem with something jammed in the machine or other issue that causes the fuse to blow. Resetting the fuse is a simple process and doesnâ€™t require any special tools or equipment. 

The most important thing to remember when resetting a dryer fuse is to make sure you have disconnected the power to the dryer and that the power is off. Once you have done that you can access the fuse box. On most models it is located on the bottom of the dryer. Once the box is open, you will see the fuse. 

To reset the fuse, simply pull it out and put it back in the same orientation it was in before. The fuse should now be reset! At this point, you can plug the power cord back in and turn the dryer back on to ensure everything is working properly.

When resetting a dryer fuse, it is important to make sure you disconnect the power from the wall and that the fuse is put back in the same orientation as it was before. This will help ensure the power is not delivered unevenly. Additionally, if the problem persists, it is best to contact a professional to make sure the problem is fixed properly.

Resetting the fuse in your dryer is a simple solution to ensure it works properly. Disconnecting the power, resetting the fuse, then plugging the power cord back in should get everything running smoothly. For further assistance, you can always contact a professional.
