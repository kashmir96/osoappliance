## Understanding the Electrical Codes for a Tankless Water Heater
Installing a tankless water heater may seem intimidating, but understanding and adhering to the electrical code required is the most important part. Keeping up with local and national codes can ensure a safe and efficient installation.

When installing a tankless water heater, the local and national electrical codes must be adhered to. The local electrical code will provide information on the minimum gauge of wire for the electric heater, the size of the electrical service, and the placement of the disconnect. National codes provide requirements for the size of the wire and its treatment when run in conduit, the capacity of the over-current protection device, the minimum size of the individual branch circuits, and the requirements for grounding. 

In addition to these codes, it is important to consider the location of the unit and how it will be used. In order to ensure the utmost safety, the tankless water heater should be installed in a well-ventilated area and away from any combustible materials. It is also important to consider the size of the circuit to be installed, as it should be appropriate to the heaterâ€™s power requirements.

Remember that following the local and national codes is not only a requirement in installing a tankless water heater, but also a critical safety measure. To ensure that your tankless water heater is installed safely and efficiently, research and understand the local and national codes before beginning installation.
