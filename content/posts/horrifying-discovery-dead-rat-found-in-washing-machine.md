## Dead Rat Unexpectedly Found in Washing Machine

It's every homeowner's worst nightmare - opening a washing machine to find a dead rat inside. Unfortunately, this situation is not nearly as rare as one would think due to the increase in rat infestations in the United States. Not only can rats cause extensive property damage, but they can also spread dangerous diseases and parasites. 

When it comes to finding a dead rat in the washing machine, the first step to take is to assess the damage to the appliance. In some cases, the rat may have caused no damage; however, it's possible for it to have caused drainage issues or a broken liner, both of which can be extremely costly to repair. As rodents often like to burrow, it's important to check the hoses and wiring for any signs of damage.

The other major concern when dealing with a dead rodent in the washing machine is the potential of contamination. Chances are that the rat brought a variety of parasites inside the machine and the area should be thoroughly disinfected. It's also important to replace any potentially contaminated cleaning products that were in use before.

It's important to remember that not all pest infestations can be managed by DIY solutions. For a permanent solution to rat problems, it is often best to contact a local pest control company. A well-trained exterminator can completely eliminate the infestation and help to prevent future cases.

When it comes to cleaning and repairing a washing machine due to a rodent infestation, it is best to contact a trusted appliance repair technician. A professional can thoroughly inspect the machine and provide advice on the best way to move forward.

In the event that a dead rat is discovered in the machine, it is important to contact a professional who can assess the damage and provide a permanent solution to the pest problem.
