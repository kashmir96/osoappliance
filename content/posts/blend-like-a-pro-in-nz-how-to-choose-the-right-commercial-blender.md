## Choosing the Best Commercial Blender for Your NZ Kitchen
Shopping for a blender can seem intimidating, but with a few simple considerations you can ensure you find the perfect model for your needs. This guide provides an overview of all the features and factors to be aware of when selecting a commercial blender for your New Zealand kitchen.

When looking for a commercial blender, size, stability, and power should be your top priorities. The larger the blender, the more ingredients you can place inside. Most blenders come in multiple sizes, while larger ones can accommodate larger batches and larger produce items. Additionally, blenders that sit on non-slip feet add another layer of safety and stability, while heavy, weighted bases improve the durability of the appliance. 

To keep up with heavy use and to properly pulverize your ingredients, you also need to consider the blender’s motor power. Take a look at the blender’s wattage, as this indicates its power. If you’re looking for a commercial blender, then look for higher wattage ratings such as 1200 or 1500 watts. This power should handle the toughest tasks you’ll be sending it.

Finally, take a look at the controls of the blender. Many commercial blenders come with a variety of options, from manual controls to digital touchscreen options. Whichever you select, be sure to look for one with a good warranty, as this is your assurance that the appliance was built to handle everyday use. 

By considering size, stability, power, and controls, you’ll be able to choose the right commercial blender for your New Zealand kitchen.
