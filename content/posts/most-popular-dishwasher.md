When it comes to finding the perfect dishwasher, there are a few features that make all the difference. From more efficient cleaning cycles to better noise levels and specialized functions, today’s dishwashers are packed with features designed to make life easier. Here's a look at some of the most popular dishwasher features on the market. 

1. Smart Cycle Technology: Smart cycle technology is designed for optimal cleaning performance. It monitors and adjusts water pressure, temperature, and wash time depending on the size and soil level of your dishes for improved efficiency. This means you can get sparkling clean results without wasting energy or water. 

2. Sensor Wash: Sensor wash helps determine how dirty your dishes are so it can adjust the cycle accordingly for best results without using excess water or energy in the process. This feature makes it easy to get perfectly clean dishes no matter how dirty they are when you put them in the machine! 

3. Steam Cleaning: Steam cleaning is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional chemical cleaners that may contain harsh ingredients that can be damaging to your health and environment over time. With steam cleaning cycles, hot steam is used instead of chemicals so you don’t have to worry about any residue being left behind on your dishes after they’re done washing! 

4. Noise Reduction Technology: Many newer models come with noise reducing technology which helps keep sound levels low while running at full power so you don’t have to worry about loud noises disrupting conversations or sleep patterns when running late-night loads of dishes! 

5. Delay Start Functionality: For those who need a little extra flexibility in their lives, delay start functionality allows users to set their dishwasher cycles up ahead of time so they can run during off-peak hours or when electricity rates might be lower than usual (such as overnight). This way you can still get all those pesky dishes washed without having to stay up late into night doing them yourself! 

Overall, dishwashers have come a long way in terms of features and functionality. From smarter cleaning cycles to noise reduction technology and even delay start functionality, there are plenty of features designed to help you get the best clean while saving time and energy. So if you’re looking for the perfect dishwasher, be sure to research these features before making your final decision!
