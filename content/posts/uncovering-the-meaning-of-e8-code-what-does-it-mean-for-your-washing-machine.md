## What Does an E8 Code Mean for Your Washing Machine?

When your washing machine displays the E8 code, it means something has gone wrong with the machine and might require some troubleshooting. It is important to know what the E8 code means and what potential steps you can take to remedy the situation. There are many potential causes of the E8 code, and this blog will help you understand what the meaning behind the E8 code is. 

The E8 code is an error code that typically appears in washing machines with electronic displays. It indicates that there is a problem with the control panel or the electronic display. In most cases, the E8 code means that the control panel needs to be reset. This can be done by unplugging the washing machine from the wall outlet, waiting 10 seconds, then plugging it back in. This will reset the control panel and get your washing machine back to normal.

If the E8 code still shows up after resetting the control panel, the issue can be more serious. This could be caused by a faulty wiring connection, an interior clog or a malfunctioning control board. It is important to contact a certified technician if the issue persists and the E8 code continues to appear. You may need to replace or reprogram the control board. 

At the end of the day, an E8 code can be an inconvenience, but they are usually a minor issue that can be resolved by resetting the control panel. It is always a good idea to contact a certified technician if the E8 code appears after resetting the control panel, as this could be a more serious issue.
