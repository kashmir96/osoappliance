## Keeping the Exterior of Your Appliances Clean and Shiny
Most of us take time to recognize the importance of regularly cleaning our kitchen appliances, like ovens and refrigerators, but did you know that the exterior of your kitchen appliances needs cleaning too? It's important to keep the exterior of both large and small appliances clean and well-maintained, to ensure they work as efficiently as possible. 

Cleaning your appliances involves more than just a quick wipe-down with your kitchen cloth. Most appliances need to be regularly cleaned with a non-abrasive cleaning product to remove any dirt or grease, as these substances can cause damage to the appliance. To ensure your appliances are kept in good condition, wipe the exterior of the appliance with a mild detergent and warm water, then dry with a clean, soft cloth. 

If you have any stainless steel or metal appliances in your kitchen, they can be wiped down with a metal cleaner or stainless steel cleaner to make them look as good as new. However, when cleaning metal appliances, be mindful not to use any abrasive scrubbers or cleaning products as they can leave scratches on the surface. Additionally, it is best to avoid any chemical-based cleaning products as the fumes can be hazardous. 

Once youâ€™re done cleaning, be sure to unplug your appliance and allow it to dry before using it again. This is an important precaution to take as it prevents any water from splattering inside the appliance and causing damage to the internal components. 

Overall, cleaning your kitchen appliances regularly and correctly is important in order to ensure they work efficiently as well as looking their best. Why not browse our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) and start refreshing your kitchen with the best appliances?
