## All You Need to Know About Error Code 1e on a Samsung Washer

Have you encountered Error Code 1e on your Samsung washing machine? If so, you’re likely feeling a bit of frustration. But the good news is there are a few simple steps you can take to identify the issue and resolve it quickly. 

When Samsung washing machines display an 1e error code, it typically points to a water drainage issue. In some cases, the issue can be resolved quite easily. For example, washing machines often take too much time to drain, which can lead to an 1e error. The most effective remedy for this is to simply reset the washing cycle.

In other cases, there may be an obstruction of some kind or a malfunctioning part that’s causing the error code. If this is the case, Samsung recommends checking the washer’s drain pump filter and hoses to determine whether they’re clogged or blocked. The filter will likely need to be cleaned if there’s excessive debris buildup while the hoses should be checked for potential kinks or sharp bends. 

You may also want to inspect all of the washer hoses and ensure that they’re firmly connected to each other as well as the machine. Samsung also recommends running a drain system test as a way to diagnose 1e errors. This will show which parts of the machine are running properly and which parts need to be replaced or repaired.

Error Code 1e on a Samsung washing machine can be a pain, but with some timely troubleshooting the issue can usually be resolved. If you’re running into Error Code 1e, start by running a reset, checking for obstructions, and inspecting the hoses and filter for clogs. If the issue persists, consider running a drain system test to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies.
