When it comes to dishwashers, Bosch is one of the most trusted names in the industry. Their dishwashers are some of the most reliable and efficient on the market, and they come with a variety of features to make your life easier. But even the best Bosch dishwasher can be made even better with a few key accessories. Here are some essential accessories for your Bosch Dishwasher: 

1. Cutlery Tray: If you’re looking for an easy way to organize all your cutlery, a cutlery tray is a must-have accessory for your Bosch Dishwasher. This handy accessory fits into the top rack of your dishwasher and allows you to organize all your utensils in an orderly fashion so they don’t get mixed up during washing cycles. 

2. Third Rack: A third rack is perfect for those who need extra space in their dishwasher for more dishes or large pots and pans that may not fit on traditional racks. This accessory adds an additional level of space so you can fit more dishes into each cycle without overcrowding them or having them come out less than perfectly clean due to lack of room during washing cycles. 

3. Silverware Basket: Silverware baskets are great accessories if you want to keep silverware organized while washing them in your Bosch Dishwasher. This handy basket fits into the bottom rack of most models and has separate compartments for each type of silverware so you don’t have to worry about them getting tangled together or being washed unevenly due to overcrowding in one compartment or another during washing cycles. 

4. Sanitize Option: The sanitize option is a great feature that helps eliminate bacteria from dishes, glasses, and other items by raising water temperature during wash cycles by up to 70°F above normal temperatures used by standard washing cycles - which helps eradicate any lingering germs from meals past! 

These are just some essential accessories that will help make using your Bosch Dishwasher even easier than before! With these items added on, you can rest assured knowing that not only will all dishes be cleaned thoroughly but also safely as well!
