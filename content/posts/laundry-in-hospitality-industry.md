Laundry in the hospitality industry is an important part of keeping facilities clean and presentable. Linens and other items that come into contact with guests or employees need to be laundered on a regular basis. In some cases, laundry may also be used to clean other areas of the facility such as carpets or floors.

There are a number of different ways to handle laundry in a hospitality setting. The most common approach is to have a staff member responsible for doing the laundry on a regular basis. In smaller facilities, this may be the only option. However, in larger facilities it may make more sense to outsource the laundry function to a third-party vendor. This can save time and manpower, and it can also help ensure that linens are properly cleaned and sanitized.

No matter how laundry is handled, it is important to have established procedures in place for ensuring that items are properly cleaned and disinfected. Employees should be familiar with these procedures, and they should also be aware of the importance of using appropriate hygiene practices when handling laundry.
