When it comes to kitchen appliances, New Zealanders have plenty of options. From the latest high-tech gadgets to tried and true classics, there’s something for every budget and taste. Here are some of the most popular kitchen appliances in New Zealand right now. 

1. Coffee Machines: In recent years, coffee machines have become a must-have for any serious home barista. With models ranging from simple pod systems to sophisticated espresso makers with built-in milk frothers, there’s an option for every coffee lover out there. 

2. Blenders: Smoothies and other blended drinks are a great way to get your daily dose of fruits and veggies – not to mention they’re delicious! High-powered blenders make it easy to whip up healthy treats in no time; just toss in the ingredients and let it do its thing! 

3. Slow Cookers: This classic appliance is still going strong after all these years, thanks largely due to its convenience factor – just set it before you leave in the morning and come home to a hot meal ready for dinner! Slow cookers can also be used for making soups, stews, roasts or casseroles with minimal effort involved on your part. 

4. Stand Mixers: If you’re an avid baker then a stand mixer may be just what you need; these powerful machines make quick work of kneading dough or mixing cake batters so you can spend more time decorating than mixing by hand! Many models even come with various attachments such as pasta makers or sausage stuffers so you can get creative in the kitchen too! 

5. Toasters: The humble yet versatile two-slice toast maker is still going strong after all these years; perfect toast every time plus lots of extra features like defrosting frozen bread or reheating cold toast makes this one worth its weight in gold at breakfast time!
