A washer dryer combo is a combination washing machine and clothes dryer in one unit. This type of appliance is popular for people with limited space, or who simply want the convenience of being able to do both laundry tasks at once. The cost of a washer dryer combo can vary greatly depending on the make and model, as well as other features it offers. 

On average, a basic washer dryer combo will cost somewhere between $800-$1,500. More expensive models can range up to $2,000 or more. Higher-end models may offer specialized drying cycles and additional features such as steam cleaning or remote control functions. 

When deciding whether or not to buy a washer dryer combo, it's important to consider how much space you have available in your home and how often you need to do laundry. If you have a small living area with limited space for two separate appliances, then this type of combination machine may be ideal for you. If you don't need both washing and drying capabilities on a regular basis then investing in two separate machines might be more economical in the long runâ€”particularly if you only use one function frequently (e.g., if your family does most of their laundry using the wash cycle only). 

It's also worth considering whether buying a new appliance will save money compared to using an existing setup like having multiple individual machines or using laundromats. Depending on your circumstances this could be worth looking into before making any final decisions about purchasing a washer dryer combo unit.
