# How to swap motor brushes on washing machine

Swapping the motor brushes on your washing machine is a relatively simple process that you can do yourself with a few common tools. In this blog, we’ll walk you through the process of swapping out the motor brushes on your washing machine.

1. Unplug the washing machine from the electrical outlet.

2. Remove the screws that connect the back panel to the washing machine.

3. Remove the back panel and locate the motor brushes. They’ll be attached to the motor with screws.

4. Unscrew the screws that hold the motor brushes in place.

5. Carefully remove the motor brushes from the motor.

6. Inspect the motor brushes for any visible signs of wear or damage. If you see any, or they seem a bit short, it’s a good indication that you need to replace them. 

7. Purchase new motor brushes that are compatible with your washing machine.

8. Insert the new motor brushes into the motor. Make sure that the contact points of the motor brushes line up with the commutator of the motor.

9. Secure the motor brushes in place with the screws or the tabs on the end of screws (depending on the type of machine you're operating).

10. Reattach the back panel and replace the screws.

11. Plug the washing machine back into the electrical outlet.

Your washing machine is now ready to use with the new motor brushes. Swapping out the motor brushes is a fairly simple process, and it should only take you a few minutes to complete.
