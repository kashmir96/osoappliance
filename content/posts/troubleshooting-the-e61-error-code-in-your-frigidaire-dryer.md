## Troubleshooting an E61 Error Code in a Frigidaire Dryer

If you get an E61 error code in your Frigidaire dryer, you may be wondering what it means and how to fix it. Don't worry, this article will give you an overview of what the error code means and what steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue.

The E61 error code in your Frigidaire dryer generally indicates that there is a faulty Thermistor or that it is not connected correctly. The Thermistor is a component in the dryer that helps regulate the temperature. Therefore, if it is not working correctly, the dryer may not heat up enough or the temperature may not be uniform.

To start off troubleshooting the E61 error code, you should first check the wiring and the connection at the terminals of the Thermistor to make sure that they are secure. If they appear to be in proper working condition, you will then need to check the resistance on the Thermistor using a multimeter. If the reading is not within the manufacturer's specified range, then it is likely that the Thermistor needs to be replaced.

If checking the wiring and the Thermistor does not resolve the issue, then the problem may be due to a faulty relay or control board. Relays are electrical switches that control the flow of electricity to certain components in the dryer and a faulty one can prevent the dryer from operating correctly. Additionally, the control board is responsible for monitoring and controlling the various operations of the dryer and if it is not functioning properly, it can lead to the E61 error code. If either of these components appear to be faulty, then it is best to have a qualified technician replace or repair them.

Troubleshooting the E61 error code in your Frigidaire dryer can seem daunting, but these steps should provide you with a good starting point to get your dryer running again. If you need help diagnosing or repairing your dryer, it is recommended that you contact a qualified technician.
