## Shopping for Second-Hand Appliances in Wellington
Are you looking to pick up a good quality second-hand appliance for your Wellington home? This guide will provide the information you need to shop for the best deals on pre-owned appliances, from where to look for them to what to consider when making the purchase.

There are plenty of sources for second-hand appliances in the Wellington region. Online classifieds like TradeMe and Facebook Marketplace, charity shops and pawn shops are all good places to start your search. For an increased selection, visit second-hand appliance stores, which are also scattered around the city and can sometimes hold rarer finds. 

When purchasing a second-hand appliance, be sure to check it thoroughly beforehand. Make sure it turns on and all parts are still intact and functioning correctly. Look closely for signs of wear and tear, and if you're unsure of the age of the item, ask the seller or dealer. Additionally, consider verifying extended warranties, as some second-hand appliances may still be covered by their original manufacturer or retailer.

Finally, it's important to properly assess the costs associated with a second-hand appliance. Repairing pre-owned items can sometimes be expensive, so be sure to factor in the costs of potential repairs, parts, and labour should the unit need maintenance or servicing after purchase.
