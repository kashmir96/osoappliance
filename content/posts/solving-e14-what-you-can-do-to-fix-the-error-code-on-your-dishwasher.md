## Fixing the E14 Error Code on Your Dishwasher

The dreaded E14 error code on your dishwasher can be a pain to deal with. No one wants to be stuck with a malfunctioning dishwasher, but it doesn’t have to be a problem when you understand what this particular code means. It is important to know that the E14 error code can refer to any of several different components inside the dishwasher, so it pays to have your model number handy to look up the specific cause of the code. Once you do, there are a few steps that can help you get your dishwasher up and running again.

The first step is to check the water supply. If the water supply to the dishwasher is blocked or restricted in any way, the E14 error code may occur. It is important to ensure that the water line or tap is open and supplies the appropriate flow rate of water to the dishwasher to avoid these issues. It’s also a good idea to check the water pressure at the dishwasher to make sure it’s within the accepted range.

If the water supply seems to be fine, then you should check the inlet valve. These small valves play an important role in controlling the flow of water into the dishwasher. If the inlet valve is blocked, the flow of water will be interrupted and the dishwasher will display the E14 error code. The valve can sometimes be cleared by running a paper clip through it to remove any debris.

The last item to check is the drain pump. If debris has clogged the drain pump, the dishwasher won’t be able to dispose of the water, resulting in the E14 error code. Cleaning the drain pump can be done by running vinegar through it to dislodge any buildup.

By running through these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue that’s causing the E14 error code on your dishwasher. Without a thorough understanding of the components that run your dishwasher, it may be helpful to seek professional assistance.
