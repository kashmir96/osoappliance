A refrigerator and a chiller are both important appliances for food storage, but the two serve different purposes. Both have the ability to cool items, but a chiller is typically more powerful and able to reach lower temperatures than a refrigerator.

A refrigerator is designed mainly for preserving food at a safe temperature over an extended period of time. For example, you would use your refrigerator to store leftovers or perishable items that need to stay fresh for days or weeks at a time. The average temperature range of a typical household refrigerator ranges from 32°F - 40°F (0°C - 4°C). This temperature range is suffice for storing foods that need to be kept cold over several days or weeks. 

On the other hand, chillers are designed to provide very low temperatures needed to store certain sensitive products like pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, cosmetics etc. Chillers are able to reach temperatures far lower than your typical household fridge and can go as low as -20ºF (-29ºC). This extreme cold allows businesses such as pharmacies and laboratories to store their products without fear of spoilage or bacterial growth due to heat exposure. 

In conclusion, while both fridges and chillers serve the purpose of cooling items down, they differ in terms of their capability and purpose. Refrigerators are mainly used in households for long-term food storage while chillers are usually used by businesses in order maintain extremely low temperatures needed for specialized products like pharmaceuticals or medical supplies.
