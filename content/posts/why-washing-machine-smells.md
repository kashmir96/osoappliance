Washing machine smells can be unappealing and off-putting, but they don't necessarily mean that the appliance needs servicing. Before you contact an appliance repair serviceman to check out your washing machine, there are a few things you should do to address any potential odors and ensure the appliance is running properly.

The most common cause of washing machine smells is mildew or mold buildup in the rubber seals and hoses. To prevent this from happening in the first place, always make sure to leave your washing machine door open when itâ€™s not in use. This allows air to circulate and helps decrease humidity levels inside the appliance. If you already have mold or mildew, use a cloth and all-purpose cleaner or white vinegar and baking soda solution to remove it from all parts of your washer. 

Another cause of unpleasant odors may be excess detergent residue left on clothing after a wash cycle is complete. To avoid this, always make sure to measure detergent accurately when filling up your washer with clothes for a load. Additionally, regularly clean out any leftover residue using white vinegar by adding one cup into an empty cycle before tossing in any clothes for a regular load of laundry. 

Finally, if after taking these steps you still find that there are offensive smells coming from your washer then it could be time to call an appliance repair serviceman who can take a look at the washer's inner components such as its drain hose connection, heating element or circulation pump motor which might need replacing due age or damage over time leading to bacteria growths inside those components resulting in those bad odors emanating from your washer once again confirming why one should check these basic things instead before calling for an Appliance Repairman directly!
