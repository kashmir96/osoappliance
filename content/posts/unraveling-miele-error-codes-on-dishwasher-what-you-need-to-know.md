If you own a Miele dishwasher, you’re likely familiar with the wide range of excellent features it can offer, from ecological options to better performance when washing dishes. But one of the things you may not be aware of is the importance of knowing what Miele dishwasher error codes indicate.

These error codes may show up when you turn on your Miele dishwasher, or they might disrupt the regular operation of the appliance after it has been on for some time. In either case, it’s important to understand what they mean and what corrective steps you can take.

The first thing to understand is that the error codes on a Miele dishwasher usually indicate that some type of interruption, such as a power failure, occurred while the dishwasher was in operation, so checking the power is a common step when troubleshooting. Other error codes may be related to specific parts of your dishwasher, such as the pump or the heating element.

It’s also important to note that Miele dishwasher error codes can vary depending on the type of dishwasher you have, as well as the type of diagnostic software being used to read the codes. To ensure you’re troubleshooting the problem correctly, make sure you’re looking at the appropriate error codes for your model and version of the software/firmware.
