Air purifiers are a great way to keep your home air clean and free of pollutants. But if you don’t want to invest in an air purifier, there are other alternatives that can help reduce the amount of contaminants in your home. Here are a few ways to improve the air quality in your home without an air purifier. 

1. Reduce Pollution Sources: One of the most important steps you can take is to reduce the sources of pollutants coming into your home. This means avoiding smoking indoors, using low-VOC paints and cleaning products, investing in a good vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter, and properly ventilating the house with fresh air when possible. 

2. Use Houseplants: Houseplants are not only beautiful additions to any space but they also have natural filtration properties that can help remove toxins from indoor air. Studies have found that certain plants like ferns, spider plants, and palms can absorb formaldehyde and other VOCs from paint fumes or cleaning products and improve overall indoor air quality. 

3. Monitor Humidity Levels: High levels of humidity can create an ideal environment for dust mites, mold spores, and other harmful particles that contaminate indoor air quality. A hygrometer or humidity monitor can help you keep track of relative humidity levels in your home so you know when it’s necessary to take corrective measures such as using a dehumidifier or increasing ventilation within the house. 

4. Upgrade Your HVAC System: If you have an older HVAC system it may be time for an upgrade as old systems don’t typically include filters designed specifically for trapping small particles like dust mites or pet dander that can contaminate indoor air quality over time if left unchecked. Investing in a new HVAC system with improved filtration capabilities will help ensure cleaner indoor air all year round without having to purchase an additional appliance like an air purifier. 

These simple alternative methods won’t completely replace an effective whole-home filtration system but they will definitely help reduce allergens and contaminants present in your home while improving overall indoor environmental health without breaking the bank!
