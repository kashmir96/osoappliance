Stove Top Stuffing is a popular stuffing mix that is used to make stuffing for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other special occasions. The stuffing mix was first introduced by the General Foods Corporation in 1972. It was created by a team of food scientists who wanted to make a quick and easy stuffing that could be made on the stove top. 

Today, Stove Top Stuffing is manufactured by Kraft Heinz Company, which acquired General Foods Corporation in 1995. The stuffing mix comes in several flavors including Chicken, Turkey, Cornbread, and Savory Herbs & Onion. Each package contains flavored bread crumbs and seasoning that can be combined with butter or margarine and water to create a delicious stuffing that can be cooked on the stove top or oven. 

Stove Top Stuffing has become a staple of many holiday meals due to its convenience and great taste. It is also used as an ingredient in many recipes such as casseroles and meatloaves. Whether youâ€™re looking for an easy way to make your favorite holiday dish or just want something quick and tasty for dinner, Stove Top Stuffing is sure to please!
