## Prevent Dishwasher Malfunctions with Careful Use 
Most households have a dishwasher that is used every day. Though dishwashers are easy to use and efficient, common mistakes can shorten its life span and even cause it to malfunction. To get the most from your dishwasher and to keep it running smoothly, take some precautions with your usage.

### Be Mindful of Loading 
It’s important to properly load your dishwasher so it can perform its best. Make sure items are placed correctly, leaving plenty of space for water and detergent to reach all surfaces. Only use recommended detergents and follow any fill line instructions. Don’t overload your dishwasher and stick to the recommended capacity.

### Monitor Materials 
Some materials don’t play well with dishwashers. It’s important to monitor what items are used in your dishwasher and to restrict materials that are not dishwasher safe. This includes plastic items, wood and ceramics. Consider handwashing a few items, such as dishes that are fragile or have intricate designs that could be damaged.

### Watch Water Temperature 
The ideal water temperature for most dishwashers ranges between 120 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature is too low, the dishes may come out dirty, and a temperature that is too high may damage some of your dishes. Be sure to use hot water for the most effective cleaning.

By taking precautions in how you use your dishwasher, you can help lengthen its life span and ensure it keeps performing efficiently. If you experience any appliance malfunctions, don’t hesitate to consult a certified appliance repair technician from our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). With their help, you can get your dishwasher back in tip-top shape.

## Common Faults of Dishwasher Usage

Q1: What are the most common faults with dishwasher usage? 
A1: The most common faults with dishwasher usage include using too much detergent, overloading the dishwasher, blocking the rotating arms, not running the hot water before starting the cycle, and using the wrong cycle for certain items.

Q2: What kind of detergent should I use in the dishwasher? 
A2: You should use a specially-formulated detergent designed for dishwasher use. Avoid using too much detergent, as it can form excess suds that cause drainage issues.

Q3: How do I ensure that dishes are properly placed in the dishwasher? 
A3: Make sure dishes aren't blocking the rotating arms and that they're correctly organized in the machine. Plates should be placed facing downwards, and saucers, shallow bowls, and mugs should be kept on the upper rack.

Q4: How often should I clean the filters in my dishwasher? 
A4: Most dishwashers require the filter to be cleaned once a month or so. This will help ensure it operates efficiently and prevents the buildup of food particles that can cause damage. 

Q5: Should I pre-rinse dishes before placing them in the dishwasher? 
A5: It is not essential to pre-rinse dishes before placing them in the dishwasher, but it may help to prevent food particles from becoming lodged in the filters and causing more damage.
