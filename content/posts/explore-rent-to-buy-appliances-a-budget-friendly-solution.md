## Get Appliances Now, Pay Later with a Rent-to-Buy Offer
If you're in the marketplace for new household appliances but don't have the budget for an outright purchase, rent-to-buy programs provide a great option. There are a variety of companies offering rent-to-buy selections that can have you set up with a kitchen, laundry, or other appliances within days. 

Rent-to-buy programs generally require no credit check and are incredibly affordable. Rather than shelling out hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars up-front, you can make low weekly payments with flexible terms that make it easier than ever to bring home the appliances you need. Additionally, many rent-to-buy offers provide free delivery and setup as part of their services. 

These rent-to-buy programs provide a wide range of options, from popular brands to energy-efficient models, so you can find the perfect appliance for your home. Additionally, some companies are now offering “future purchases” that allows you to set aside money from your weekly payments to put towards the purchase of a product down the line. 

For those looking for a quick and easy solution for their household appliance needs, a rent-to-buy deal can provide a great and budget-friendly option. Plus, with no annoying credit checks, approvement is a breeze. Check out our [List of Appliance Rental Companies](./pages/appliance-rental) now to find an offer that works best for you!
