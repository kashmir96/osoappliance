# Washing machine making banging sound

If your washing machine is making a banging noise when the drum spins, it can be very disruptive and annoying. Fortunately, this problem is usually easy to fix. In this blog post we will discuss some of the common causes of a washing machine making a banging sound, and how to address it. 

The most common cause of a noisy washing machine is if an object has become lodged in the drum. Objects such as coins, buttons, nails and screws can all end up in the wash cycle. It’s important to check that nothing has been left in pockets before loading your clothes into the machine. If you do find something lodged in there, unplug the washer before attempting to remove it manually. 

Another common cause of loud banging noises coming from your washing machine is an off-balance load of laundry. Overloading your washer or having too few items can throw off the balance while it’s spinning and create loud bangs as it tries to re-correct itself mid-cycle. To prevent this from happening, always make sure you’re loading a balanced load into your washer so that it doesn’t have to work harder than necessary during its cycle. You should also consider investing in shock absorbers for extra protection against noisy cycles caused by an off-balance load; these are inexpensive and easy to install accessories which work by absorbing vibrations during spin cycles for quieter operation. 

Sometimes loud noises coming from a washing machine are caused by worn out or damaged parts inside the appliance itself - such as components on its motor or drive shafts being worn out or broken – which can lead to excessive vibration while running through cycles at higher speeds. If you suspect this may be causing the noise coming from your washer, contact an experienced technician to take a look inside and replace any damaged parts as soon as possible; not only will this stop any further damage but also eliminate unnecessary noise throughout its cycles too! 

Finally, keep in mind that sometimes excess wear due age on older machines may be enough cause extra noise during cycles - so if all else fails consider investing in a new model (or doing more frequent maintenance) so that you don't have endure those loud bangs anymore!
