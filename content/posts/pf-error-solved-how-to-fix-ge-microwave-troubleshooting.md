## Fixing GE Microwave Troubleshooting Errors
Getting an error code on your General Electric Microwave can be a source of irritation. Luckily, many of the codes can be solved quickly and easily using a few tips and tricks. This article will help you understand how to troubleshoot and fix error codes on your GE microwave, and get you back to cooking your favorite meals in no time.

One of the most common GE microwave errors is related to the PF Error code. The PF code typically appears on the microwave’s display when you press the start button. It stands for "power failure" and indicates the microwave has been disconnected from the power supply. This can be caused by a tripped circuit breaker or a blown fuse in your home’s electrical system. Before you start to troubleshoot the error, make sure you reset the circuit breaker, or replace the fuse in the circuit box.

If the PF code still appears on the display after resetting the circuit, you may need to replace certain components in the microwave, such as the door latch switch. This switch controls the microwave’s operation and will prevent it from starting without a proper connection. If the door latch switch is broken, it needs to be replaced, as it can be potentially dangerous if allowed to operate with a faulty connection. You may also need to unplug the unit and check all the wires and connections to ensure there are no loose connections or wires that need to be replaced.

Once the door latch switch is replaced and the wires and connections are checked, the microwave should start working again. If the PF code appears again, it could be due to a faulty connection, or a more serious issue with the microwave. It is best to get an appliance repair technician to look at it to ensure the problem is resolved and that the microwave is safe for use.

Learning how to troubleshoot and fix GE microwave errors can help you resolve common issues quickly and without the need for an appliance repair technician. Knowing how to fix a power failure code can help you get back to using your microwave properly.
