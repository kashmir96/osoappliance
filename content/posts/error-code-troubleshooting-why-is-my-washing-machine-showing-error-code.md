## Troubleshooting an Error Message on My Washer

It can be frustrating when your washing machine is displaying an error code. If this is your first time dealing with this issue, don’t panic! You can troubleshoot the error code and figure out what is wrong with your washing machine. 

The first step you want to take when dealing with these error codes is to try and reset the washing machine. You can reset most washing machines by pressing and holding the power button for 5-10 seconds. If that does not reset the washing machine, you will need to check the error code with the owner’s manual. This manual should have a list of common codes, and their meaning. 

Once you have identified the code, you can use the owners manual to determine what is wrong with your washing machine. Many codes are issued for common problems such as clogged filters, damaged bolts, hoses, or other small problems. If the manual does not give a diagnosis, you may need to contact an appliance professional to help you out. 

If you have identified the problem, you can repair it yourself if you feel confident. You can look up the part that needs to be replaced, and purchase it online or at your local hardware store. If you are still not sure, you can contact the manufacturer and they may be able to advise you on the necessary repairs. 

Troubleshooting an error code on your washing machine can be done fairly easily. When in doubt, you can use the owners manual to identify the code. If the manual does not help, you can also contact the manufacturer or an appliance professional to help you out. If you are familiar with repairing electronics, you can also try to repair the problem yourself.
