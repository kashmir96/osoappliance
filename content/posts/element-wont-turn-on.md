# Stove element wont turn on

If you own an electric stove and find that one of the elements won't turn on, it can be a source of frustration. Fortunately, there is often a simple explanation for why this happens. In this blog post, we will discuss some common reasons why an electric stove element may not turn on and provide tips for how to resolve the issue.

The first thing to check is whether the element is receiving power. If the kitchen circuit breaker has been tripped or if a fuse has blown then this could be what is preventing the element from turning on. In these cases, resetting or replacing the circuit breaker or fuse should solve the problem.

If power appears to be reaching your appliance but still nothing happens when you try to turn it on then there may be something wrong with either its wiring or its internal components such as switches, heating coils or thermostats which are not allowing current flow through them properly and thus preventing it from functioning correctly. You may also have an issue with your thermal switch which senses temperature variations in order for certain features of your appliance like preheating ovens and keeping food warm work properly; if this switch fails then you will likely experience problems with your elements turning on correctly as well as other issues such as inaccurate temperatures within your oven cavity itself . 

In order to determine what exactly is causing a faulty element connection in these cases requires inspection by a qualified technician who can accurately diagnose any underlying issues before attempting any repairs themselves (it’s always best practice when dealing with electricity).  If necessary they can also replace faulty parts so that everything works exactly how it should again–they'll even do maintenance checks too!  Just remember that safety precautions must always come first when dealing with electrical appliances like stoves so make sure not handle anything unless professional help gets involved - they know their stuff after all!
