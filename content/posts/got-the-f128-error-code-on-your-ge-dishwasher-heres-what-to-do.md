## Don't Panic if You Get the F128 Error Code on Your GE Dishwasher
If you recently purchased a new GE dishwasher, you may have recently been met with a confusing and scary error message – the F128 error code. No need to panic – this error code simply means that your dishwasher isn’t working as it should, and it can be resolved with simple solutions.

The F128 error code is an indication that the dishwasher’s motor isn’t running as it should. This code may show up when you’re trying to run a cycle, and it’s generally an indication that the dishwasher cannot complete the cycle it is attempting because of the issue with the motor. This doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s something wrong with the motor itself, however.

The first thing you should do when you encounter this error code is to check another appliance in the home that runs on electricity. If the other appliance isn’t working either, you may have a power interruption problem in the home that needs to be addressed. You’ll also want to reset the dishwasher and try the cycle again, to see if that takes care of the issue.

If a power outage or reset doesn’t address the issue, then check to make sure any connections and wiring to the dishwasher are secure, as this could be causing the motor to not be able to properly run. If none of these solutions take care of the problem, then it’s likely time to bring in a professional. A professional appliance repair technician will have the experience and expertise to be able to fix the problem with the dishwasher, or replace the faulty parts if necessary.

Don't let the F128 error code cause you to panic. Most of the time, this error can be resolved with a simple reset or power outage solution. However, if all else fails and the problem still persists it is important to call a professional appliance repair technician to help you. If you're looking for a repairman or appliance technician in or near your area, you can find one on our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
