An air purifier is a device that helps to remove dust, pollen, pet dander and other airborne particles from the air in your home or office. It does this by filtering the air through a filter which traps and removes the particles. The most common type of air purifiers use a HEPA filter to capture these particles, allowing for cleaner and fresher-smelling indoor air.

Air purifiers can be helpful when it comes to reducing dust in your home or office. Dust is made up of small particles of dirt and other materials that can settle on surfaces, such as furniture and floors. These particles can cause allergic reactions in some people, leading to sneezing, coughing, watery eyes and other uncomfortable symptoms. By trapping dust particles in its filter, an air purifier helps reduce these symptoms by cleaning the air you breathe indoors. 

In addition to improving air quality indoors, an air purifier with a HEPA filter also helps remove odors from the room due to its ability to trap small particle pollutants such as smoke or pet dander. This way you can enjoy fresh-smelling and clean indoor air even when you have pets at home or when someone smokes inside your house or office space. 

Overall, an air purifier with a HEPA filter is an effective tool for removing dust from the environment inside your house or office space. It not only reduces allergens but also improves indoor air quality by trapping smaller particle pollutants like smoke or pet dander so you can enjoy clean and fresh-smelling indoor atmosphere all year round!
