## The Cost of Commercial Dishwashers: What You Should Know

A commercial dishwasher is a specialised piece of equipment that is essential for any business that requires the clean and efficient washing of dishes or other kitchen items. However, this comes at a cost. Many factors need to be taken into consideration when determining the cost of purchasing a commercial dishwasher, including size, efficiency, and installation costs. In this blog, we will discuss what you should know about the high cost of a commercial dishwasher.

The size of a commercial dishwasher is the key factor in determining its purchase price, and larger machines will naturally cost more. In some cases, the size of the dishwasher can be determined by the amount of space available. Smaller, countertop dishwashers are often more economical and suited to smaller restaurants, while larger dishwashers are necessary for large-scale operations. 

Additionally, the amount of dishes a dishwasher can handle during a cycle impacts the cost. Highly efficient, sophisticated machines can handle a high volume of dishes, but the cost for such equipment is typically high. This can be beneficial for businesses at a certain scale, as the time and money saved by these specialised dishwashers can be substantial.

The installation requirements of a commercial dishwasher can be a significant factor in the total cost. Hiring a plumber or contractor to install a dishwasher can be costly, particularly if any additional piping or equipment is required. Depending on the dishwasher, it may be possible to install it yourself, saving on labour costs.

Finally, the energy efficiency rating of the dishwasher will affect the cost. High-efficiency models require less energy and water than traditional models, so the cost for these can be higher initially, but will be more economical in the long run.

In conclusion, purchasing a commercial dishwasher can be costly, due to the size, efficiency, and installation costs. However, the savings in time, energy, and money that the highly efficient models provide can be worthwhile for businesses that require larger volumes of dishes to be cleaned regularly.
