Have you ever wanted to draw a washing machine? Drawing a washing machine is not as complicated as it may seem. With just a few simple steps, you can create a realistic and detailed drawing of your very own.

Let’s get started! To begin, draw two rectangles on the page. One should be slightly smaller than the other and they should be placed side by side with equal space in between them. These will be the sides of your washing machine.

Next, draw curved lines at the top and bottom of each rectangle for the lid and base respectively. Then draw short lines connecting the two rectangles to form four edges around each of them. Now we have the basic shape of our washing machine drawn out!

Now let’s add some details to make it look more realistic. Draw four small circles on each corner of both rectangles – these will become our knobs or buttons for controlling your appliance. Also add a handle at the top edge of one side for lifting up the lid easily when needed. 

Finally, add some detailing around your drawing such as lines and shapes that signify metal parts or seams along with shading to give it texture and depth if desired. And there you have it – a simple yet detailed drawing of a washing machine!
