When it comes to styling our hair, a hair dryer is essential. It helps us create the perfect look in a short amount of time and with minimal effort. But with so many different types of hair dryers on the market, it can be difficult to know exactly how much you should be paying for one. 

The cost of a hair dryer depends on several factors such as its size, wattage, features, and brand. A basic model that is simply designed to blow hot air will usually cost around $20-$50 depending on the size and wattage. However, if you are looking for something more powerful or feature-rich like ceramic or tourmaline technology , then you may need to spend more money in order to get the best quality product. On average, mid-range models cost between $50-$100 while high-end models can range from $100 up to $200 or more. 

When shopping for a new hair dryer, it's important to remember that sometimes spending more money will get you better results in terms of speed and styling power. But considering that most people only use their hairdryers a few times per week (if not less), investing too much into an expensive model may not be necessary unless you are looking for professional results every single time. Ultimately, the amount you should spend on a hairdryer really depends on your budget and your needs; just make sure whatever option you choose is suitable for your budget as well as your desired style!
