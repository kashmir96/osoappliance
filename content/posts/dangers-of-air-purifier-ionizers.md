We’ve all heard of air purifiers and the many benefits they can provide us with in regards to improving our indoor air quality. However, not all air purifiers are created equal, and one type of air purifier that has been known to cause more harm than good is an ionizer. 

An ionizer is typically a type of air purifier that works by releasing negatively charged ions into the atmosphere in order to neutralize airborne particles such as dust, pollen, pet dander and smoke. While this sounds like it should be beneficial for our health, the reality is that these negatively charged ions can actually create unhealthy levels of ozone in your home or office environment. 

Ozone is a gas composed of three oxygen atoms (O3) and has been linked to numerous health problems such as respiratory irritation, headaches, dizziness and chest pain. Ozone can also react with other chemicals present in the atmosphere which may lead to additional health risks such as asthma attacks or even heart disease over time. 

In some cases, ionizers have been known to generate ozone levels higher than what’s recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). So while they may seem like an attractive option for improving your indoor air quality – they could actually be causing more harm than good! Therefore it’s important to research any product you are considering using before making a purchase decision – especially when it comes to something like an ionizer which could have serious long-term implications on your health if used incorrectly!
