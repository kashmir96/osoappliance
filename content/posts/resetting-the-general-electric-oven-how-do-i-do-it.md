## Resetting Your General Electric Oven in Easy Steps
Using a General Electric oven is an enjoyable cooking experience. But when your oven isn't performing the way it should—or if you just want to reset settings—there are steps to take for success. Read on for details about how to reset your GE oven. 

To reset your oven, the first step is to make sure the unit is plugged in, the oven door is closed, and the surface strength smart control panel is illuminated. There are several variations in GE oven models, so you may need to consult your owner's manual to find the exact setting. 

Next, you'll need to locate the reset button. It is typically located on the back of the range, above the oven door. If it's is not present, you may need to locate the main breaker at the main electric panel, turn off the unit and then turn it back on.

The reset button is a small, circular button. On some models, it is labeled "Reset"—on others, the marking may simply be blank. Once located, push and hold the reset button for approximately 10 seconds. This will reset the oven's temperature settings back to the factory defaults. 

If your oven does not have a reset button, you will need to unplug it for about two minutes. Upon re-plugging the unit, you should hear a series of "chirps"—these are letting you know the unit has been reset. 

Resetting a General Electric oven is a straightforward process that can be completed easily in a few simple steps. If you require greater assistance with this task, never hesitate to call a professional appliance service technician.

To ensure that you get the most out of your General Electric oven, take time periodically to reset the settings. With just a few minutes of effort, your oven can be functioning like brand-new.
