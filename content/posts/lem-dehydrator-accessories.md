A Lem dehydrator is a great tool for preserving and storing food, but to make sure that you get the best performance out of your dehydrator, it’s important to choose the right accessories. 

The first accessory you should consider is a timer. A timer will allow you to accurately control the drying process and help ensure food doesn’t overcook or burn. It’s also useful if you want to set a specific length of time for the food to dry, so it doesn’t stay in the dehydrator too long and lose its flavor or texture. 

Another useful accessory is a variety of trays, shelves, and liners. These accessories can help keep your dehydrated foods organized and can also be used to prevent sticking or cross contamination between foods. The non-stick liners are especially helpful when making jerky as they are designed not to stick together as they dry. 

If you plan on making fruit leathers or other sticky items like yogurt, then trays with raised edges can be beneficial as well since they will help keep the fruits from spilling over during the drying process. 

Finally, one last essential Lem Dehydrator accessory is an air filter which will help reduce dust from entering your machine and settling onto your food while drying. This helps ensure that all of your dehydrated foods remain clean and safe for consumption. 

To summarize, having the right Lem Dehydrator accessories can make a big difference in how well your machine runs and how much quality food you are able to produce with it! They include timers, trays, shelves liners, raised edge trays for sticky items like fruit leathers or yogurt, as well as air filters to keep dust away from your machine and food while drying!
