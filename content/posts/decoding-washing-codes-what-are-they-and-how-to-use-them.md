## Unravelling Washing Codes: What Do They Mean and How to Use Them

One of the most important parts of doing laundry is to make sure that you get it right! Whether you’re tackling everyday loads or those more delicate items, understanding the wash codes is vital. These codes form an essential part of the cleaning process. Coming in all shapes and sizes, understanding each of them requires a bit of effort. So, let's start decoding washing codes! 

The first thing you need to understand when it comes to washing codes is that they provide specific instructions regarding temperature, agitation, drying temperature and time. For example, a ‘warm’ setting on the washing machine may depend on the manufacturer, so a C should be used to signify warm in one brand of washing machine, while an L may be used in another. 

Some complex washing codes include specific instructions for bleaching, line drying, and even ironing. By understanding what these symbols mean, you can ensure that you get the best results from your washing. For example, a dry-cleaning code will require you to take your clothes to a dry cleaner, while a hand-wash code requires you to hand-wash the garment. 

Another important set of washing codes pertain to the fabric. Before you begin washing, understanding the properties of the fabric is essential. A W on the washing label indicates that the fabric is washable, an X means that it is dry clean only and an S stands for a specialised cleaning process. Along with this, numbers also provide information: a one indicates a gentle cycle, 2 signifies a normal cycle and 3 means a heavy-duty cycle.

Following washing codes helps you to make sure that your garments are washed properly and taken care of. Understanding the right wash cycle and setting is the key! With a little bit of knowledge and practice, you should be able to decode washing codes with ease. 

With the right guidance and knowledge, a better understanding of washing codes can help you clean your clothes in the best way possible. If you're looking to stock your home with top-performing appliances, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
