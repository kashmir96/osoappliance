Small appliances are small, portable devices that are used for a variety of purposes. They can be used to complete everyday tasks such as cleaning, preparing food, and making drinks. Examples of small appliances include blenders, coffee makers, electric kettles, vacuum cleaners, irons and immersion blenders.

Blenders are an incredibly useful appliance for preparing all sorts of food and drinks. They can be used to make smoothies, soups and sauces. For smoothies, you simply add the ingredients into the blender’s container and turn it on to create a delicious drink in minutes!

Coffee makers are also a great way to start your day with a hot cup of coffee. With an automatic machine you don’t even have to measure out the coffee or wait for it to brew - just pour in the water and press start! 

Electric kettles are a great way to quickly boil water without having to use the stovetop or microwave. They come in all different sizes so you can find one that fits your needs perfectly - from large ones that can make enough hot water for several people at once to small ones that only hold one cup at a time. 

Vacuum cleaners help keep your home free from dust and dirt by sucking up particles from carpets and hard surfaces alike. Upright vacuums are best for larger spaces such as open floor plans while handheld models work better for smaller areas like closets or stairs. 

Irons make it easy to quickly press clothes so they look crisp and fresh every time you wear them! Just plug in the ironing board wherever is convenient (such as next to an outlet) then plug in the iron itself before turning it on. From there you just need some fabric spray starch or water if needed before running the flat iron over your clothing item until all wrinkles have been removed! 

Immersion blenders are perfect if you want something that’s quick but also powerful enough for tough jobs like blending soups or making purees out of cooked vegetables without making too much noise or taking up too much space on your countertop. This appliance is especially handy when chopping onions since it doesn’t release any fumes into your kitchen air like traditional choppers do!
