## Spruce Up Your Home with Heat Pump Attachments 
Keeping your home comfortable with a heat pump is necessary in almost all climates– but why not add some accessories to give your home an updated look? Installing additional heat pump accessories gives you an opportunity to make your interior design unique and to ensure your unit continues to work well for years to come. 

As you plan for the installation of new heating and cooling elements in your home, look for accessories that will help the unit run more efficiently. One great way to boost efficiency is by adding a control panel, which can automate the on-and-off switch of the unit depending on the temperature of the home. Additionally, thermostat optimization helps your heat pump use minimal energy while maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the home. 

If your heat pump is placed in an area that can be seen from outside, you may want to think about style and aesthetics of your unit. Attachments like weatherproof covers and air diffusers are an easy way to upgrade the exterior look and make sure your heat pump is protected from the elements. Your air diffuser should be able to compliment the décor of your home and replace any visible components that require access to the heat pump. 

After selecting an accessory for your unit, you’ll want to consider maintenance and cleaning. An easy way to keep your unit in peak performance is by frequently changing the filter and keeping the fan blades clean. Doing this on a regular basis helps minimize the work of the heat pump and ensures it is running correctly. 

No matter if you’re outfitting a brand new unit or you’re performing routine maintenance on an old one, heat pump accessories make it easy to personalize the look and maintain the peak performance of your system. Taking the time to accessorize your heat pump will keep your home looking modern while keeping you toasty on cold winter nights.

- What are the benefits of using a high-efficiency filter system?
 - High-efficiency filter systems can improve your home's air quality and help to reduce symptoms related to allergies and asthma. The filters can also help to prolong the life of your heat pump by reducing strain placed on the system caused by dirt and dust. 

- How does a UVC germicidal lamp help to improve my home's air quality?
