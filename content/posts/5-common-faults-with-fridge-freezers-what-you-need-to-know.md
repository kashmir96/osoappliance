## Identifying the 5 Most Common Refrigerator and Freezer Faults 
If you are a homeowner, it is important to be aware of the five common refrigerator and freezer faults that could occur. Knowing what to look out for and being able to quickly identify the source of the problem can be essential in getting the appliance back up and running.

### Fault One: Cooling Problems 
When a refrigerator or freezer isn't cooling properly, the most common cause is a problem with the condenser coils being clogged with dust and debris. If the coils are dirty, they will have a harder time releasing heat and the appliance won't be able to cool properly. Cleaning the coils is usually an easy fix and the coil brush can be purchased from many appliance stores.

### Fault Two: Water and Ice Problems 
If you notice water or ice accumulating around the back of the refrigerator, it's likely due to a blocked defrost drain. Since the defrost drain is responsible for transporting moisture away from the appliance, a blockage will cause it to back up and eventually leak. To resolve the issue, the drain should be cleared of any debris. 

### Fault Three: Excessive Noise 
It is normal for a refrigerator or freezer to make some noise, however, excessive noise can be an indication of a deeper problem. The cause could be an overfilled refrigerator, a defective compressor motor, or a failing condenser fan motor. If the sound persists, it is best to have an appliance technician take a look and diagnose the source of the noise. 

### Fault Four: Temperature Problems 
The thermostat is typically the culprit when it comes to temperature issues. The thermostat could be failing or it is not adjusted to the right setting. It should be checked to ensure it is set to the desired temperature. If it appears to be working, the issue is more likely to be a problem with the evaporator or condenser fan motor. 

### Fault Five: Freezer Frost or Ice Buildup 
If too much frost or ice is building up in the freezer compartment, it is likely due to too much humidity in the room. Excess humidity causes the refrigerator to work harder and can lead to an excessive buildup of frost or ice in the freezer. To avoid this problem, ensure the room temperature is consistent and the refrigerator is located in a well-ventilated area. 

The five common faults with refrigerator and freezers listed above are some of the most likely causes of a malfunctioning appliance. It is best to check the appliance routinely and look out for any of the above signs. If any of the symptoms persist, call a reliable appliance repair technician to help you resolve the issue.

## Common Fridge Freezer Faults

### 1. What causes food in the freezer to become frosty or icy?
This is often caused by warm air entering the freezer due to a faulty door seal or mis-aligned door hinges. As the warm air enters, the water molecules in the freezer food evaporate, leaving behind frost and ice.

### 2. What causes excessive noise from a fridge freezer?
This may be caused by various components such as the fan motor, condenser coils or compressor. If these components become blocked with dust or loose debris, then they can start to make more noise than usual. It’s best to call a professional to have them checked and fixed.

### 3. What do I need to check when my fridge freezer is not cooling?
The first thing to do is check the temperature setting to see if it needs to be adjusted. Also, make sure the door is closing properly and the seals are in good condition. You may also want to check for any blockages in the condenser coils on the back of the fridge and the temperature of the compressor. 

### 4. What causes a fridge freezer to smell?
This is often caused by food spoilage, meaning food has gone bad inside the fridge or freezer. It is important to check out the contents of the fridge and discard any food that has gone bad. Additionally, you may want to clean the interior of the fridge and freezer to remove any bad odour.

### 5. What steps need to be taken when a fridge freezer stops working?
First, check the power source to make sure the appliance is plugged in properly. If the appliance is plugged in, then check the circuit breaker to make sure it’s not tripped. If it is tripped, reset it and try running the appliance again. If the problem persists, then it’s best to call a professional repair service.
