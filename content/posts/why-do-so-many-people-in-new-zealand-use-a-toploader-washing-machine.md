When it comes to washing machines, New Zealanders have a clear preference: the Toploader. This iconic appliance has been a staple in Kiwi households for decades. So why is it so popular?

The answer lies in the country’s norms and local manufacturers. New Zealanders have long favoured the Toploader for its convenience and affordability. It’s easy to use, requires minimal effort to operate and is relatively inexpensive. Plus, it’s been manufactured in New Zealand for many years, by the country's most trusted washing machine brand, Fisher and Paykel. 

The Toploader also has a number of advantages over front-loading washing machines. It’s much easier to load and unload, and it doesn’t require a lot of bending or stooping. The Toploader also uses less water than a front-loader, making it more energy-efficient.

The Toploader has become so popular in New Zealand that it’s become something of a cultural icon. It’s been featured in television shows, movies and even advertisements. This has helped to cement its status as the go-to washing machine for Kiwis.

So, if you’re looking for a reliable and affordable washing machine, the Toploader is the way to go. It’s been a staple in New Zealand homes for generations and it’s sure to continue to be a popular choice for years to come.
