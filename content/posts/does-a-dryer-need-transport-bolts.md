The short answer is no, a dryer does not need transport bolts. Transport bolts are only used on washing machines and not dryers because the two appliances have different designs that require different installation methods.

Transport bolts are used on washing machines to secure the internal components of the machine during transportation. The bolts are tightened to the sides of the machine to prevent the drum from shifting or moving around. This prevents damage to the internal components of the machine and ensures that the machine is stable during transport.

Dryers, on the other hand, do not need transport bolts because their design does not require them. Dryers are typically much lighter than washing machines, so they do not require the same level of stabilization during transport. Additionally, dryers are designed to be installed in a stationary position, so they do not need to be secured in the same way that a washing machine does.

In conclusion, transport bolts are only used on washing machines and not dryers because the two appliances have different designs that require different installation methods. Dryers do not need transport bolts because they are much lighter than washing machines and are designed to be installed in a stationary position.
