## Is Your Heating System Showing Fault Codes?

When temperatures start to drop and you are relying on your furnace to keep your home warm and cozy, the last thing you want to hear is an annoying 'beep'. This is usually a sign of your furnace communication with you to tell you there's an issue. Fault codes from your furnace indicate that it may need repair.

Furnace fault codes are displayed when an error or warning is detected. They are generated by a furnace’s electronic control board and appear as error codes displayed on the furnace's control panel. Each code identifies a particular component or problem that requires attention.

Knowing exactly what the codes mean is important in order to take the right steps in repairing the furnace. Being able to correctly diagnose the fault code is key in ensuring that the right part is ordered and working correctly the first time. If you are unsure of what the code means, you may want to contact a repair technician to come and help.

It is possible to do a Google search online to determine what the code means. However, bear in mind that different furnaces from different brands often use the same code for different component failures. It is essential to check the exact furnace make and model for the correct fault code.

It is also important to be aware that different types of codes require different types of repairs. Replaceable modules and simple wiring corrections no longer require a technician's expertise and you may be able to do the repair on your own. Some fault codes require more technical expertise and will require the assistance of a qualified appliance repair technician.

If after assessing the fault code, it appears that the repair is something you can’t tackle on your own, it is time to start looking for an appliance technician. A technician with the right experience and expertise will be able to accurately diagnose and repair the furnace on the first visit. To help you find an experienced and reliable technician, be sure to check out our Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians.
