## From Cramming to Clever Organization of Whiteware
Do you ever find yourself at a loss as to how to store household appliances? A lack of cupboard and bench space in your home can make it hard to store items neatly and efficiently. Here are some top tips on how to store whiteware without having to cram your home full of appliances.

The first thing to consider when storing whiteware is how often you use it. Storing appliances you rarely use out of sight will help you to maximize the available storage space. For those that are used often, the best option is often to store them at the top or front of the cupboard, making them easy to access.

When deciding where to place your whiteware, try to think in terms of zones. For example, place all your kitchen appliances together, such as your oven and stove, to create an efficient, easy-to-access area. If you occasionally need items from different zones, it can save time to place them closer together.

You may also want to consider investing in drawer organizers, boxes or shelves that can be used to maximize the space in your cupboards. Doing so will make it easier for you to find the items you need, and can also help to make the best use of your available space.

The key to successful storing of whiteware is to create an organized and efficient storage space. If you can stay organized, it will make it easier to keep your home looking neat, while also making it more convenient to locate items when needed. 

Organizing your household appliances can be challenging, but with a little patience and thoughtfulness you can optimize your storage space and create a neat and efficient environment.
