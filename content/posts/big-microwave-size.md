If you’re on the hunt for a new microwave, one of the first questions you’ll need to consider is size. How big of a microwave do you need? Do you have enough counter space for a large model or would something smaller work better? 

Big microwaves are well suited to larger households and commercial settings. They can range from 1.6 cubic feet all the way up to 2.2 cubic feet in size, which is larger than most traditional ovens. This extra capacity means that they can easily fit large plates and dishes as well as multiple items at once; perfect for busy families or restaurants with high demand. 

The biggest advantage of owning a big microwave is that it allows you to cook multiple dishes at once without having to worry about overcrowding or having to wait longer than necessary for each dish to be cooked through properly. For example, if you wanted to cook four different items simultaneously, then this wouldn’t be possible in smaller models but could easily be achieved in larger ones. 

In addition, bigger microwaves tend to come with more features than their smaller counterparts such as additional power levels and pre-programmed settings which make it easier and faster when cooking food. Some even come with built-in sensors which automatically adjust cooking times so that your meals will always turn out perfectly every time! 

Another benefit of investing in a big microwave is that they tend to last much longer than other models due their robust construction and extra features - perfect if your kitchen sees heavy use on an everyday basis! 

Ultimately, the decision on what size microwave works best for your home should depend upon space available and how many people are likely going touse it regularly; however if there is room available then opting for something bigger may offer greater convenience in the long run!
