If you’ve ever found a mouse in your dishwasher, you know how stressful it can be. It’s a situation that no one wants to find themselves in, but it happens more often than you might think. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to get a mouse out of your dishwasher safely and effectively.

First, it’s important to identify where the mouse is located. If you can see it, you’ll want to try to corner it and then gently scoop it up with a dustpan or cup. If you can’t see it, you’ll need to do a bit of detective work. Look for signs of mouse activity, such as droppings, chewed wires, or nests. Once you’ve located the mouse, you can move on to the next step.

Next, you’ll need to create a safe environment for the mouse to escape. This can be done by placing a box or bowl in the dishwasher and propping the door open with a stick. The mouse should be able to climb out without any difficulty. If you’re worried about the mouse escaping, you can also place a towel over the bowl or box to prevent it from jumping out.

Finally, you’ll need to make sure the mouse doesn’t return. To do this, you’ll need to seal off any potential entry points. Start by inspecting the dishwasher for any cracks or holes and sealing them up with caulk or steel wool. You’ll also want to check the seals around the door and make sure there are no gaps.

Getting a mouse out of your dishwasher can be a stressful experience, but it doesn’t have to be. By following these steps, you can safely and effectively remove the mouse and make sure it doesn’t return.
