Air purifiers are essential appliances that remove contaminants from the air in our homes and offices. While they can provide a great deal of relief from allergies and other respiratory problems, there are several common problems that can occur when using air purifiers. In this blog, we will take a look at some of the more common air purifier issues and what you can do to address them.

1. Unfiltered Air: One of the most common issues with air purifiers is that they don’t properly filter out all of the pollutants in the air. This can lead to reduced effectiveness and even health problems if particles are ingested or inhaled by occupants. To ensure your air purifier is working properly, check to see if it has been recently serviced or replaced with a new filter. You may also want to consider investing in a HEPA filter for your unit to ensure maximum filtration and efficiency.

2. Clogged Filters: Over time, filters become clogged with trapped contaminants which reduces their efficiency. The best way to prevent clogging is to regularly clean or replace your filters as recommended by manufacturer guidelines or as needed depending on usage levels in your home or office environment. 

3 Fan Malfunction: If you notice any strange noises coming from your unit such as grinding, rattling, whining, etc., then it could be an indication that there is something wrong with its fan system. To fix this problem you will need to have an experienced technician inspect and repair the fan system as soon as possible so that it does not cause further damage down the road which could be costly if left unchecked for too long! 

4 Poor Performance: Your unit may not be performing up to par due to several reasons such as clogged filters, insufficient power supply (voltage), incorrect placement of units within space being cleaned etc.. It’s best practice here would be firstly reducing clutter around the area where unit has been placed - like furniture etc., secondly examining correct power supply (voltage) being used - should match exactly what’s mentioned by manufacturer & thirdly cleaning/replacing filters when required – usually after every 3 months or depending on usage levels of unit itself! 

 
All these tips should help you troubleshoot any issues related to your air purifier so that you get optimal performance out of it! If these tips don't seem effective enough then it's best advised contacting a professional technician who might prove useful in diagnosing & resolving deeper technical issues involved here!
