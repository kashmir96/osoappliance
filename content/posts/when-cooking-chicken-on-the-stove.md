Cooking chicken on the stove is one of the easiest and most convenient ways to prepare a tasty and healthy meal. Whether you’re making a simple chicken dinner or an elaborate dish, it can be done quickly and easily with just a few steps.

The first step is to heat up a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add some oil or butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is hot, add your chicken pieces (breasts, thighs, wings). Make sure that all pieces are in contact with the bottom of the pan so that they can brown evenly. Allow them to cook for about 5 minutes per side or until they’re golden brown and cooked through.

Once your chicken pieces are cooked through, remove them from the pan and set aside on a plate while you work on your sauce or sides. If you’d like to add some flavor to your chicken while cooking it, try adding some garlic powder, paprika, oregano, or other herbs and spices to give it extra flavor. If you want it even tastier, try marinating your chicken in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt & pepper for about 30 minutes before cooking it in your skillet.

When everything else is ready – vegetables cooked through and sauce finished – return your cooked chicken pieces back into the skillet with all of its juices from cooking. Allow everything to simmer together for about 5 minutes so that all of the flavors can combine together nicely before serving it up! 

Cooking chicken on the stove doesn’t have to be complicated – just use these simple steps as a guide and you’ll have an amazing meal ready in no time!
