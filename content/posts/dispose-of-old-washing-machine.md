# How to dispose of old washing machine

As you prepare to upgrade your washing machine, you may be wondering how to properly dispose of your old one. The good news is that there are several options available to you. Depending on the condition of your machine, you can recycle it, donate it, or dispose of it.

If your washing machine is in good condition, you may want to consider donating it to a thrift store, charity, or family in need. Many organizations accept used appliances and may even be able to pick them up from your home. This is a great way to get rid of your old washing machine while helping someone out at the same time.

If your washing machine is too old or damaged to donate, you may want to consider recycling it. Many appliance stores and recycling centers accept old washing machines and will either repair them or recycle the parts. This is a great way to keep your old machine out of the landfill.

Generally the metal in a washing machine has some value, so it's pretty easy to get someone to take care of this for you. Or you can get paid yourself if you live near a scrap yard.

If your washing machine is beyond repair or you canâ€™t find a place to recycle it, you may have to dispose of it. In this case, you should contact your local waste management company to see if they offer a pick-up service for large appliances. If not, you may have to rent a dumpster or hire a service to haul away your old washing machine.

By following these steps, you can easily and safely dispose of your old washing machine. Whether you donate, recycle, or dispose of it, you can rest assured that your old machine will be taken care of.
