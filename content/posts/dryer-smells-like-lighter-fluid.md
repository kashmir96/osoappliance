If your dryer smells like lighter fluid, it could be a sign of a serious problem. Lighter fluid is highly flammable and should never be used as a cleaning agent in a dryer. If you smell lighter fluid, it’s important to take action immediately to prevent a potential fire.

The most common cause of a dryer smelling like lighter fluid is a lint build-up in the dryer vent. Lint is highly flammable and when it builds up, it can ignite when exposed to heat. This is especially true if the lint is close to the heating element of the dryer. If you smell lighter fluid, it’s important to check the lint filter and clean it out.

Another potential cause of a dryer smelling like lighter fluid is a faulty gas valve if you have a gas powered dryer. If the gas valve is not working properly, it can allow gas to escape and mix with the air in the dryer. This can create a strong smell that is similar to lighter fluid. If you suspect a faulty gas valve, it’s important to call a professional for help.

Finally, it’s possible that the smell of lighter fluid is coming from the dryer fabric softener. If you use fabric softener in your dryer, it can leave behind a residue that smells like lighter fluid. To get rid of this smell, you can clean the lint filter and then run an empty cycle with a cup of white vinegar in the dryer. This will help to remove any residue that is left behind.

If your dryer smells like lighter fluid, it’s important to take action immediately. Check the lint filter, clean it out, and make sure the gas valve is functioning properly. If the smell persists, you may need to call a professional for help.
