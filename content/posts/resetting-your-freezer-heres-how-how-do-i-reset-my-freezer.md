## Reset Your Freezer the Right Way
It can be difficult to keep your freezer working its best as it deals with frequent temperature changes and different food items cooled inside. If your freezer isn't working as it should, resetting it may solve the issue. But how do you go about it? Read further to learn the step-by-step process to reset your freezer.

### Disconnect Power
The first step in resetting your freezer is to unplug it from the power source. Once you have the power disconnected, wait a few minutes for the power to completely drain from the freezer.

### Clean and Defrost
Use this opportunity to clean your freezer and defrost any buildup of frost or freezer burn. After it's completely defrosted, use a clean, damp cloth and soapy water to remove any dirt or grime that may have accumulated inside. You can also use a vacuum to reach inaccessible spots. Once your freezer is clean, it's time to reset it.

### Reset Your Freezer
After reconnecting the freezer to the power source, press and hold the “Power Freeze” or "Quick Freeze" button (depending on your model) for 8 to 10 seconds. Then press the “Power Cool” or "Fast Cool" button on the same display panel and hold it down for 8 to 10 seconds as well. This step ensures that the temperatures in your freezer are set to the factory settings.

### Set Desired Temperature
Once the factory settings are restored, press the “Power Cool” or "Fast Cool" button again and hold it down for a few seconds until the temperature displays. Now use the “Up” or “Down” arrow buttons and set your desired temperature level.

Knowing how to reset your freezer comes in handy especially when the appliance's malfunctioning due to humungous ice buildup. It is always advised to use a reliable refrigerator or freezer repair service technician if resetting doesn’t work out, or if the problem is too complex for a DIY solution.
