## Solving the 'E115' Bosch Dishwasher Error

When your Bosch dishwasher is displaying an error code E115 it means there is a water heating problem. This can leave you unsure of what to do next and worried about the cost of getting it fixed. Fortunately, it's a simple problem to diagnose and resolve so don't worry! 

First and foremost, try to restart the dishwasher by pressing the power switch all the way to off and back on again. This may be enough to clear the error code and get the dishwasher running. If this does not work, it will likely require a service call. 

The first step for a technician to diagnose the code will be to check the filter located at the bottom of the dishwasher. If it is blocked, then the machine may not be able to heat the water. If this is the case, the technician will clean or replace the filter to allow proper water flow to the heating element. 

The technician may also check the water inlet valve to ensure it is in proper working order and receiving the correct amount of water for heating. If this valve is found to be faulty, then it will need to be replaced. 

Another cause of an E115 error code could be a broken heating element. If this is the case, the technician will need to replace the broken heating element with an approved Bosch replacement. 

Once the repair is complete, the technician will perform a full test cycle to ensure that the heating system is working properly. If all goes well, then you should be good to go with a fully operational dishwasher again. 

Getting your Bosch dishwasher serviced with an E115 error code doesn't have to be a hassle. Finding a trusted and qualified technician who can identify and correct the issue quickly should help to get you back to enjoying the convenience of your dishwasher again.
