## Diagnosing and Fixing RL Error Code on a Whirlpool Duet Washer

Have you ever been doing laundry only to be greeted with an unhelpful error code? Often times these codes can tell you something helpful, but it isn't always clear. This is the case with the RL error code on a Whirlpool Duet washer. The RL error code stands for “longer than normal running time”. But what causes it and how do you fix it? In this blog post, we will go through how to diagnose and fix the problem of RL error code on a Whirlpool Duet washer. 

First, check your washer fill hoses to see if they have any kinks or clogs that could cause a back up of water or low-water level in the tub. If the hose is kinked or clogged, try to clear it or replace the hose if it’s too blocked. Second, check the drain hose for any clogs or blockages that can cause the drain to not work properly. While cleaning or replacing the hose, make sure to inspect for any blockages or restrictions in the drain pump itself. Third, inspect the washer’s filter for any lint or dirt build up which can cause the motor or the drain pump to malfunction. You can clean the filter by running it under water to flush out any debris. 

Fourth, make sure that the washer is level and in the proper position. Improper placement of the washer can cause the washer to move or lean, which can lead to errors such as the RL error code. Finally, check the water inlet valves to make sure they are functioning properly. If there’s any debris blocking the opening of the valve, then it can restrict the flow of water into the washer, thus causing an RL error code. Make sure to use a damp cloth to clean the water inlet valve openings. 

These are a few steps that can help in diagnosing and fixing the RL error code on a Whirlpool Duet washer. If the problem persists after trying all these tips, then it’s best to contact a professional for assistance.
