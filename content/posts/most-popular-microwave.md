When it comes to kitchen appliances, a microwave oven is certainly one of the most popular. Microwave ovens are convenient and can make cooking faster and easier than ever before. They also come in many different sizes and styles, so it is easy to find one that fits your needs.

A microwave oven works by using microwaves to heat food or drinks quickly and efficiently. The microwaves travel through the air at the speed of light, creating an electromagnetic field that causes molecules inside food to vibrate, producing heat energy. This makes it easier to cook food faster without losing any flavor or nutritional value.

One of the most popular types of microwave ovens is an over-the-range model, which combines a stovetop with a built-in microwave. This type of appliance saves counter space by combining two appliances into one unit, making it ideal for small kitchens with limited space for appliances. Over-the-range models also tend to be more powerful than countertop models since they require more power for their large size and additional features such as convection cooking capabilities. 

Another popular type of microwave oven is a countertop model which can range from small (0–1 cubic foot capacity) up to larger (2–3 cubic feet). These are typically less expensive than over-the-range models since they don’t have any additional features like convection cooking capabilities; however, they still offer great convenience when it comes to heating up meals in a hurry or defrosting items quickly and easily. 

Finally, there are also “smart” microwaves available on the market today which offer advanced features such as voice activation and preprogrammed recipes that make cooking even easier than ever before! These types of microwaves tend to be pricier but are perfect for those who want all the bells and whistles when it comes to their kitchen appliances.
