If you’ve been noticing a musty smell coming from your dishwasher or spotting mold on the door and other surfaces, it’s time to take action. Dishwashers are designed to keep food particles and moisture away from your dishes, but if not properly maintained, mold can grow and spread.

Mold can form in your dishwasher due to a combination of factors. First, if you’re not using your dishwasher regularly, the standing water can be a breeding ground for mold. Second, if your dishwasher is not draining properly, the moisture can create an environment where mold can thrive. Finally, if you’re not regularly cleaning the dishwasher, food particles can accumulate and become a food source for mold.

Fortunately, the steps to prevent and remove mold from your dishwasher are relatively simple. To keep your dishwasher free of mold, make sure you run it at least once a week. This will help prevent standing water from accumulating and creating a breeding ground for mold. Additionally, make sure the dishwasher is draining properly by checking the drain hose for clogs or kinks. Finally, make sure to regularly clean the interior of your dishwasher with a mild detergent and a damp cloth.

If you’ve already noticed mold in your dishwasher, there are a few steps you can take to remove it. First, remove any standing water by running the dishwasher on a full cycle. Next, mix a solution of one part bleach to 10 parts water and use a cloth or brush to scrub away the mold. Finally, rinse the interior of the dishwasher with hot water and let it dry completely before running another cycle.

By taking the proper steps to maintain your dishwasher, you can help keep mold away and ensure your dishes are clean and safe.
