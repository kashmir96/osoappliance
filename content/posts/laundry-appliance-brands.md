For those who want something more specialized than just washing machines and dryers, there’s Bosch Appliances. They specialize in high efficiency washer/dryer combos that can handle larger loads than traditional models—all while using less water! Plus their models feature intuitive controls so you can customize your laundry experience according to what works best for you. 

Finally there’s Samsung Appliances whose products have been widely praised by industry experts as being some of the best on the market when it comes to convenience features such as AddWash™ door access points (for adding clothes after beginning a cycle), built-in sensors that detect load size and type so you get optimal cleaning results every time—plus many other useful functions!
