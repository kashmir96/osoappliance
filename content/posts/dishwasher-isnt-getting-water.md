If your dishwasher isn’t getting water, it could be due to a number of issues. The first step to take is to check the water supply line to make sure it is connected and that the water is turned on. If the water supply line is connected and the water is on, then the next step is to inspect the inlet valve. The inlet valve is responsible for regulating the water flow into the dishwasher. If the valve is clogged or damaged, it will need to be replaced.

Another possible cause for a dishwasher not getting water is a clogged filter. The filter is what catches any food particles or debris that may have been left behind during the dishwashing process. If the filter is clogged, it will need to be cleaned or replaced.

Finally, if the water supply line, inlet valve, and filter are all in good working order, then the issue may be due to a faulty water pump. The water pump is responsible for pushing the water through the dishwasher. If the pump is not working, it will need to be replaced.

If your dishwasher isn’t getting water, it is important to take the necessary steps to diagnose the issue and repair it. If the problem persists, it is best to contact a professional to ensure the issue is properly resolved.
