## Understanding Reset Codes on Beko Washing Machines

Are you having trouble with a Beko washing machine? When you're experiencing an issue, it may be necessary to reset the machine. But what do you need to know about the reset code? This blog post explains the basics of resetting a Beko washing machine, including the reset code and what to do next.

Resetting your Beko washing machine can be done easily by pressing a combination of buttons. Depending on the model of washing machine, the reset sequence is usually a combination of "start/pause", "eco/temperature", and "spin/rinse". Each of these buttons needs to be pressed in the correct order in order to perform a reset. After the reset sequence is complete, it is important to enter the reset code. This code will vary depending on your particular model of washing machine, so it is important to consult your owner's manual.

Once the code is successfully entered, your washing machine will begin to reset. Generally speaking, the reset process will take up to 20 minutes to complete. During this time, the washing machine will go through a diagnostic cycle, which you can monitor on the display. This is an important step to ensure that the machine is functioning properly.

Finally, it is important to ensure that all settings are restored after the reset. To do this, it is necessary to check the machine's settings and adjust them accordingly. This is an especially important step for those using the machine's energy-saving settings.

Resetting a Beko washing machine is a relatively simple process. However, it is important to understand the basics, including the correct reset sequence and the proper code. By understanding this information, you will be better prepared to troubleshoot any issues that arise with your washing machine.
