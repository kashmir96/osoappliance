## Troubleshooting Washing Machine Error Codes 
At one point, the dreaded error code has come up on your washing machine, but now you need to figure out how to clear it. Luckily, it is a relatively easy process and you don't need to call in a technician to help. This blog will cover the steps to resolve the error code quickly and get your washer running again. 

When an error code pops up on your washing machine, the most important thing you can do is to identify what kind of code it is. This can usually be found by looking in the user manual of the washer. Once you have identified the code, you can use the information in the manual to determine the cause and the necessary steps to clear the error. 

The next step is to see what the issue is. Possible problems can range from a malfunctioning part to an incorrect setting on the washer. Simple problems such as clogged filters, a misaligned lid switch or loose electrical connections are easy to spot and fix. On the other hand, complex problems such as an issue with the washing machineâ€™s control board can be a bit more tricky and might require a technician. 

Once you have identified the problem, you can then take the appropriate steps to fix the issue. Most simple faults can be solved with basic maintenance, such as cleaning out the filters, checking the electrical connections, etc. If the problem is more complicated, you may need to call in a repairman. 

Regardless of what type of problem exists with your washer, resolving washing machine error codes can typically be done with a bit of knowledge and patience. Taking the right steps to identify and rectify the error code can save you time, hassle and money when it comes to getting your washer back up and running.
