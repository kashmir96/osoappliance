If you’re looking for a new dryer in New Zealand, the 7kg size is the most common choice. This size is perfect for households of up to four people, and it can handle a good amount of laundry in one cycle.

The 7kg dryer has a large drum capacity, so you can fit more clothes than other sizes. It also has several cycles and settings to choose from, so you can tailor it to your particular laundry needs. For example, some 7kg dryers have sensors that detect when your clothes are done drying and automatically turn off the machine, saving energy and money over time.

The 7kg dryer is also incredibly convenient because there are so many models available on the market today. You can find gas-powered dryers as well as electric ones with different features like steam drying or touch buttons for ease of use. There’s no shortage of options when it comes to finding the perfect model for your home!

When choosing a new dryer in New Zealand, consider getting a 7kg model if you have a small family or don’t need too much capacity in one cycle. With its great features and convenient size, this type of dryer will keep your clothes looking great for years to come!
