# How long should a dryer last

If you’re looking for an appliance that will provide you with years of reliable service, then a clothes dryer is likely at the top of your list. On average, a clothing dryer should last between 10 and 13 years. However, this number can vary depending on the type of dryer, frequency of use, and other factors such as proper maintenance.

First off, it's important to understand the two different types of dryers: gas and electric. Gas models tend to last longer than electric ones since they don't have as many electrical components to break down over time. Also, electric models require more energy than gas models, so they can increase your electricity bill if you're not careful when using them. With proper maintenance and regular cleaning (such as cleaning out lint traps after every load), your dryer should last up to 13 years. 

Another factor that affects your dryer's lifespan is how often it's used. If you frequently run several loads every day or week then your dryer may not last as long as one that only runs once or twice a week (or less). The amount of moisture in each load also affects the lifespan; if you're drying particularly large or wet loads then this will add extra strain on the machine and reduce its lifespan accordingly. Additionally, if you use harsh chemicals when washing clothes this can also take a toll on the longevity of your dryer. 

Finally, proper maintenance is essential for getting maximum life out of any appliance – including a clothes dryer! Make sure to periodically check all hoses for any damage or obstruction that could lead to issues down the line (like fire hazards). Additionally, be sure to clean out lint traps after every load so there isn’t any buildup inside the machine which could lead to poor air flow (and therefore decreased efficiency). 

With proper care and regular maintenance practices like these in place – combined with taking into consideration factors like usage frequency – an average clothes dryer should last up to 13 years!
