Air conditioning is a great way to keep cool during the hot summer months, but it’s important to be aware of its potential negative effects on your health. While air conditioning can provide relief from the heat, it can also cause a variety of health issues. Here are some reasons why aircon is not good for your health:

1. Poor air quality: Air conditioners typically recirculate the same air over and over again, which can lead to an accumulation of dust and dirt particles in the air that you breathe. This can worsen allergies and asthma symptoms, as well as increase your risk of developing other respiratory illnesses. Additionally, some older units may not have adequate filtration systems that help remove harmful pollutants from the air.

2. Dryness: Air conditioners tend to reduce humidity levels in indoor spaces, which can lead to dry skin and eyes, as well as increased discomfort due to static electricity buildup in fabrics like clothing or furniture upholstery. Low humidity levels also make it easier for airborne viruses and bacteria to spread more quickly within an enclosed space.

3. Stress: Prolonged exposure to cold temperatures generated by air conditioners can cause stress on the body’s cardiovascular system by forcing it to work harder than normal in order to maintain a comfortable temperature range. Additionally, loud noises produced by some AC units may contribute to stress-related problems like headaches or increased anxiety levels. 

Overall, while air conditioning provides much-needed relief from hot weather conditions, it’s important for people who use them regularly to be aware of their potential negative impacts on their health and take steps accordingly such as using higher-quality filters or maintaining proper humidity levels indoors with a humidifier when necessary
