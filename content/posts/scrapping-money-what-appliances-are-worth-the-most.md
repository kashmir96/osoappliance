## Maximizing Reuse Value: Which Appliances are Worth Keeping? 

When it comes to getting rid of old appliances, many homeowners are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Investing in brand-new replacements for old washers and dryers, refrigerators, and ovens can quickly add up - yet scrapping them might net you some extra cash. 

You may be wondering what’s worth keeping and what should be scrapped. To help get you started, we’ll break down the basics of releasing the most value back for your old appliances, as well as help you decide whether it’s worth fixing or replacing them. 

When it comes to appliances worth keeping, the most important factor to consider is the age and condition of the appliance. If it’s in good condition but dated, consider investing a bit into sprucing it up. You can often upgrade the features, investing a fraction of the amount you would have paid for a whole new appliance and get just the amount of “bang for your buck” you need. If you have an older, but still functional appliance, it might be a better idea to opt for a repair or replace only specific parts if necessary.

Many appliances are also worth scrapping for a cash return if you no longer need them. Depending on the parts, you can sometimes make a decent return from scrap yards. Of course, some appliances are more valuable than others due to the fact that certain metals contain more value than others. For example, copper is among the most popular options since it holds its value really well, while aluminum on the other hand might only get you a fraction of the price you paid. 

As you can see, there are a lot of factors to take into consideration when weighing the costs of repairing, replacing, or scrapping an appliance. If you’re unsure of what to do, it’s best to research the condition of the appliance and calculate the potential return. In the end, the decision is up to you. 

No matter what you decide, it’s important to make sure you get the best bang for your buck.
