A commercial washing machine is an essential appliance for any business or organisation that needs to regularly wash large amounts of laundry. These machines are larger and more powerful than standard residential models, making them ideal for places such as hotels, restaurants and hospitals. If you’re looking for a commercial washing machine in New Zealand, there are a few things you should know before making your purchase.

The first thing to consider when purchasing a commercial washing machine is its capacity. Different models have different capacities and it’s important to select one that is large enough to handle the amount of laundry you need to process each day or week. Look for machines with bigger drums if you’re dealing with large loads on a regular basis. Also, consider the speed of the spin cycle – many commercial machines have higher spin speeds than residential ones which can help reduce drying time significantly.

Next, look at the features offered by different models of commercial washing machine NZ has available. Many machines come with energy-saving technologies such as automatic water level control which helps reduce water consumption by automatically adjusting the water level depending on how much clothes are loaded into it. Additionally, some machines offer specific programmes designed specifically for delicate items like silk or wool garments – these specialised cycles help prevent garment damage while still providing thorough cleaning results. Look out for other features like delayed start timers and preset programmes too (such as sanitation cycles) if they would be useful in your particular situation. 

Finally, think about what type of warranty comes with your chosen model as this will give you peace of mind if something were to go wrong in the future – most manufacturers provide at least one year's warranty on their products but check what conditions apply before buying yours so you know exactly what cover is provided should anything go wrong during its lifetime. 

Overall, when choosing a new commercial washing machine ensure that it meets all your needs in terms of size and capacity whilst also offering all the necessary features required by your business or organisation - this way you can be sure that it will provide long-lasting performance without costing too much money over time!
