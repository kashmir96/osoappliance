# Washing machine not filling with water

If your washing machine isn't filling with water, it's likely due to a clogged inlet screen, a faulty water inlet valve, or an issue with the water pressure or pumps.

The first thing to check is the inlet screen. This is located on the back of the washer and can become clogged with lint and dirt over time. To clean it, simply unscrew the hose and remove any debris that may be blocking the flow of water.

If that doesn't solve your problem, then you may have an issue with your water inlet valve. This is responsible for letting water into your washer and can become blocked or damaged over time. To check it, you'll need to remove the back panel of your washer and locate the valve. If it appears to be blocked or damaged, then you'll need to replace it.

The pump also plays an important role in filling up a washing machine. If the pump is not working correctly, then it won't be able to draw enough water into the washer. To check this, you'll need to remove the back panel and locate the pump. If it appears to be blocked or damaged, then you'll need to replace it.

Finally, if neither of those solutions work then you may have an issue with your home's water pressure. Low pressure can cause problems with filling up a washing machine as well as other appliances like dishwashers and toilets. To fix this issue, you'll need to contact a plumber who can assess your home's plumbing system and make any necessary repairs or adjustments to get things running smoothly again.

No matter what the cause of your washing machine not filling up with water is, these steps should help you identify and fix the problem quickly so that you can get back to doing laundry without any further delay!
