## Solving Water Dispenser Issues at the Office
Many offices rely on water coolers to provide cold, refreshing water to their employees. Often, these coolers are essential to ensuring employees are able to concentrate and stay hydrated. Unfortunately, several common issues can arise that can be disruptive, such as water tasting bad, not properly cooling, or a loud humming noise that persists. 

There are several basic troubleshooting measures that can be undertaken when attempting to fix a water cooler issue. Depending on the issue, the issue might be fixed with a few steps or require the assistance of a repair technician. 

If the water has an unusual taste, one of the first things to do is look for any visible signs of being dirty or contaminated. This can be done by cleaning the dispenser, changing the water bottle, and also making sure water bottles don’t become overfilled as this can cause water to become stale and acquire a funny taste over time.

If the water is not cooling properly, the cause may be the condenser and evaporator coils, or the compressor unit. One way to check is by feeling at the back of the unit and seeing if the coils feel too warm. The condenser and evaporator coils should always be kept clean, and if these are dirty it can affect cooling performance. In these cases, it is strongly advised to seek professional help.

Finally, if the water cooler is making a constant humming noise, the presence of an electrical problem like a loose wire should be checked. If the unit is making a noise but no light or water is coming out, it could be an indicator of a broken compressor, and a service technician should be called immediately.

With the help of following these steps, it is usually possible to detect and solve any water cooler related issues. For more serious cases, getting professional help from an appliance technician may be necessary.

The safety and performance of office water coolers should never be underestimated, and following the aforementioned steps can help to ensure employees have access to clean, safe and cool water.
