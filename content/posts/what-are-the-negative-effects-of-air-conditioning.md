Air conditioning has become a necessary part of our lives in many parts of the world, especially during the hot summer months. Unfortunately, air conditioning has some negative effects on both our health and environment. 

One of the most important negative effects of air conditioning is its contribution to global warming. Air conditioners use refrigerants that contribute to global warming when released into the atmosphere. Additionally, the electricity used to run air conditioners also contributes to global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from power plants. 

Air conditioners can also be bad for your health due to their ability to spread airborne diseases such as influenza and Legionnaireâ€™s disease. Air conditioners can also cause dehydration if not properly maintained or used for extended periods of time due to their ability to dry out indoor air quality. Furthermore, if not properly maintained or serviced regularly, air conditioners can become a breeding ground for mold, mildew and other allergens that can aggravate asthma symptoms and allergies in susceptible individuals. 

Finally, air conditioning systems require large amounts of energy which results in higher energy bills for homeowners and businesses alike. Additionally, when running inefficiently they consume more energy than necessary resulting in even higher energy costs and increased emissions from power plants producing this excess electricity. 

In conclusion, while air conditioning provides many benefits it is important to be aware of its potential negative impacts on our health and environment so we can take steps towards reducing them while still enjoying a comfortable environment during hot summer months.
