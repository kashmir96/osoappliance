## Uncovering How Much Electricity an Oven Uses Per Hour

It’s no secret that appliances are one of the biggest contributors to your monthly electricity bill. But what about the specifics? Have you ever wondered exactly how much electricity does an oven use per hour?

That’s an important question to consider when researching the best type of appliance for your home, and it’s the primary focus of this article. We’ll take a look at the estimated wattage an oven uses and explore the factors that can influence this number.

The wattage an oven requires changes depending on the type of oven you choose. Most electric ovens need around 2,500-3,500 watts while gas ovens only use 800-1,100 watts. Another factor to consider is how long and often you use the oven. To paint a clearer picture, let’s jump right into the specifics.

A standard electric oven on the lower end of the wattage range uses an average of 2,550 watts per hour. This is typically enough to power a 5-burner range and an oven. A convection oven typically requires even more wattage – around 3,000-3,400 watts per hour. That’s due to the additional energy necessary to power the convection fan.

Gas ovens only use a fraction of the electricity of their electric counterparts. A gas oven averages around 800-1,100 watts per hour. This can be one of the most cost-effective options if you’re looking to reduce your monthly electricity bills.

That said, some ovens can actually use even less energy. Wall ovens typically use 1/3 less wattage than a standard range oven, or around 1,500 watts per hour. To put that into perspective, a wall oven uses the same amount of electricity as the average incandescent light bulb.

It’s also worth mentioning that double ovens require around the same amount of electricity as one single oven. If you’re interested in cutting down on your electricity use, you can opt for a single oven rather than a double oven.

To sum it up, the wattage an oven uses per hour can range from 800-3,500 watts depending on the type, size, and features of your oven. To learn more about the best oven for you and your family, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
