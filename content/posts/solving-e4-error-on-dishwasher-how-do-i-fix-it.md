## Fixing E4 Error on a Dishwasher

It can be frustrating to get an error code on your dishwasher and not know how to fix it. The E4 error code can appear on several different dishwashers, and usually means that the water isn't draining properly. Luckily, there is usually a relatively simple remedy to this problem.

The main cause of the E4 error code is a blocked drainage hose or filter. If the dishwasher's drainage hose is blocked, water cannot be drained properly and the E4 error will be displayed. The drain hose must be checked for blockages and the filter must be cleaned to resolve the problem. The filter can be accessed by unscrewing the lower spout panel from the inside of the dishwasher.

Another common cause of the E4 error code is a kinked or blocked drain hose. This can often be resolved by gently bending the drain hose back into place and ensuring that it is not kinked or blocked. The dishwasher also needs to be level and have no obstructions in the way, as an uneven installation or obstruction can also stop the water from draining properly.

In some cases, it may also be necessary to replace the drain hose if it is particularly old or worn. This should be done by a qualified technician, as a malfunctioning or incorrectly installed hose can cause further problems with the dishwasher.

In summary, the E4 error code normally means that the water isn't properly draining away. The cause of this can usually be determined by checking the drainage hose and filter, and by ensuring that the installation is level and there are no other obstructions in the way. If the problem persists, it is recommended to contact a qualified technician.
