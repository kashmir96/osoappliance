## Solving Problems with Home Food Dehydrators

Using a home food dehydrator is a great way to preserve your favorite fruits and vegetables for longer periods of time. But, trouble may happen when you run your dehydrator, leading to frustrating problems that can ruin your project. Here are a few steps for troubleshooting common food dehydrator issues. 

If your dehydrator isn't operating, check to make sure that the power is connected and the fuse is working. You can also take off the back of the dehydrator to inspect the elements for any signs of burning or other damage. If your dehydrator is working but the food you've placed inside isn't changing after a few hours, it's likely that your dehydrator isn't set to the correct temperature. Check your owner's manual if you're unsure how to adjust the temperature and the timing on your appliance.

Dehydrators usually make some noise, so if the sound of your unit seems to be an issue, you may need to adjust the fan speed. By increasing the airflow you can prevent any uneven temperature distribution and ensure your food is being dried thoroughly.

It's also important to make sure that the food you put in your dehydrator has all been cut to the same size. The slices should be thin and uniform in order to ensure the best drying. You can also adjust the distance between the trays that you place your food on inside the dehydrator. If you have too much food, increase the distance to promote better air circulation and faster drying times.

If you've tried all of these techniques and the food still isn't turning out the way you would like it to, it may be time to contact an appliance repair technician.
