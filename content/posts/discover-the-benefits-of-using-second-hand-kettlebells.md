Another benefit of purchasing a pre-owned kettlebell is that it won’t be as intimidating as a brand new one. This can be especially helpful for someone that is just starting out with exercises and workouts using equipment. Buyiing used can help to gain confidence in newbie's since they have the knowledge that many people have used the same piece of equipment before and if it has held up then chances are it will continue to hold up with continued use.
