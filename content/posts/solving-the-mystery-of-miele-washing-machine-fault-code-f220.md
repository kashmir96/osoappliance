## Uncovering the Mystery of Miele Washing Machine Fault Code F220
It can be incredibly frustrating when your Miele washing machine stops working and displays a fault code. You may be unsure of what it means or how to fix it. Fortunately, with the Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary from ABC Appliance, you can easily remedy this problem.

The F220 fault code indicates that the washing machine has not received water in the allotted time. The most common cause of this is blockage in the water supply hoses. To check, disconnect the water supply and blow into the hose to clear any potential blockages.
