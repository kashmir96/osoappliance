If the temperature is constantly fluctuating, it will put strain on the motor, which could eventually lead to a complete failure. Check your freezer's temperature often can help you nip this problem in the bud and identify when a replacement is necessary. 

Another sign that your freezer is failing is the sound it emits when it is running. A properly functioning freezer should produce a low hum that should be consistent in sound. But if you notice that your freezer is both louder and the sound is fluctuating, this could be a sign that the motor is failing and needs to be replaced.
