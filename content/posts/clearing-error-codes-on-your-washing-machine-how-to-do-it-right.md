## Knowing What to Do When You Receive an Error Code

We've all been there - your washing machine has completed a cycle and then displayed an error code that you don't understand.Error codes can be daunting,but they don't have to be. In this blog, we will discuss how to properly clear error codes on your washing machine.

When a washing machine has completed a cycle and an error code has appeared, the first step is to find out exactly what the code means. If you're not familiar with it, look up the code in our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary - this should explain what the issue is. 

Once you know what the error code means, you can begin taking the appropriate steps to correct the issue. Many errors are easy to troubleshoot and fix, such as a malfunctioning drain pump or incorrect temperature setting. However, if the problem is more serious, then you may need to call a professional for assistance.

Before you begin, you should make sure you disconnect the power supply to the washing machine. This will help to ensure your safety, as well as prevent any further damage to the machine. Once all power has been disconnected, check any visible wires or parts for damage or fraying, as this may be what is causing the error. 

Once these checks have been made, it is a good idea to clean the filter of the machine. This can often help eliminate some errors. After all of these steps have been taken, reconnect the power to the washing machine and run another cycle to see if the error has been cleared. 

Clearing error codes from your washing machine can be straightforward, so it is often a good idea to attempt to fix the issue yourself before calling for professional help. However, if you do need help, our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary should help you out.
