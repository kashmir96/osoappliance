Broiling is a cooking method that uses direct heat to quickly cook food. It is similar to grilling in that it cooks the food from above, but it uses higher temperatures and shorter cooking times than grilling. Broiling is often used to cook meats such as steak, fish, and poultry, as well as vegetables.

To broil food, you place it on a rack in an oven that has been preheated to a high temperature (usually between 500-550°F). The food should be placed close to the heating element at the top of the oven. Once the food is placed in the oven, it will be exposed to direct heat from above which cooks it quickly. The food should be turned occasionally during cooking so that both sides are evenly cooked.

Broiling is a great way to quickly cook foods without having to use too much oil or fat. It also helps retain moisture and flavor in meat and vegetables. Since the cooking process happens so quickly, you don’t have to worry about overcooking your food either!
