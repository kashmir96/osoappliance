Are you hearing strange noises coming from your oven while it’s heating up? You’re not alone. Many people experience the same issue and wonder what’s causing the noise and whether they should call an appliance repair service. 

The good news is that most of the time, ovens make noise when they are warming up due to normal operation. When your oven reaches a certain temperature, it may expand inside due to heat, which can cause a popping or rumbling sound. This is usually nothing to be concerned about and will likely subside once the oven has reached its desired temperature. 

However, if the sound persists or gets louder over time, it could indicate an issue that needs to be addressed by a qualified appliance repair technician. Before calling for service, there are a few things you can try: 

• Check for any loose screws or other parts on the inside of the oven that might be rattling or vibrating as it heats up 
• Open and close the door several times to see if that makes a difference 
• Make sure all knobs are set in their correct positions 
• Clean out any debris inside of your oven (this could include food residue and grease)
