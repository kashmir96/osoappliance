Sears is one of the most recognizable names in appliance parts. They offer a wide selection of replacement parts for most major brands of appliances, including washers, dryers, refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, and more. Whether you’re looking for a replacement filter or a new part to repair a broken appliance, Sears has you covered.

When shopping for appliance parts at Sears, you can choose from OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts or aftermarket parts. OEM parts are made by the same company that manufactured your appliance and are designed specifically to fit your model. Aftermarket parts are typically cheaper than OEM but may not always be as reliable as OEM options. It’s important to research both types of options before making your purchase decision.

Sears also offers an array of repair services and installation services in addition to their large selection of appliance parts. If you don’t feel comfortable tackling the job yourself or don’t have the tools necessary to complete it properly, Sears can help with everything from diagnosing the problem to installing the part correctly so that it works properly again. 

One great thing about shopping with Sears is that they offer free shipping on orders over $35 and free returns on most items within 30 days of purchase (some restrictions apply). This makes it easy and convenient to get what you need without having to worry about added costs or shipping delays due to standard ground shipping times. 

Whether you’re looking for replacement filters or entire new components for your appliances, Sears Appliance Parts has you covered! With their wide selection of products and helpful customer service staff ready to assist with any questions you might have along the way – there really isn’t any better place than Sears when it comes time to find just what you need!
