## Troubleshoot an F36 Error on a Bosch Dishwasher
Dealing with a Bosch dishwasher's F36 error code can be irritating and even a little overwhelming. But it's important to stay calm as there could be a simple solution that's easy to fix.

If you notice that your dishwasher is displaying the F36 error code, the first thing you'd want to do is to unplug your dishwasher and wait a few minutes before you turn it back on. This is the easiest way to see if the F36 error was simply a temporary glitch. If this doesn't help, the next step would be to check any hoses that may have become blocked or clogged by debris.

If this still doesn't solve the problem, then you need to look into a new heater relay. The relay will switch the heating element on at the right times during the cycle and if it isn't working properly it can cause the F36 error. Testing the relay will tell you if it's to blame or not.

Finally, if none of the above steps solve the error, contact one of our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to come and take a look at your Bosch dishwasher. The technician should be able to identify the source of your issue and provide you with a solution.

Dealing with a Bosch dishwasher's F36 error code may require a bit of troubleshooting, but it's important to remember that the code usually won't indicate a major mechanical problem. To get to the bottom of what's causing your F36 error, consider following the steps above. If this doesn't resolve the issue, searching for an experienced appliance repair technician can also save you time and stress.
