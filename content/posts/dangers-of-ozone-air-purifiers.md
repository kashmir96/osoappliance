Ozone air purifiers are electronic devices designed to clean the air in homes and other spaces by releasing ozone gas. Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms that can be used to oxidize contaminants like bacteria, mold, and odors in the air. While it’s true that ozone can be effective at eliminating certain pollutants from indoor air, it’s important to understand the potential dangers of using an ozone air purifier. 

One of the most serious risks associated with ozone air purifiers is their potential to create unsafe levels of ozone inside your home. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends keeping indoor levels of ozone below 0.05 parts per million (ppm). However, some studies have found that many commercial-grade ozone generators exceed this level when used in enclosed spaces like bedrooms or living rooms. Overexposure to high levels of this gas can cause a variety of respiratory problems and irritate lung tissue, leading to coughing, chest pain, and shortness of breath. 

In addition to creating health risks for those living in homes where an ozonator is being used, these devices may also cause damage to certain materials found inside buildings like carpets or furniture fabrics. This is because when exposed to high concentrations of ozone gas over long periods of time these materials may become discolored or brittle as they break down into smaller pieces due to oxidation caused by the gas molecules present in the atmosphere. 

Finally, some studies have also suggested that regular use of an ozonator could potentially increase your risk for developing asthma or allergies over time if you are exposed regularly enough due its ability deplete beneficial compounds such as nitrogen dioxide which act as natural agents protecting against airborne allergens and pollutants indoors. 

Overall, while there are certainly benefits associated with using an ozonator such as improved indoor air quality and decreased presence odors caused by smoke or pet dander; it’s important for homeowners research all available options before deciding which type is best for their home environment given its potential risks outlined above
