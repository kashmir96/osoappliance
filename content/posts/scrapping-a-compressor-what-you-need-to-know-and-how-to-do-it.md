## Know What it Takes to Scrap a Compressor
The process of scrapping a compressor involves removal of the component from an appliance, such as a refrigerator or air conditioner, for recycling or disposal. Refrigerator and air conditioner compressors are manufactured with hazardous materials such as CFCs and oils, and so must be disposed of properly in accordance with the laws and regulations set by a local recycling facility or hazardous waste management center. It is important to handle these components in a safe manner and to properly clean any remaining materials prior to disposing of them.

2. Wear protective equipment, such as gloves and safety glasses, when handling the compressor.

3. Disconnect the compressor, which is usually found at the back of the appliance. Do not attempt to disconnect power cords, as this may be dangerous.

4. Securely package the compressor in a container, such as a cardboard box. 

5. Allow any refrigerant or oils to escape according to manufacturer instructions.

6. Locate and comply with any applicable local laws and regulations for disposing of or recycling a compressor.

7. Contact your local recycling facility or hazardous waste management center for information on how best to dispose of or recycle the component.

### Important Safety Tips
