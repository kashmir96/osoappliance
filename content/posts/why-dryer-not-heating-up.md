If your dryer is not heating up, it can be a cause of frustration. You may not be able to finish the laundry cycle without warm air, and the problem needs to be addressed quickly. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue before contacting an appliance repair technician from our directory. 

First, check that your dryer is getting power. Make sure the unit is plugged in and that any circuit breakers or fuses have not tripped. Additionally, make sure the power cord connections are secure at both ends (on the dryer as well as in any wall outlets). If you have a gas dryer, make sure that it is connected to a working gas supply and that all valves are open. 

Next, make sure lint hasn’t built up inside your dryer’s exhaust ducts or venting system blocking airflow from exiting the machine properly. Clogged lint traps can also decrease heat levels inside the drum resulting in longer drying times or no heat at all. Clean out any lint buildup as much as possible using a vacuum wand or small brush before running another cycle. 

If these steps don’t solve your heating issues then it may indicate a more serious underlying problem such as broken heating coils or faulty thermostats/temp sensors which will require professional service by an experienced appliance repair technician from our directory to diagnose and fix correctly.. In most cases they should be able to help you determine whether parts need replacing or if other repairs should be considered while they’re onsite inspecting your machine.
