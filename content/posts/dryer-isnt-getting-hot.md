If your dryer isn't getting hot, it can be a frustrating problem. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue and get your dryer up and running again.

First, check to make sure the dryer is plugged in and that the circuit breaker hasn't been tripped. If it is, reset the breaker and try again.

Next, check the lint filter. If it's clogged, it can prevent heat from properly circulating in the dryer. Clean the filter and try again.

If the lint filter is clean and the dryer is still not getting hot, it may be due to a problem with the heating element. Unplug the dryer and use a multimeter to test the heating element for continuity. If the multimeter does not detect any continuity, the heating element may need to be replaced.

If the heating element is working, the problem may be due to a faulty thermostat. Unplug the dryer and use a multimeter to test the thermostat for continuity. If the multimeter does not detect any continuity, the thermostat may need to be replaced.

Finally, if all of the above steps have been completed and the dryer is still not getting hot, it may be due to a problem with the venting system. Check to make sure the venting system is clear of any blockages and that the exhaust vent is not kinked or obstructed.

If all of these steps have been completed and the dryer is still not getting hot, it's time to call a professional to inspect the dryer and diagnose the problem. A qualified technician will be able to determine the cause of the issue and recommend the best course of action.
