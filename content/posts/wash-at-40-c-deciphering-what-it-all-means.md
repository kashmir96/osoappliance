## Decoding Wash At 40 Degrees

On most household appliances, such as washing machines or dishwashers, you’ll often notice a temperature setting indicator. This indicator is typically a label telling you to “Wash at 40 Degrees”. But, it could be asking for something else, and it’s important to understand exactly what it means to ensure you stay safe and your appliances running correctly.

Washing your clothes, dishes, and other items in your household appliances affects how clean they get and the energy efficiency of your appliances. It’s recommended to wash at lower temperatures only when necessary, such as when caring for delicate fabrics. Generally speaking, any temperature above 40 Degrees Celsius should be considered a safe washing temperature, but this could vary depending on the type and amount of items being washed. 

The best rule of thumb to remember is that if you’re ever unsure which temperature to set your washing machine or dishwasher to, you can comfortably choose 40 Degrees Celsius without harm. This setting is widely accepted as the safest and most energy-efficient temperature for washing items.
