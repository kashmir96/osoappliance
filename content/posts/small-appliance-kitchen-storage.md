When it comes to kitchen storage, small appliances often get overlooked. But given the number of countertop appliances we use on a daily basis, from blenders and toasters to air fryers and Instant Pots, they can quickly take up valuable space. The good news is that with the right storage solutions, you can keep your small appliances organized and out of sight when not in use. 

If you have an open shelf or shelves in your kitchen, storing small appliances on them is a great way to make the most of limited counter space while keeping them easily accessible. Consider using tiered shelves or stackable baskets for items like blenders and mixers that take up more room. You can also put everyday items like your coffee maker or electric kettle front-and-center for easy access while stashing larger items like food processors on the top shelf for occasional use. 

If you’d rather not leave your small appliances out in the open, consider investing in an appliance garage or cupboard. These are usually tall cupboards with doors that tuck away all sorts of kitchen gadgets from stand mixers and food processors to choppers and slow cookers when not in use. If you don’t want to commit to a full appliance garage just yet, some models are designed as pull-out drawers so you can test it out first before committing fully! 

For those who prefer things even tidier than an appliance garage offers, there’s always under-cabinet storage options too! Many models are specifically designed for storing small kitchen gadgets such as blenders and mixers while still keeping them within easy reach when needed—just check if they fit under your cabinets first! You could also opt for wall-mounted racks instead if space allows; these usually come with several hooks which you can hang pots pans from too if desired. 

Ultimately, how much (or how little) space you have will dictate what type of small appliance storage solution works best for you—but whatever option you choose should help keep things tidy without compromising on accessibility!
