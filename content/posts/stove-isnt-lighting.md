If your stove isn't lighting, it could be due to a number of different issues. Here are some of the most common causes and what you can do to troubleshoot them:

1. Pilot Light - If your stove is equipped with a pilot light, it may have gone out. Check to make sure the pilot light is lit and if it isn't, you'll need to relight it.

2. Gas Supply - If the pilot light is lit but the burners still aren't lighting, it could be due to a lack of gas supply. Check that your gas line is connected properly and that there are no leaks or blockages in the line.

3. Igniter - If your stove has an electronic igniter, it may not be working properly. Try replacing the igniter and see if that solves the problem.

4. Burner Valves - The burner valves may be stuck or broken, preventing gas from flowing properly. Try cleaning or replacing them as needed.

5. Thermostat - If your stove has a thermostat, it may need to be adjusted or replaced if it's not working properly.

If none of these solutions work, then you may need to call in a professional for assistance with diagnosing and repairing your stove's issue.
