## Resetting your Washing Program to Refresh its Performance

When your washing machine isn't running as well as it should, it might be time for a reset. Resetting your machine's washing program can reset its settings and performance back to normal, saving you time and money on repairs or a new machine. In this blog, we'll discuss how to reset your washing program and why it's important to do so.

To reset your washing program, it will depend on the type of machine. If you have a front-loading washing machine, you can usually perform a reset by pressing the start/pause button for a few seconds to reboot the system. Top-loading washing machines typically require unplugging the machine and then waiting a few minutes before turning it back on.

Resetting your washing program allows your machine to return to its original settings. This means it can start fresh with the correct settings and automatically choose the correct water levels and temperatures, so you don't need to fiddle with manual settings. Resetting also clears the error codes stored in memory, so if you were getting errors that you couldn't figure out, you know to perform a reset.

If your washing machine isn't working as efficiently as it should, resetting the program can fix performance issues such as prolonged wash cycles, uneven agitation, or water problems. If your machine has stopped working entirely, however, a reset may not fix the problem and you should use our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to diagnose the issue.

Resetting your washing program only takes a few minutes and should be done periodically to maintain the best performance from your machine. Doing so can save you from having to shell out big bucks to get your machine repaired or even replaced.

Don't forget to check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) if you're encountering any errors with your washing machine. With the right knowledge and resources, you can easily diagnose and troubleshoot any appliance issues so you can get back to doing what's important!
