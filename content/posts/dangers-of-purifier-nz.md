Are you considering buying a water purifier for your home in New Zealand? While this may be a wise decision to ensure that you and your family are drinking clean, safe water, there are some potential dangers associated with using a water purifier. 

The biggest danger associated with using a water purifier is the risk of contamination. Depending on the type of filter used, some contaminants can remain in the final product if not filtered properly. This can include bacteria, viruses, parasites and heavy metals such as lead or arsenic which can all be harmful to human health. Therefore it is important to check what type of filter is used and whether it is rated to remove these contaminants from the water before purchasing any filtration system. 

Another danger of using a water purifier is the potential for mechanical failure or blockages within the filter itself. If these occur then it could potentially result in contaminated or untreated water entering your home’s supply. To avoid this risk make sure to use only reputable brands and regularly check and clean filters as per manufacturer instructions to ensure they are working correctly. 

Finally, depending on the type of system used there may also be other risks associated with them such as chlorine byproducts being released during filtration or incorrect levels of minerals being added back into treated water which can lead to adverse effects on human health over time. Therefore it is important to do thorough research before selecting any specific system and make sure that all necessary precautions are taken during installation and maintenance processes. 

Overall while using a water purification system at home in New Zealand can provide many benefits, there are still certain risks associated with them that should not be overlooked when making any purchasing decisions. Therefore it’s important to do your research carefully first before deciding on any particular product so that you can ensure you’re drinking safe, clean drinking water at all times!
