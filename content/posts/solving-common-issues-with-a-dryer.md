## Resolving the Most Frequent Problems with Your Dryer

Managing daily tasks can become difficult when encountering disruptions in your routine. When you have a dryer problem, it can have an effect on you and your familyâ€™s activities. Many of the common problems with a dryer are easy to troubleshoot and resolve without the need of calling an appliance repair technician. It is always helpful to know some simple tips which can help you get your dryer up and running quickly.

###### Problem: Dryer Won't Start

The most common issue with a dryer is that it won't start. The first thing to check is that the dryer is receiving power, test the outlet with a multi-meter or plug another appliance into it to make sure it is functional. There may also be a blown fuse or the circuit breaker controlling the outlet could have been tripped. Always check these first before assuming the problem is with the dryer itself.


###### Problem: Dryer is Not Heating

If your dryer is receiving power, then it could be a problem with the heating element or thermostat. All dryers have a thermal fuse which can blow to protect the dryer from overheating, this fuse must be replaced before the dryer is operational again.

###### Problem: Unusual Noises

Noisy dryers are usually the result of too much lint buildup in the lint filter, lint screen, or in the exhaust duct. Also, check to make sure nothing is stuck in the dryer drum between the dryer wall and drum frame.

###### Problem: Clothes are Taking Too Long to Dry

This problem is usually caused by an accumulation of lint as well as undersized house exhaust duct. Make sure the proper sized vent duct is used (based on length and number of elbows). A clogged exhaust duct can reduce the airflow which decreases the drying time.

It is important to take the steps to take care of your dryer, as they are expensive and will cost more down the line to fix or replace. If you have tried the above advice and still have an issue, it is best to seek professional help.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips for Dryers

1. **My clothes are taking too long to dry. What can I do?** 
Check the venting system to ensure all ducts are clear of lint and debris. Additionally, inspect the dryer lint filter after each cycle to prevent build-up and ensure air is circulating freely.

2. **My dryer is producing an unusual squeaking noise. Is this normal?** 
No, this is not normal and may indicate the dryer belt is loose or worn. Inspect the dryer belt for breaks or cracks and replace if necessary.

3. **My dryer is not heating up at all. How do I fix this?** 
If the dryer is not heating up, it likely means the heating element may need to be replaced. First, check the circuit breakers in the main electric panel. If the breaker has tripped, reset it. If that does not fix the issue, then contact a professional for assistance.

4. **How do I clean the dryer lint screen?** 
Cleaning the dryer lint screen should be done after each cycle to remove lint and debris and ensure the dryer is running optimally. To clean the lint screen, remove it and rinse with a damp cloth. Allow to air dry on a towel for a few minutes before reinstalling.

5. **My dryer isn't tumbling. What could be causing this issue?** 
If the dryer is not tumbling, it could be due to a number of reasons. Firstly, check the drive belt to ensure it is securely attached and in good condition. Additionally, check the suspension rods and springs to ensure they are not broken or loose. If everything checks out, then contact a professional for further assistance.
