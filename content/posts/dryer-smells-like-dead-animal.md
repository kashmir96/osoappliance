So, your dryer smells like a dead animal. It’s a smell that can be difficult to ignore and can cause a great deal of discomfort. But what could be causing this smell and how can you get rid of it?

First off, the cause of the smell could be anything from lint buildup to a dead animal that has made its way into your dryer vent. Lint buildup is a common culprit, as it can trap moisture and create a perfect environment for bacteria and mold to grow. This can create an unpleasant odor that will linger until the lint is removed.

Another potential cause of the smell is a dead animal that has made its way into your dryer vent. This is a more serious issue, as the animal can cause a blockage in the vent and create a fire hazard. If you suspect this is the cause of the smell, you should contact a professional to have the vent inspected and cleared.

No matter the cause, the best way to get rid of the smell is to clean your dryer. This can be done by removing the lint trap and cleaning it out, as well as vacuuming the inside of the dryer and wiping down the walls. This should help to remove any buildup of lint or other debris that could be causing the smell.

Additionally, you should also have your dryer vent inspected and cleaned by a professional. This will help to ensure that any blockage or buildup is cleared out, reducing the chances of a fire hazard and helping to get rid of the smell.

If you’re dealing with a dryer that smells like a dead animal, don’t panic. With a bit of cleaning and a professional inspection of your dryer vent, you can get rid of the smell and enjoy a fresh, clean dryer once again.
