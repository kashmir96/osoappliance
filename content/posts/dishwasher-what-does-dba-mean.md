Dishwasher decibel rating (DBA) is a measure of how loud a dishwasher is when it is running. It is measured in decibels (dB), which is a unit of sound pressure. The higher the DBA rating, the louder the dishwasher will be.

DBA ratings are important to consider when purchasing a dishwasher, as a dishwasher that is too loud can be disruptive and unpleasant to have in your home. Dishwashers with lower DBA ratings tend to be quieter and more energy-efficient than those with higher DBA ratings. When shopping for a dishwasher, look for one with a DBA rating of 45 dB or lower. This will ensure that your dishwasher is as quiet as possible.

In addition to DBA rating, it is also important to consider the size of the dishwasher, as larger dishwashers tend to be louder than smaller ones. If you are looking for a quiet dishwasher, you may want to choose a model that is smaller and has a lower DBA rating.
