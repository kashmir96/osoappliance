Using a dryer is a great way to save time and energy when it comes to drying your clothes. However, if you’re not familiar with the process, it can be a bit confusing. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use a dryer:

1. Sort Your Clothes: Before you start drying your clothes, you’ll want to sort them into categories based on fabric type. This will help ensure that all of your items are dried properly and without any damage.

2. Choose the Right Cycle: Different fabrics require different drying cycles, so make sure you select the right one for each type of fabric you’re drying. Most dryers come with settings for delicate items, normal items, and heavy items like towels and jeans.

3. Set the Temperature: Depending on the type of fabric you’re drying, you may need to adjust the temperature setting on your dryer. Delicate fabrics should be dried at a lower temperature than heavier items like jeans or towels.

4. Add Dryer Sheets (Optional): If desired, you can add a dryer sheet to your load for an extra boost of freshness and static protection. Simply add one sheet to the drum before starting the cycle.

5. Start the Cycle: Once everything is loaded up and ready to go, press “Start” on your dryer and let it do its thing! Depending on how full your load is, it could take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour before everything is fully dried and ready to be put away in your closet or dresser drawer. 

And there you have it! With these simple steps, you should now have no problem using a dryer like a pro!
