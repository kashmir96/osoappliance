## Troubleshooting Common Issues with LG Washing Machines

Nobody wants their laundry day to turn into a nightmare, but unfortunately, LG washing machines can sometimes suffer from malfunctions and prevent your routine from running smoothly. And without some technical know-how, it can be hard to know where to start when troubleshooting these issues.
 
The following are some of the common problems you might experience with your LG washing machine, and some helpful advice on how to resolve them: 

* **Leaking.** LG units typically use a sealed pump and motor assembly, so if you are experiencing leaks you may need to replace the gasket or bearings. Additionally, make sure the drain hose is properly connected and is not kinked.

* **Drum noises.** Washing machines make a lot of noise during the spin cycle, but if you are hearing unusual grinding or buzzing noises, it could indicate that the appliance needs to be serviced. Inspect the drum and replace any out-of-alignment components.

* **Electrical faults.** If you are experiencing electrical faults with your machine, make sure you have checked the power cord and electrical outlet for any damage or obstruction.

* **Soap Dispenser not working.** Check the dispenser for any clogs, as this is often the cause of this issue. If necessary, disassemble it and clean it with a soft cloth or scrub brush.

* **Clothes coming out wet.** This may be caused by your washing machine not spinning at the right speed or not properly regulating the water levels. Inspect the pulley belt and spin motor, and replace as needed.

These are just some of the most frequent issues you may experience with your LG washing machine. Of course, there are many other potential problems, such as faulty door locks, Tub Flood Error Codes, or defective hoses or connecters, that may need to be addressed. If you do experience any of the more complex issues, the best course of action may be to consult the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for help.

Malfunctioning appliances can be an annoying setback, but if you have some basic troubleshooting skills, you will likely be able to get your LG washing machine up and running once again. It's always a good practice to make sure your appliance is maintained regularly to avoid any major breakdowns, but if the worst happens, the comprehensive appliance error codes glossary is a great resource to help you out.
