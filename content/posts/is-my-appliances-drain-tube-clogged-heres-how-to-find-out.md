## Is My Appliance's Drain Tube Clogged?

If your household appliance is not draining water properly, it could be a sign of a clogged drain tube. Often, dozens of different problems can create a similar symptom, so it’s important to take the time to properly diagnose the issue before starting any repairs. In this blog, we’ll explore the signs of a clogged appliance drain tube, and provide some tips to safely diagnose it yourself. 

One of the first signs that you might have an issue with your appliance’s drain tube is a pool of water forming near or around it. To isolate the potential problem, poke a hole near the water and measure the rate at which it drains away. If it moves slowly, or not at all, then you likely have a clogged drain tube. If you don’t mind getting your hands wet, you can also feel around the loop of the drain tube to see if you can feel the buildup of the blockage.

If the problem with your appliance’s drain tube still isn’t clear, you should check the drain connection in relation to the pump. If they aren’t properly connected, then it could be the source of your issue. If both of these checks still don’t reveal the source of the drainage problem, then you should refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for more information. 

An appliance clogged drain tube can be an irritating problem, but one that is fairly easy to diagnose and repair. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily determine if a clogged drain tube is the source of your appliance’s water problems. Are you still unsure of how to diagnose your appliance’s drain tube issues? Check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for more information.
