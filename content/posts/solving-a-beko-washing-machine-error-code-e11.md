## Troubleshooting the Beko Washing Machine Error Code E11 
If your Beko washing machine displays the Error Code E11, don't panic - we can help get you back on the path to clean clothes in no time!

Error Code E11 indicates a motor connection problem. The cause of this error code problem could be due to a faulty wiring harness, issue within the control unit, or a faulty motor. 

To resolve the issue, begin by unplugging the power cord from the wall for several minutes and then plugging it back in. This should reset the unit and the error code will clear. If the code does not clear and the machine is still non-operational, we recommend checking the wiring harnesses and the control unit. If you find any disconnected wires or visible damage to any of the wiring, replace and reconnect. If this does not resolve the issue, it is likely that the motor needs to be replaced.

The good news is that these types of repairs are often easy to complete and the necessary parts can be purchased at many appliance parts stores. With the right tools and knowledge, these repairs can be completed on your own or you may prefer to hire a technician to take care of the job.
