## Clearing the Error Code on Your Washing Machine
Most people don't know the ins and outs of their washing machine, let alone how to clear an error code when one pops up. Washing machine error codes can cause a lot of anxiety and can even stop you from doing laundry. But don't worry! Learning to clear the error code on your washing machine is simple and straightforward.

If you receive an error code on your washing machine, start by checking the manual and looking for what the code may mean. Some error codes may simply tell you to switch the machine off and on again. If that doesn’t work, the next thing to do is reset the machine to clear the code. To reset it, simply unplug the machine for about a minute, then plug it back in again. If the machine won’t reset, try the cycle again using a different setting.

If the error code persists and resetting the machine didn't work, you may need to contact a repair service. Certain error codes may be associated with specific hardware issues, like a broken agitator, that require a trained technician to repair. It’s possible that a part of the machine, such as the heating elements, is worn out or broken, and a technician will be able to replace it.

Nearly all modern washing machine models include a self-diagnosis system that can help you determine what the error code means and how to fix it. You can typically access this system by pressing a specific series of buttons. Look for the instructions for accessing the system and determining the error code in the machine’s manual.

Clearing the error code on your washing machine doesn't have to be a hassle. With the right instructions, you can easily take care of the problem and get back to doing laundry as usual. To get the most out of your machine and help protect it from future issues, make sure you take a look at our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview). By shopping with confidence, you’re sure to find the perfect machine for the job.
