Having a Bosch coffee machine at home is great for enjoying a hot coffee on the go and to start your morning. But at times, it might stop working and display an error code. Do not worry though, as this guide will explain how to diagnose and troubleshoot these issues.

The most common Bosch coffee machines that are prone to develop errors are the VeroBar, EQ9 and VeroCafe models. Some of the error codes you may see appear on the device's display are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8.

Error code 1: This code indicates an issue with the pressurized water system. You should check if there is enough water in the tank and if the water pressure is proper.
