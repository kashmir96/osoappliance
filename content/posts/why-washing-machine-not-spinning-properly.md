Are you finding that your washing machine isn’t spinning? Not being able to rely on your washing machine for clean clothes can be a real pain, and it’s important to identify the problem before you contact an appliance repair serviceman from our directory. 

There could be several reasons why your washing machine isn’t spinning, so it’s important to follow some simple diagnostics before calling in the experts. The following are some things you should check: 

1. Power supply - Make sure the power cord is securely plugged into the wall outlet and the circuit breaker hasn’t tripped. In some cases, if there is a power surge or outage, it can cause a fuse in the controls of the washer to blow out. 

2. Drum - Check if it is possible for anything obstructing or stuck between drum paddles which prevent proper rotation of drum while spinning cycle runs as this can put extra load on motor and stop washer from spinning properly. 

3. Belt - If belts have become worn out or broken then they need replacement as this will not allow motor to rotate agitator and spin drum properly during spin cycle process. Also make sure that belt has not slipped off pulleys due to improper installation otherwise replace with new one if required. 

 4 Motor – If all other components are running fine then check motor by putting voltage meter across its terminals while running spin cycles as low voltage will prevent proper functioning of motor causing unnecessary noise while running at slower speed than what should be expected normally during normal functioning of washer machine . Replace motor with new one if required after testing its voltage rating .

 5 Timer - Lastly check timer settings which control water level , temperature , spin cycle duration because these settings also determine whether washing machine run or not during specific cycles . Replace timer with new one if necessary after checking all functions available with old timer .

Once you have gone through these steps without finding any problems, then it could be time for a professional appliance repair serviceman from our directory who can help diagnose any deeper issues going on within your washer!
