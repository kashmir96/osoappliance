## Repairing a Washing Machine Seal: Tips for DIYers
Many of us use washing machines on a regular basis, however a faulty seal can cause them to be in need of repair. If you’re a DIYer who likes to take matters into your own hands, here are some handy tips to help you fix a broken seal on your washing machine.

To begin with, you’ll need to make sure you have the right supplies on hand. You’ll need a new seal of the same size and shape, a screwdriver, a pair of pliers and a damp cloth. Make sure that the replacement seal you obtain is the same size and shape as the existing one, and of the same material.

Unplug your washing machine from the wall and shut off the water supply. Begin by unscrewing the front and back panels, and then use your pliers to remove the old seal. Use the damp cloth to wipe any leftover residue away and make sure the seal area is all clear.

Take the new seal and carefully line it up with the area, then secure it into place. Be sure to make sure all sides of the seal fit snugly before fully securing it with the screws. Once the seal is in place, turn the water supply back on and reconnect the washing machine to the wall outlet before turning it on.
