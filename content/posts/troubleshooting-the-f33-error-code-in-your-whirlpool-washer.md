## Diagnosing F33 Error Code on a Whirlpool Washer

Troubleshooting appliance problems can be a tricky business, and a dreaded error code is often the worst part. If your Whirlpool washer is displaying an F33 error code, the cause and how to resolve the problem may not be immediately obvious. Read on to learn more about this error and how to approach resolving it.

The F33 error code signals an issue with the pressure switch of your Whirlpool washer. The pressure switch monitors the water entering the washer and once the set level is reached, the switch should communicate to the washer to close the water inlet valve. If this communication does not happen, the washer will display the F33 error. 

First, disconnect the power from the washer by unplugging it, or switching off the power at the breaker. Leave it off for no less than 15 minutes. Reconnect the power and try the unit again to see if the code has cleared. If it has, the issue has likely been resolved.

If the error is persistent, inspect the pressure switch for a loose hose, disconnected hose, blockage to the pressure switch or an inline fuse. Also, check that the water level is set to the correct amount. If all these are correct, the pressure switch may need to be replaced.

Troubleshooting the F33 error code on your Whirlpool washer may sound daunting, but you can figure out the root of the problem with a methodical and careful approach. If you need help or do not feel comfortable attempting the repair yourself, be sure to contact a licensed appliance repair technician.

Tackling appliance repair can be a daunting process. When your Whirlpool washer displays an F33 error code, the first step is to disconnect power from the unit and wait 15 minutes before attempting the unit again. If the error is still present, inspect the pressure switch for common issues. If the issue remains unresolved, consider enlisting the help of a professional appliance repair technician.
