## Identifying and Resolving Dishwasher Rack Issues
Are you having trouble with broken tines on your dishwasher rack? It can be a very stressful issue that creates a huge inconvenience for you and your family. It's essential to identify the issue immediately and find a reliable solution. Doing so can help you keep your dishes clean and safe, and has the added bonus of lowering your energy costs. 

The first thing to do when identifying dishwasher rack woes is to inspect the tines. Many times they can be seen sticking out and bent, or potentially even missing altogether. If the tines are bent, they can be straightened back out by hand. However, if they are missing, you might need to purchase replacements. Make sure you have the correct model number of the manufacturer before you purchase replacements, as many models have different sizes and shapes of tines that only fit that specific model.

In addition to examining the tines, you should also check the rack for any other signs of damage. This includes rust, cracks, and other signs of wear. If there are any issues with the rack itself, you may need to replace the rack or contact the manufacturer for a repair or replacement.

Finally, if the rack itself is still in good condition, you may want to examine the arms that hold the rack in place. Loose arms can cause the rack to be shaky and lead to tines becoming loose and bent. Tightening these arms properly will help ensure that the rack is secure and providing the best level of cleaning performance. 

Finding and repairing the issues with your dishwasher rack can be a time-consuming task, but it's important to do so to ensure your dishes are getting properly cleaned. If you're having trouble figuring out the problem or getting the repairs done, consider contacting a professional appliance repair technician in your area.
