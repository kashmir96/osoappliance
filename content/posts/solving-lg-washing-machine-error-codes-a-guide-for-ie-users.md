## Solving Error Codes on LG Washing Machines
If you have an LG washing machine and have been presented with an error code, then this guide is for you. This article will walk you through how to diagnose and potentially fix common error codes on LG washing machines. 

Often times when an error code is displayed on an LG washing machine, the problem can be fixed with a few simple steps. First, try unplugging the washing machine from the wall, wait 15 minutes and then plug it back in. If this does not solve the problem, then refer to LG’s comprehensive error codes glossary to further identify the problem. If you still can’t identify the source of the problem, it may be necessary to contact an LG repair technician.

Once you have identified the error code, you can use LG’s error codes guide to identify the issue caused by the code and potential solutions. For example, if your LG washing machine is indicating an FE error code, this could indicate that the water has become too hot. To fix this issue, reduce the temperature of your hot water before starting a new cycle.

LG has also put together comprehensive instructions on how to reset LG washing machines, which can be used to manually reset the machine and clear the error code. This is helpful if the code persists even after you have tried to troubleshoot the issue.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to identify, troubleshoot and potentially fix common error codes on LG washing machines. If the issue persists, however, it may be necessary to contact an LG repair technician for further assistance.
