## Getting to Know 7 Common Code Error Messages 

It can be frustrating when you go to use a household appliance only to discover it has an error message displayed on the screen. It can be harder still if you have no idea what the code means. Luckily, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) will help you understand the seven most common code error messages that you are likely to come across. 

The first code error message you will likely encounter is E1. This is an indication that the appliance has experienced a problem with one of its sensors or detectors. It could be that the appliance is malfunctioning due to a faulty wire or a problem with the wiring itself. 

Another common code error message is E2. This means that the appliance is not heating up as it should be. This could be because the appliance's internal temperature sensors are not working correctly or there is a problem with the wiring system. It could also be caused by a blocked ventilation duct. 

Error code E3 is an indication that the appliance's motor has stopped working. This can be caused by a faulty motor or a problem with the appliance's wiring system. It could also mean that the motor is not getting the necessary power it needs to operate properly. 

Error code E4 indicates that the appliance has experienced a power surge. This can be caused by a faulty plug or circuit. It is important to check the wiring of the appliance as well as the wall outlet to see if the power source is stable and there are no issues with the wiring. 

Error code E5 means there is an issue with the appliance's thermostat. This could be an indication that the appliance's parts are not getting the proper power they need to function properly. It could also mean that the thermostat is not regulating the appliance's temperature correctly. 

Error code E6 is an indication that the appliance has experienced an issue with its internal circuit board. This could be due to a faulty wire or a problem with the appliance's wiring system. It could mean that the circuit board is not getting the necessary power it needs to operate properly. 

The last code error message to be aware of is E7. This is an indication that the appliance is not getting the power it needs to function properly. This could be because the power source is not supplying a consistent amount of power or because the wiring system is faulty. 

By understanding these seven common code error messages, you can quickly identify the potential causes of the problem and take steps to repair it.
