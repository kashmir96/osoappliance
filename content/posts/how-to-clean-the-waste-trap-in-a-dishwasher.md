If you’ve noticed that your dishwasher is not draining properly, it could be due to a clogged waste trap. Fortunately, it’s easy to clean the waste trap in a dishwasher and get your dishwasher running properly again. Here’s how to do it:

1. Unplug the dishwasher. Before you begin, make sure the dishwasher is unplugged from the wall.

2. Locate the waste trap. The waste trap is usually located underneath the dishwasher, near the bottom of the unit.

3. Remove the waste trap. Use a wrench to unscrew the waste trap and set it aside.

4. Clean out the waste trap. Use a brush to remove any debris or build-up from the waste trap.

5. Rinse the waste trap. Rinse the waste trap with warm water to ensure all debris is removed.

6. Reinstall the waste trap. Put the waste trap back in place and use the wrench to screw it in securely.

7. Plug the dishwasher back in. Once the waste trap is reinstalled, plug the dishwasher back in and turn it on to see if it’s draining properly.

Cleaning the waste trap in a dishwasher is a simple process that can help ensure your dishwasher is running properly. If you’re still having trouble with your dishwasher, contact a professional for assistance.
