## Uncovering the Cause of E4 Error Codes on Home Appliances
An E4 error code on your household appliance can be a daunting experience. Suddenly discovering the malfunction of your appliance and without the clue of what the issue is can be overwhelming. Fortunately, understanding the cause of the E4 error code is not as difficult as it may seem. 

The most common culprit of an E4 error code is a faulty thermal fuse. This is a safety feature within the appliance that trips when the temperature gets too high. When this fuse trips, the appliance will shut down to prevent any further damage. Resetting the thermal fuse will need to be done to get the appliance back up and running. 

Another possible cause of the E4 error code is a malfunctioning motor or a damaged motor carbon brush. Motors play a critical role in virtually all appliances, from washing machines to refrigerators. When these components break or become damaged, the E4 error code will display. In this case, a new motor will need to be installed or the existing motor needs to be repaired. 

Lastly, a common cause of the E4 error code is a faulty motherboard. The motherboard is the “brain” of the appliance and, without this component, all the components fail to work in tandem, leading to malfunctions and displays of error codes. Fortunately, repairing or replacing a motherboard is usually easy and relatively inexpensive.

No matter the cause of the E4 error code, it is important to call in a professional appliance repair technician to diagnose and repair the appliance. As soon as the E4 error code pops up, turn the appliance off and contact an experienced technician such as one of the professionals listed in our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians). Doing so will ensure that your appliance is fixed correctly and quickly, preventing further damage and ensuring your safety.
