Cleaning your oven is an important task to maintain the appliance and keep it running efficiently. With a few simple steps and some elbow grease, you can easily clean your oven and keep it looking like new.

Step 1: Remove the racks and knobs

Before you begin cleaning, remove all the racks and knobs from your oven. This will make it easier to get into all the nooks and crannies of your oven. Place the racks in a sink filled with hot, soapy water to soak while you clean the oven.

Step 2: Vacuum out any debris

Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any debris or crumbs from inside the oven. This will help ensure that all dirt is removed before you begin cleaning with soap and water.

Step 3: Make a paste of baking soda and water

Mix together baking soda and water to create a thick paste. Spread this paste over the entire inside of your oven, including walls, door, floor, and ceiling. Let it sit for at least an hour before proceeding to the next step. 

Step 4: Scrub off the paste with a sponge 
Using a damp sponge or cloth, scrub off the baking soda paste from inside your oven. Be sure to get into all corners and crevices for a thorough clean. Pay special attention to areas that are heavily soiled or stained as these may require more scrubbing than others. 

Step 5: Rinse off any remaining residue 
Once youâ€™ve finished scrubbing off the baking soda paste, use a damp cloth or sponge to rinse off any remaining residue from inside your oven. Be sure to dry thoroughly before replacing racks and knobs back in place. 

 Step 6: Clean exterior surfaces 
Finally, use an all-purpose cleaner or stainless steel cleaner on exterior surfaces such as knobs, handles, door frame, etc., for a sparkling finish on your oven!

In conclusion, cleaning your oven is a simple task that can help keep your appliance running smoothly and looking its best. With these easy steps, you can easily clean your oven and have it looking like new in no time!
