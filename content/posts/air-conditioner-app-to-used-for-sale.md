Are you looking for a way to sell your used air conditioners? Look no further than online marketplaces such as eBay, Trade Me, and Facebook Marketplace. These apps provide an easy and convenient way to list your air conditioners for sale and make sure they get seen by potential buyers. 

Ebay is a popular auction site that allows you to list items for sale at a starting price of your choice. Buyers can then bid on the item until the auction ends, with the highest bidder being awarded the item. This allows you to set a competitive starting price for your air conditioner that will ensure it sells quickly and for a good price. 

Trade Me is one of New Zealand’s biggest online marketplaces, offering sellers the chance to list their items in categories such as ‘Air Conditioning’. You can choose to set a fixed price or use an auction format like eBay if you prefer, giving buyers more options when it comes to purchasing items from you. 

Facebook Marketplace is also available in New Zealand and provides an easy way for people to buy and sell goods locally. It can be used by individuals or businesses alike, allowing them access to millions of potential buyers with just one listing. You have complete control over pricing and shipping arrangements, making it easy for both buyers and sellers alike. 

These apps are incredibly useful when it comes to selling your used air conditioners online - so why not give them a go? With their wide reach and simple listing formats, they are sure to help you find the perfect buyer in no time!
