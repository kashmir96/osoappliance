Are you having problems with your washing machine not taking water? You’re not alone. This is one of the most common issues that people experience when their washing machine isn’t working properly. Fortunately, it’s usually a simple fix and doesn’t require calling in an appliance repair serviceman right away. Before you contact one of our directory appliance repair servicemen, here are a few things to check to make sure your washing machine is getting the water it needs:

1. Check the Water Supply and Hoses - Make sure that both the cold and hot water supply hoses are connected to your washer correctly, and that there are no kinks or clogs blocking them. If need be, replace these hoses if they have worn out or been damaged in some way. 

2. Check the Water Inlet Valve - The water inlet valve on a washing machine controls how much water gets into the wash tub during a cycle. If this valve isn't functioning properly, it can cause your washer to not take in any water at all or only take in small amounts at a time. To check this valve, unplug the electrical connection from its terminal on the back of your washer and use an ohm meter to ensure there is no power going through it before checking further for any issues with its components or wiring harnesses connected to it . If needed replace this part with an exact replacement part from an appliance store near you so as not to void warranty on motorized parts such as this one given by most manufacturers such as Samsung/LG/GE Appliances etc 
	 
3. Check Your Shutoff Valves - The shutoff valves located under sinks (or other places) may be turned off completely or become partially blocked due to buildup of minerals over time leading them not allowing full flow of incoming water pressure which will lead directly into decreased flow into washers overall resulting in “no fill errors” occurring more often than desired . To check these valves , shut off all incoming electricity/power going into unit then turn knob counterclockwise fully until hearing a click noise coming from inside walls indicating full open position allowing maximum amount potential pressure entering unit once again upon next cycle start up . Also while performing this inspection note any corrosion present following removal of knobs which will require immediate professional help if seen prior re-installation & should always be done by certified technicians who knows exact safety protocols when dealing w/ electrically charged live wires which can lead directly into fatal accidents if handled improperly 

Following these steps should help diagnose why your washing machine isn’t taking enough (or any)water during its cycles , but if none of these solutions work for you then maybe its time for contacting one of our expert appliance repair servicemen listed within our directory who may be able provide more assistance regarding current issue at hand !
