Cooking up delicious meals is a great way to bring the family together, but it’s important to remember that keeping your stove top clean is an essential part of kitchen hygiene. If your stove top is covered in grime and grease, it can not only affect the taste of your food but also be a health hazard. To ensure that your cooking experience is pleasant and safe, here are some tips on how to clean your stove top. 

First, you need to gather the necessary cleaning supplies. Depending on the type of stove you have, you may need different materials. For electric stoves with smooth glass tops, you will need: dish soap, water, sponge or cloths for wiping down surfaces, and glass cleaner for removing streaks and smudges. For gas stoves with drip pans and burner grates, you will need: warm water, baking soda or other degreaser products specifically designed for cleaning stoves (like Easy Off Oven Cleaner), a brush for scrubbing off hard-to-remove grime from drip pans and burner grates, a cloth or sponge for wiping down surfaces. 

Once you have all of your supplies ready to go, turn off the stovetop completely before beginning any cleaning process. Then use hot soapy water or degreaser product to scrub away any food residue from the burners and drip pans/grates. Let this sit while you wipe down all surfaces with a damp cloth or sponge and soap solution - use circular motions to ensure all spots are reached - then rinse away with clean water. For electric stoves with glass tops use glass cleaner after wiping down surfaces with soap solution in order to remove any streaks or smudges left behind by food particles; wipe dry afterwards with a soft cloth or paper towel. 

Finally make sure all surfaces are dry before turning on the stove again - this will help avoid electrical shock! And there you have it - now your stove top should be looking sparklingly clean! Regular maintenance like this will help keep it in tip-top condition for years to come!
