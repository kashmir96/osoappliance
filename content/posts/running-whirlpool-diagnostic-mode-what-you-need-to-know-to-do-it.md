## Understanding Running Whirlpool Diagnostic Mode
Whether your Whirlpool appliance is experiencing problems or you're doing a general inspection and maintenance check, running its diagnostic mode can help you find and solve the issue quickly. Knowing how to do this yourself can save time and money from expensive repair or service fees.

Diagnostic mode gives you access to unique codes that inform you of the current state of the appliance, identify potential problems and provide possible solutions. Knowing how to run this test and interpret the results, you can take the necessary steps to either troubleshoot or prevent potential problems.

The process for running diagnostic mode differs between models, and may vary with age and type of appliance, although all have the same purpose. Newer models have an electronic control panel where you can enter codes and select options, while older models come with a button or a set of switches to starts diagnostics. 

When you start the diagnostic mode, the first thing the machine will usually do is analyze the internal data and give you an error code. This error code is a combination of numbers that can be read by a technician to identify the problem. Unfortunately, a standard error code may not tell you what to do in order to fix the problem. That’s why it’s best to have the help of a technician to explain what the code means and how to apply the necessary fix. 

Once the code has been read, the machine can then run tests on the different parts of an appliance to identify how they’re running. This can be helpful in finding out how to better maintain your appliance and diagnose any issues. To properly interpret the results, it is best to have the help of an appliance expert.
