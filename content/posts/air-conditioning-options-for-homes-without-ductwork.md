If you live in an older home that doesn’t have ductwork, you may be wondering what your air conditioning options are. The good news is that there are several different ways to cool a home without ducts. Here are some of the best air conditioning options for homes without ductwork. 

1. Window Air Conditioner: Window air conditioners are probably the most common and cost-effective option for cooling a home without ducts. These units typically fit into a window sill and can be used to cool one or multiple rooms. They’re easy to install and operate, making them a great choice for those on a budget. 

2. Portable Air Conditioner: Portable air conditioners are similar to window units but they don’t require any permanent installation. They come on wheels so they can be moved from room to room as needed, which makes them ideal for renters or those with limited space in their homes. 

3. Ductless Mini Split System: A ductless mini split system is slightly more expensive than other options but it offers the most efficient cooling solution for homes without ducts. These systems consist of an outdoor condenser unit and one or more indoor air handlers which can be mounted directly onto walls or ceilings in individual rooms or zones throughout the house, allowing you to customize the climate control in each space as needed. 

4. Radiant Cooling System: Radiant cooling systems are another great option for homeowners who don’t have access to traditional air conditioning systems with ducts but want something more efficient than window units or portable ACs . These systems use water-filled tubes installed underneath floors or behind walls/ceilings to provide comfortable temperatures throughout your entire home while using less energy than conventional HVAC systems with ducts do . 

No matter what type of home you have, there is an air conditioning system out there that will work best for your needs and budget! If you need help deciding which system is right for you, contact a local HVAC professional who can evaluate your situation and recommend the best solution for your specific needs .
