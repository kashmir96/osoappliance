## Understanding the E4 Error for Your Washing Machine
The dreaded error message: E4. This code shows up on many types of washing machines and can be a frustrating error to fix on your own. Fortunately, understanding the E4 error and why it occurs allows you to take the proper steps in order to fix the issue. 

The E4 error on your washing machine usually indicates a problem with draining water from the machine. This could mean that the water is not being drained properly or at all. Often, the cause of this is a clogged pipe or pump or even an electrical issue. It is important to first inspect the drain hose, filter, and pump, which can all be found behind the washing machine.

To start your troubleshooting, unplug the power and disconnect the water supply. Take out the filter and hose and check for any blockage, as well as inspect the pump and its connections. If your washing machine has a reset button, press it before plugging the power and checking the water supply again. If the drain hose is clogged and needs to be replaced, make sure to get a new one with the correct specifications for your machine. 

In addition, there are certain electrical components in your washing machine that must be tested before attempting a repair. This includes checking connections, the control module, and other wiring to ensure they are functioning properly. If the wiring is damaged, then a qualified technician should be contacted to repair the issue.
