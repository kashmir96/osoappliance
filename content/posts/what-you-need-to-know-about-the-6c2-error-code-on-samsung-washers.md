## Dealing with the 6c2 Error Code on Samsung Washers

When owning a Samsung washer, it is important to understand the various error codes that you might encounter, including what they mean and what to do to fix them. One of these codes is the 6c2 error code and this article will address common questions and concerns related to it. 

When you encounter the 6c2 error code on your Samsung washer, it denotes a Motor Overload Error. In most cases, this indicates that the washer either does not have enough space or the load is too heavy for the drum to handle. If your washer has enough space, it is likely that the load is too large. In order to resolve this issue, you will need to transfer some of the clothes to a smaller amount that the drum is able to handle.

If the 6c2 error code persists after reducing the size of the load, it is likely that the issue is related to a problem with the motor itself. In this case, you will likely need to contact a technician to repair the issue. It is important to note that attempting to repair the issue on your own can be unsafe and may result in further damage to the machine. 

If you experience the 6c2 error code on your Samsung washer, it is important to attempt to reduce the size of the load first and only contact a technician for assistance if the issue persists. Any DIY repairs can be potentially dangerous and result in further damage to the machine.
