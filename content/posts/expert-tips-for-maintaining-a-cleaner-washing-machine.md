## Tips for Cleaning and Maintaining a Washing Machine
It is essential to regularly maintain and clean your washing machine if you want to extend its lifespan and keep it running efficiently. To do so, you must stay on top of preventive maintenance and perform deep cleanings of the machine and should be done regularly. Here are expert tips for keeping your washing machine clean and running like new.

### Use a Cleanser 
Using a washing machine cleanser is a great way to keep the appliance clean. If you've noticed an unpleasant odor, use a specific washing machine cleanser to eliminate the bad odor. Follow the instructions on the package for the proper usage, and clean according to the manufacturer's specifications.

### Clean the Tub
After each cycle, use a damp cloth to wipe down the inside of the tub and the rubber seal that covers the door. Make sure to remove any lint or dirt with a small brush. Clean the inside of the lid and around the edges of the door.

### Sanitize the Inside
Sanitizing the inside of the machine is an important step in washing machine maintenance. You can use either a store-bought washing machine cleaner or an at-home solution of water and bleach. Use a cup to pour the solution into the bowl and then run a regular cycle. This will help to remove any hidden or lingering bacteria that are in the machine.

### Clean out the Detergent Dispenser 
The detergent dispenser should be rinsed out with hot, soapy water every few weeks. This will help to prevent bacteria, mold, and mildew from building up. After each cycle, make sure to empty the drawer and inspect it for any clogs or blocks.

### Flush out the Hoses
It's important to flush out the hoses of your washing machine once a year. This can help to prevent clogs and build up in the hoses, which could lead to water damage. Disconnect the hot and cold water hoses from the washer, pour a cup of white vinegar into both hoses, and then run for about a minute before reconnecting them.

By taking a few simple steps such as using a cleanser and flushing out the hoses, you can ensure that your washing machine will remain clean and running like new for years to come. If you're ever in need of further maintenance or repair for your washing machine, you can easily and conveniently find a [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) with the provided link.
