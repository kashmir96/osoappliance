## Shopping for Refurbished Appliances at Lowes
When considering a new purchase of a major household appliance, one viable option is to purchase a quality refurbished model at Lowe's. Refurbished appliances are products that are pre-owned and fixed up to offer a like-new or close-to-new experience to the consumer at a lower cost than buying a new model. The repair process involves professional teams who ensure top-notch quality by thoroughly testing and restoring the appliance to its original performance, if not better. 

Though several stores offer great prices on refurbished appliances, Lowes has a special selection of pre-owned products which they call "Open Box" or "Bench Tested." In order to qualify for these, the appliance must pass a rigorous set of tests following the repair process before being cleared for sale, so you can rest easy knowing that the item you are purchasing is reliable and meets the highest standards. Plus you'll often find appliances with more desirable features, such as quieter motors and additional settings, and all for up to 30% off the price that you would have paid for a new model.

Not only does Lowes have a great selection of refurbished appliances, but the store also provides lots of helpful services and resources to make the process of purchasing and using the product easier. This includes free delivery and disposal options, free appliance diagnostics, free layaway plans and financing offers on select products, as well as extended warranties and protection plans in case of any future damage or issues. With all this combined, you can be sure to find the right appliance for your home, right at Lowes. 

When looking to upgrade or purchase an appliance for your home, shopping refurbished at Lowes is an excellent choice. You can find great deals on reliable products and lots of helpful services to make the process easier. Plus, the savings you receive can be put towards other items, such as an extended warranty or a quality appliance repair provider.
