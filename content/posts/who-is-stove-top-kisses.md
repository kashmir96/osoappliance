Stove Top Kisses are a delicious and easy to make treat that can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike. The ingredients are simple, but the end result is a sweet and savory snack that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. 

Stove Top Kisses are made with just two ingredients: marshmallows and butter. First, the butter is melted in a skillet over medium heat. Then, the marshmallows are added to the skillet and stirred until they’re completely melted. Once this is done, the mixture is spooned onto parchment paper or wax paper in small mounds. The mounds are then left to cool until they’re firm enough to handle before they’re rolled into balls. 

These little treats can be enjoyed as-is, or they can be given an extra layer of sweetness by being dipped in melted chocolate. They’re also great for decorating cakes, cupcakes, and other desserts. Stove Top Kisses can even be used as an ingredient in other recipes like s'mores bars or cookie bars. 

Stove Top Kisses are a great way to add a bit of fun to any dessert or snack. They’re easy to make and require minimal ingredients, making them perfect for those who don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen but still want to enjoy something sweet. So grab some marshmallows and butter and give Stove Top Kisses a try!
