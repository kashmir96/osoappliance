## Understanding the Most Common Dishwasher Problems 

With dishwashers designed to take on the hassle of washing dishes, they are an essential asset in any kitchen. Its always best to know what kind of problems you may potentially be dealing with when it comes to a dishwasher. Knowing the most common dishwasher problems and how to address them can help you maintain your appliance and keep it running smoothly for years to come.

### Water Leaks

Water leaks are one of the most common issues with dishwashers. Common signs that you may have a water leak include puddles of water around appliance, wet floors and cupboards, and the smell of musty odors in and around the appliance. To begin addressing the issue, ensure that the water supply to the dishwasher is shut off. Carefully inspect all levels of the dishwasher, such as the hoses and seals, and repair any dripping or loose connections.

### Draining Errors

Draining and filling errors are also common in dishwashers. Poor draining and filling result in lackluster washing performance and water that has not been adequately drained from the machine. Poor draining is generally attributed to clogged filters, drain blockages and damaged pumps. You'll probably need to inspect the filters for clogs, then repair and replace the necessary parts. You may also need to check the drain hose and ensure that it is connected properly and isnâ€™t clogged.

### Detergent Dispenser Problems

Every once in a while, a dishwasher's detergent dispenser may malfunction. Generally, this is caused by a build-up of detergent or other debris in the dispenser cavity. To troubleshoot and fix this, you should thoroughly clean the dishwasher's detergent dispenser, removing all debris and detergent residue. If the dispenser still isn't operating correctly, you may need to replace it with a new part.

Maintaining a dishwasher can help to prevent future repair issues and keep it running optimally.
