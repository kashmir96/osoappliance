## Fixing the Annoying GE Washer Error Code 8e
It can be really frustrating when a household appliance stops working with no obvious explanation. When it comes to your GE washer, this can happen when the code 8e is flashed up. But there's no need to despair, as this code is actually easily fixed and quite harmless.

Error code 8e is a communication error between the washer and the display control. It often occurs when water isn't draining correctly or when there's a disruption in the electrical current. To resolve the issue, it's often necessary to take the following steps:

- Clean the filter located in the bottom of the machine, ensuring the filter isn't blocked.
- Inspect the drain hose for any twist or kinks that could be hindering water drainage.
- Check the water level pressure switch hose for a kink or any type of obstruction. 
- Check the air pressure switch hose for any kinks or blockages.
- Make sure that the power cord is connected correctly.
- Check the drain pump for any blockages.

More often than not, one of these steps should resolve the code 8e issue. However, if the problem persists, it is possible that your washer may require service.

Although the appearance of error code 8e can seem initially frightening, it is really quite harmless. Utilizing the steps listed above should help you return your washer to its normal functions. If you're still having difficulties, it may be an ideal time to consult our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/), which outlines the potential causes of error codes and how to fix them.
