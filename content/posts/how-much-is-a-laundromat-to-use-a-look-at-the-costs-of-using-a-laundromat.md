## How Much is a Laundromat to Use?
Are you looking for an affordable way to do laundry? A laundromat may be the perfect solution. But, before you commit to this option, it pays to know what it will cost. In this blog, we’ll take a look at the typical costs associated with using a laundromat. 

The first and most obvious cost when using a laundromat are the machines themselves. Most laundromats charge by the load or by time on each machine. Usually machines charge between $1-$2 per load and offer various sizes ranging from small (10-15 lbs) up to extra large (35-40 lbs). Some of these larger washers can even accommodate two loads at once! 

In addition to the machine costs, there may also be other fees associated with your use of a laundromat. These can include detergent fees if you choose not to bring your own cleaning supplies and possibly dryer sheets as well. Some locations even charge for folding services if you need help getting your clothes back into their proper shape after drying them in one of their machines! 

Finally, some locations may also require that users purchase tokens or coins in order to access their services. This is common if they don't accept traditional forms of payment such as credit cards or cash – so make sure you come prepared with enough money when visiting one of these coin-operated establishments! 

Using a laundromat can be an economical way to keep your clothes clean without breaking the bank – but only if you know all the associated costs beforehand! Before deciding whether it’s worth it for you or not, make sure that all fees are accounted for so that there are no unpleasant surprises when trying out this budget-friendly option for doing laundry!
