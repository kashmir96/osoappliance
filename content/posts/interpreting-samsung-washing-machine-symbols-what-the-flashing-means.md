## Decoding Samsung Washing Machine Symbols - What Flashing Lights Indicate

A Samsung washing machine is a powerful appliance but occasionally you may see flashing or blinking lights which can be confusing. Before making a service call, it may be beneficial to understand exactly what the symbols your washing machine is displaying mean. There are many symbols on Samsung washing machines that can help you to diagnose problems. 

You'll find labels inside the door and also on the detergent tray, each featuring various symbols and lights. Some of these represent modes, some of them indicate when the washer is working correctly, and some of them indicate that there is an issue. It's useful to know what all the symbols mean so you can interpret the flashing lights accurately. 

The most common lights that appear are those representing Spin and Rinse. If the washing machine is starting a cycle, the Spin light will come on when the water is being pumped out, and the Rinse light will illuminate when it's time for the clothes to be rinsed. This is also the time when the machine will sound a long beep.

The other lights that are commonly seen are the Power, Pre-wash and Delay lights. The Power light will come on when the washer is plugged in, the Pre-wash light will flash when a pre-wash cycle has been selected, and the Delay light will come on if the wash cycle has been delayed. If a different mode is selected, the light associated with that mode will come on.

If you notice the washing machine making a noise or the LED display is alternating between the blinking mode and a different mode, it can mean a fault with the motor, the pressure switch, or the water level switch. These are potentially serious and should be addressed by a qualified technician. 

You may also find more symbols on your washing machine, like Wash, Dry and Clean, among others - all of which have their own meanings.
