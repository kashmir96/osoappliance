# How to repair Bosch motor brushes

Bosch is one of the most popular washing machine brands in New Zealand, the machines tend to be quite durable and last many years, however if your Bosch washing machine won't spin or is throwing an error, the first thing people should check and replace are the motor brushes (other than searching the error code in google). Replacing Bosch motor brushes is quite cheap and a quick process, in this article we'll explain the process. 

If you own a Bosch washing machine with brushes in the motor, you may find yourself needing to repair the motor brushes from time to time. Motor brushes are an important part of the motor, as they are responsible for transferring electrical current from the motor to the commutator. Over time, these brushes can wear out and need to be replaced. Fortunately, replacing the motor brushes on a Bosch motor is a relatively simple process.

The first step in repairing your Bosch motor brushes is to remove the motor from its housing. This can be done by unscrewing the screws that hold the motor in place. Once the motor is removed, you will need to locate the motor brushes. These are typically located near the commutator.

Once you have located the motor brushes, you will need to remove them. This can be done by gently prying them out of the motor with a flathead screwdriver. Once the brushes are removed, you can inspect them for signs of wear. If the brushes are shorter than a centimetre or so, they are likely worn out and will need to be replaced.

Next, you will need to install your new motor brushes. These can be found at hardware stores or online on websites like AliExpress, eBay, TradeMe or Amazon. Once you have the new brushes, you will need to install them. This can be done by inserting the brushes into the motor and securing them by clipping the tabs back into the motor brush housing. Some washing machines require a couple screws to keep these in place, but generally Bosch washing machines only require the clips. 

Finally, you will need to reassemble the motor and reinstall it into its housing. Once the motor is back in place, you can test it to make sure that the new brushes are working properly. You may need to reset the control panel if you have an error code stopping it from working, search how to do this for your specific model number (found inside the door on a small sticker or on the back of the machine).

Replacing the motor brushes on a Bosch washing machine is a relatively simple process. With the right tools and a bit of patience, you can easily replace your Bosch motor brushes and get your machine running like new again.
