## How Much Do Laundromats Make? 

Laundromats can be a profitable business for entrepreneurs, but how much do they actually make? It turns out that the answer depends on a variety of factors such as location, size of the business, and types of services offered. 

The most common revenue sources for laundromat businesses are coin-operated machines and ancillary services like soap sales, dry cleaning services, laundry pick-up and delivery. Coin-operated machines typically have a gross profit margin in the range of 25%-35% before expenses. Ancillary services tend to have higher gross profit margins but also require additional labor costs. The cost of goods or materials sold is typically low compared to other industries making it easier to generate profits even with tight margins. 

Location is also an important factor when it comes to profitability because it affects foot traffic and thus sales volume. A laundromat located in a densely populated area will likely generate more revenue than one located in a rural area with fewer people living nearby. Additionally, some locations may offer incentives such as free parking or discounted rates which could increase profits further if utilized effectively by marketing campaigns or promotions. 

Overall, many laundromats are able to generate healthy profits despite intense competition from large chains as well as local businesses offering similar services at lower prices due to their size advantages and economies of scale benefits from bulk purchasing power and other resources not readily accessible by smaller operations like mom & pop laundries. Even so, due diligence should always be exercised when considering starting such a venture since there are numerous factors that could affect its success or failure over time including maintenance costs associated with upkeep on washing machines & dryers which can become expensive quickly if not regularly serviced properly - making routine appliance repairs here necessary for any successful small business owner looking to stay ahead financially!
