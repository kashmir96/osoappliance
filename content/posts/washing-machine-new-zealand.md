If you live in New Zealand and you're looking to upgrade your washing machine, you've come to the right place. With so many options and features available, it can be difficult to decide which one is right for you. Here are a few things to consider when shopping for a new washing machine in New Zealand.

Energy Efficiency: One of the most important factors when selecting a new washing machine in New Zealand is energy efficiency. Look for models with an Energy Rating of 6 or higher, which indicates that they use less electricity than other models. You'll also want to make sure that the model has an "A" rating on water consumption, as this will help reduce your water bill too.

Warranties & Repairs: It's important that any washing machine you purchase comes with a good warranty and repair policy - especially if it's expensive or has more technological features. Make sure that your chosen model comes with at least one year's cover for parts and labour - this will give you peace of mind should something go wrong during the first year of ownership.

Size & Capacity: Consider how much laundry your household does on average before deciding on which model to buy - this will determine both the size of washer needed as well as its capacity (how much laundry it can fit). If space is limited then there are slimline models available too, although their capacity may be slightly lower than other models due to their smaller size. 

Noise Level: Washing machines can be quite noisy during spin cycles so make sure to check out the sound levels before purchasing one - look out for machines featuring noise reduction technology such as inverter motors, which are designed to reduce noise levels by up to 50%. 

Price Range: Finally, don't forget about price! Before making any decisions compare different quotes online and see what kind of deals are available - remember that cheaper doesn't always mean better though so make sure quality isn't compromised for price tag savings! 
 
Hopefully these tips have given you some insight into what makes a good washing machine in New Zealand! Take your time when researching different models and make sure all aspects from energy efficiency through to warranties are considered before making any buying decisions
