## Troubleshooting Your Robot Vacuum Cleaner

Robotic vacuum cleaners offer a convenient and often effortless way to keep your floors clean and tidy. But, like all home appliances, they occasionally suffer from technical issues. Here are a few tips to help solve those robot vacuum issues.

First and foremost, check for any blocked airways or objects that may be blocking the power switch or the power socket. See is there is any debris or dirt stuck in the brush. Remove it and run the vacuum again.

Next, make sure the power source is not the problem. If you are using a wall plug, check if the socket is live. Change the plug and see if that fixes it. If it’s battery operated, make sure the batteries are fully charged and re-inserting them.
