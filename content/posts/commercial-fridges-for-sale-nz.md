Are you looking for a reliable and efficient commercial fridge for your business in New Zealand? If so, here is an overview of the different types of commercial fridges available for sale in New Zealand. 

The first type of commercial fridge that you may want to consider is an upright refrigerator. These refrigerators offer a large storage capacity and can range from single door models to large three-door units. Upright models are ideal for busy kitchens as they provide efficient cooling and easy access to food items. They can also be used as food preparation areas with the addition of shelves or drawers. 

Undercounter fridges are also popular in NZ businesses, offering a sleek design and easy installation. These units come in single door or multiple door configurations, depending on your needs, and take up minimal space while providing ample storage capacity. Many undercounter refrigerators feature adjustable temperature controls for precise cooling control, as well as auto defrost capabilities to ensure maximum efficiency in operation. 

Glass fronted display cabinets are another popular option when it comes to commercial fridges NZ businesses use today. These cabinets allow customers to view what is inside without having to open the door themselves, which saves time and energy when it comes time to serve customers quickly during peak hours. The glass fronted displays also give customers an attractive view into the products offered by your business - making them more likely to purchase from you! 

Finally, walk-in coolers are ideal solutions if you need larger storage capacities than those provided by standard models or if you require extra insulation against temperature fluctuations outside your store or restaurant premises
