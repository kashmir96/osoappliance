## The Emergence of Electrical Hair Dryers 

Electrical hair dryers have come a long way, reaching our homes and changing the way we style our hair and look. From harsh and unreliable unreliable air blowing machines to professional styling tools of today - discover the journey they have taken to make our haircare routines easier and more efficient. 

The humble electrical hair dryer was developed in the late 1800s. It was developed using a model of a vacuum cleaner and the first patent for a hand-held electrical dryer was filed in 1890. The first successful electrical hair dryers were presented at the world’s fair in 1904 and hit store shelves by 1915. 

The original model’s shape was bulky and inconvenient, yet it was deemed a revolutionary invention. As times changed and technology advanced, the design of the popular appliance was improved, with more affordable and lighter options becoming popular. 

For the first half of the 20th century, electrical hair dryers were corded and powered by harmless motors. Overtime, the blows they produced and the temperature they reached began to improve. Industrial dryers limited the power of household models intended for home-use, giving unwanted results like dry, brittle hair.

In the late 1960s, industrial-sized blow dryers were made available to the public. These dryers had more powerful motors, gave better results and put less stress on the hair. Today, electrical hair dryers come in a range of sizes, shapes, and designs. From the budget-friendly option to the high-end variety- there are plenty of choices to find that perfect one for you. 

Whether you’re looking for a simple, yet effective electrical hair dryer for everyday use, or an advanced and highly effective styling tool, you will undoubtedly find a model that suits your needs. 

Over the years, electrical hair dryers have become an essential part of our everyday lives. With the proper use of the newest hair tools available, we are able to style our hair within minutes with the most innovative technology.
