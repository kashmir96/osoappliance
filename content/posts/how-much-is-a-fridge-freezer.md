If you’re in the market for a new refrigerator/freezer, you may be wondering how much is a fridge freezer? The cost of fridge freezers can vary depending on size, features, and energy efficiency. 

Smaller models with basic features can range from $500 to $700 dollars. At the mid-range price point, you can find fridges with features like digital displays and temperature controls for between $1,000 and $2,500 dollars. Refrigerators that feature high-end materials like stainless steel or French doors may cost up to $4,000 or more. 

Energy efficiency also has an impact on price. Fridge freezers that are Energy Star certified tend to cost more upfront but will save you money in the long run by using less electricity over time. Additionally, keep in mind that if your kitchen doesn’t have built-in ventilation for your fridge freezer combo unit or needs additional electrical work done to accommodate it safely and properly then there may be additional installation costs associated with it as well. 

Overall there is quite a range when it comes to how much is a fridge freezer but with options available at varying prices points there’s something out there for everyone!
