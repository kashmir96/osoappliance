## A Look at the Average Lifespan of a Refrigerator

It seems like there’s no end to the things we need our refrigerators to do: from keeping food safe and cold to completing automated grocery orders. Understanding how long most refrigerators last is an important part of managing our household appliances.

Although much depends on how you use your fridge and other specific factors, the average life expectancy of a refrigerator is 13-18 years. It’s usually the compressor that gives out first, so if your refrigerator is older than 13 years and has been showing signs of decline such as taking longer to cool, making unusual noises, or having leaks, it may be time for a new one.

You should also be aware of the environmental costs of running an inefficient or old refrigerator. Models released after 2000 are much more energy-efficient than their predecessors and can keep your energy bills low.

When shopping for a new refrigerator, it’s important to focus on more than just the latest design.
