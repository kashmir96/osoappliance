## An In-Depth Look at Resolving a 45 Error Code 

It is inevitable – something eventually stops working within the home, whether it is a kitchen appliance, heating, or cooling system. Error codes on appliances can be confusing and complicated, yet are actually quite useful in helping troubleshoot solutions to many of the most common problems. The 45 error code, in particular, is a common one, but can be easily solved. This article provides a step-by-step look into what this error code means and how to resolve it. 

The ‘45’ error code is an indication that there is a problem with the thermostat (or thermistor). Simply put, the thermostat acts a ‘switch’ that turns the appliance on and off when needed. When this occurs, it usually throws an error code which is usually the number ‘45’. 

In order to resolve the issue, you will want to check the wiring and connections that the thermostat has to the appliance. Make sure that the wiring is properly secured and connected to the correct ports. Next, check that the power source itself is in proper working order. If none of these solutions work, then you likely need to replace the offending thermostat with a new one. 

After all the steps have been taken to properly repair the appliance, the problem should be resolved and you should be able to enjoy your appliance again. If you are still having issues, it is best to contact an experienced technician to further diagnose and fix the issue. 

Using an error code to diagnose a problem with any household appliance can be difficult and intimidating. While it’s often helpful to try to figure it out yourself, sometimes it’s best to seek professional help.
