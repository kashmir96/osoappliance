## Washing Machine Rattling No More - Here's What You Can Do

If you’re experiencing your washing machine rattling when spinning, you’re certainly not alone. The issue of a raucous laundry room is a common one, and usually all it takes is a few easy fixes to return your washing machine back to its silent state. 

One of the most common causes of a rattling washing machine is imbalanced loads. A washing machine has multiple rotors and springs which help move the water and redistribute your clothes as the machine runs through its cycles. If a load is not distributed evenly, the machine will eventually become unstable, resulting in a loud metallic clanging sound. To ensure the load is properly balanced, remember to arrange clothes in your washer before initiating the cycle, and add more clothes if necessary to avoid an uneven load.

In addition to loud noises, a broken suspension rod or suspension spring could be causing your washing machine to rattle. These rods are designed to aid with the balance of the system, and keep the motor stable when running throughout its cycle. If one of these fails, the drum may slump, becoming misaligned and causing excessive vibrations. To remedy this issue, the suspension rods and springs should be checked and replaced or re-tightened if necessary.

In some cases, even if the suspension rods and springs appear to be in good condition, they may still need to be replaced. Worn-out parts can diminish in stability with time and eventually require replacing due to the continued strain from moving loads. It is also possible to have too many items in the drum, as this can prevent proper movement. The door seal may also be to blame, as a weakened or damaged seal can cause the drum to vibrate more than usual.

If the noise persists despite your best efforts, it may be time to call in an expert in appliance repair. Taking it upon yourself to fix a potentially complex issue can be a daunting and intimidating prospect, so if it comes down to replacing parts or simply turning something off, you should always reach out to a qualified technician.

At the end of the day, if your washing machine is rattling when spinning, most of the time it’s a relatively simple knock-up job that you can fix yourself. However, it’s always important to be safe, not sorry. If you’re not comfortable with attempting something on your own, remember that our directory of professional appliance repair technicians is here to help you.
