The summer months are here, and with them comes the need to keep cool. If your home doesn’t have central air conditioning, you may be looking for an alternative way to beat the heat. Installing a window-mounted air conditioner can be a great solution for those who don’t want to invest in central air or window units that require professional installation. With a few simple steps, you can install your own window kit and be ready for the hot summer days ahead.

The first step in installing your window kit is to measure the opening of your window where you plan to install it. You will need this measurement when purchasing your kit from the store so you can ensure it will fit properly in your window. Once you have purchased the kit, read through all of the instructions before beginning installation. This will ensure that everything goes smoothly and that there are no surprises along the way. 

Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the instructions, begin by assembling all of the pieces as directed in the manual. Be sure to check each piece carefully as some may require additional tools or supplies that are not included in your kit. Once everything is assembled, place it into position within your window frame and secure it with any necessary screws or bolts provided with your kit. 

Next, attach any hoses or other accessories as directed by following instructions provided by either a manual or online video tutorial if available - this is important since each model varies slightly in how they should be connected and secured properly within your home environment. Once all parts are securely attached, test out how well they work by turning on power at both ends - typically via an outlet near your AC unit itself and also one near where power enters from outside into house wiring - then adjust any settings such as temperature control according to what works best for you! 

Lastly, if desired add insulation around edges of unit where necessary (e.g., weather stripping) to prevent cold drafts entering living space during winter months – this helps keep energy bills down while also providing better overall temperature comfort throughout year! With these few simple steps you can easily install a window-mounted air conditioner yourself – no professional installation required!
