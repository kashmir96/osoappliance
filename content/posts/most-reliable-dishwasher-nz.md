Having a reliable dishwasher is essential for keeping your kitchen clean and running smoothly. Dishwashers are a household essential, but not all models are created equal. In New Zealand, there are several dishwasher brands that offer reliable and efficient cleaning performance, making it easy to find the perfect model for your needs. 

Miele is one of the most popular brands in New Zealand when it comes to dishwashers. Their models offer superior energy efficiency with up to A+++ ratings, as well as powerful cleaning performance thanks to their specially designed 3D cutlery tray and AutoDos system that automatically dispenses detergent at the optimal time in each cycle. Miele dishwashers also come with a range of additional features such as delay start timers and adjustable racks for more flexible loading options. 

Another reliable brand in New Zealand is Bosch. Bosch dishwashers come with features such as AquaStop for total water protection against leakage and overflow, VarioSpeed Plus which allows you to reduce cycle times by up to 66%, and EcoSilence Drive motors that provide whisper-quiet operation while still delivering powerful washing results. Many Bosch models also come with additional accessories like extra cutlery baskets or top racks which can be used depending on your washing needs. 

Finally, Fisher & Paykel’s DishDrawer range offers compact designs that allow you to fit two drawers into the same space as one traditional dishwasher door – perfect if you have limited space available in your kitchen! Each drawer can be used separately or together depending on how many dishes need washing at any given time, plus they also feature SmartDrive technology for more efficient operation compared to conventional motors found in other brands of dishwashers. 

No matter what type of kitchen setup you have, there’s sure to be a reliable dishwasher model from one of these trusted New Zealand brands available for you!
