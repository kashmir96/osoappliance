When it comes to appliances, there are two types of parts: OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and non-OEM. Knowing the difference between the two is important when it comes to making sure you get the best quality and performance from your appliances.

OEM parts are those that are made by the original manufacturer of the appliance. They are designed to fit and work perfectly with the appliance and are often the most expensive option. OEM parts are usually the most reliable and offer the best performance.

Non-OEM parts are not made by the original manufacturer of the appliance. They are usually made by a third-party company and are usually cheaper than OEM parts. However, they are not always as reliable or as high quality as OEM parts.

When it comes to choosing between OEM and non-OEM parts for your appliances, it is important to consider the cost, quality, and performance of the parts. OEM parts are often more reliable and offer better performance, but they are also more expensive. Non-OEM parts are usually cheaper, but they may not be as reliable or as high quality as OEM parts. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide which option is best for your needs.
