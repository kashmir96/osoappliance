# How much does a 10kg washing machine fit

When it comes to washing machines, size does matter. Washing machines come in all shapes and sizes, so it's important to consider the size of your laundry room when selecting a new machine. A 10kg washing machine is a large capacity model that can handle larger loads of laundry. But how much space does it take up?

The size of a 10kg washing machine will vary depending on the make and model, but generally speaking they are around 70-80cm wide and 60-70cm deep. This means that they are typically around the same size as a standard fridge freezer, making them ideal for larger households or those who do lots of laundry.

When considering where to place the 10kg washing machine in your home, you will need to factor in both the width and depth of the machine as well as any other furniture or appliances nearby. You should also ensure that there is enough space for easy loading and unloading of clothes into the drum. If you're tight on space, you may want to consider an integrated or built-in model which can be installed directly into your kitchen cabinetry or bathroom wall for a neat finish.

Overall, a 10kg washing machine is an excellent choice for larger households who need to wash more clothes at once. With its large capacity drum and efficient cleaning power, it's sure to make light work of even the biggest loads of laundry!
