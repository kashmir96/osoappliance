# How to fix a washing machine

If you’ve ever experienced the frustration of dealing with a malfunctioning washing machine, you’re probably looking for answers on how to fix it. Although some repairs require the help of a qualified technician, many common issues can be addressed quickly and easily by following a few steps. Below are some steps to help you diagnose and fix a washing machine:

1. Check the power supply to your washing machine. Make sure the power cord is securely plugged into the wall socket and the appliance is switched on. If you have a power surge protector, make sure it’s in working condition.

2. Inspect the hose connecting the washing machine to the faucet. Make sure it is securely connected and no leaks are present.

3. If the machine is not draining properly, check the drain hose for kinks or clogs. If the machine is making a draining noise, make sure the pump filter is clean.

4. If the washing machine is not spinning, make sure the lid is closed securely. If the lid switch is damaged, it may need to be replaced.

5. If there is excessive noise, check the drum for items that may be obstructing it. If the noise persists, you may need to check the shock absorber for signs of wear.

6. If the machine is vibrating excessively, make sure the feet are level and the load is balanced.

7. If the timer is not advancing, check the timer knob to make sure it’s in the correct position.

8. If the cycle won’t start, make sure you’ve added the correct amount of detergent and check the water supply. Otherwise check the door is shutting properly, the door lock and inside the pump. 

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and fix a malfunctioning washing machine. If the problem persists, however, it’s best to call in a professional to help.
