## Creating a Safe Kitchen Environment with Required Range Hoods 

Cooking is an enjoyable and important part of everyday life that most of us take for granted. But it's important to remember that kitchen safety should be a major priority in any home. One of the key elements in creating a safe kitchen environment is making sure that your electric range hood meets all of the requirements. In this article, we'll provide some tips for making sure your kitchen is up to code with the help of electric range hoods.

First and foremost, electric range hoods should be properly installed. All electric range hoods should be mounted according to your manufacturer's guidelines and must meet local building codes. For example, a recirculating range hood must be elevated at least 18 inches above the cooking surface for proper operation. You should also check to make sure that any flexible duct is connected properly and that the blower fan is capable of proper ventilation.

Venting a range hood is also crucial for safety. Range hoods must be vented to the outside in order to be effective. Any range hood installed in a closed loop system (without being vented to the exterior) is not suitable for kitchen use as it fails to remove air pollutants, smoke, and moisture. The vent should extend up to a designated venting point and should be made with fire-resistant materials, such as UL-approved insulated metal duct.

Once your electric range hood is properly installed, don't forget to keep up with maintenance and cleaning. When used regularly, greasy deposits and debris can build up within your range hood and the ductwork. As this debris accumulates, it can impact the range hood's ability to perform properly and can create a safety hazard. Follow your manufacturer's instructions to clean and maintain your electric range hood.

In summary, an electric range hood is a vital appliance for a safe kitchen environment. In order to meet all of the electrical requirements, ensure that your range hood is properly installed and vented, as well as maintained and cleaned regularly.
