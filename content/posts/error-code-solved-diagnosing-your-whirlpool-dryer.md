## Troubleshooting Your Whirlpool Dryer with an Error Code
Are you trying to figure out what is wrong with your Whirlpool dryer due to an error code? If so, you can use the error code to diagnose the problem accurately and get your dryer fixed quickly. 

If you own a Whirlpool dryer, there are a variety of error codes you may come across during its lifetime that might appear when something is wrong with it. Error codes provide useful insight and information about the symptoms, making it easier for you to diagnose and repair your dryer.

Different types of Whirlpool dryers may display different error codes, making it important to consult your owner's manual or the specific error code to get the correct diagnosis. Generally, error codes will identify the part in the dryer that is causing the problem and may be accompanied by a letter and/or number.

Most Whirlpool dryers are equipped with warning lights similar to a car's “check engine” light. If this light is flashing, it signals that your dryer is malfunctioning or having a problem. When you turn the dryer off and then back on, the error code will display in the lights.

Once you determine the error code, there is generally a brief explanation in the owner's manual that will help you troubleshoot the issue. Or, you can use our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to search the full error code description and the potential repair steps.

If the error code does not appear to be a simple fix, it may be time to enlist the help of an experienced appliance repair technician. With the proper diagnosis from the error code and the technician's experience, you can be sure your dryer will be fixed as quickly and efficiently as possible.

No matter what type of Whirlpool dryer you are troubleshooting, getting a diagnosis from the error code is key to a fast resolution. So, be sure to use our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to help you diagnose and repair your Whirlpool Dryer quickly and safely.
