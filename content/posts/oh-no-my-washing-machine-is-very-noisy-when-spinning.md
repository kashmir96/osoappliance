## A Troubleshoot Guide for Unusually Loud Washing Machines

Are you having issues with your washing machine being unusually loud? If so, you’re not alone. This is a common problem and this blog provides helpful tips for troubleshooting your washing machine and lowering the volume. 

The most common causes for abnormally loud noises may include the following:

1. Damaged or shrunken rubber belt
2. Dish clogged with detergent
3. Incorrectly installed washer
4. Loose screws
5. Broken or worn-out bearings
 
The rubber belt of a washing machine is responsible for connecting the drum to the motor. This belt can become damaged or shrink over time, leading to a loud noise when in use. To eliminate this as the possible source of the noise, inspect the belt and replace if necessary. 

If the rubber belt is in good condition, consider the possibility of a dish clogged with detergent. This can cause the washer to work harder to churn and spin your clothes, resulting in increased vibrations and louder noises while it’s doing so. Check your washing machine's compartments and clean out any thick detergent buildup.

Incorrect installation of the washer can also lead to loud noises. If the washing machine is not balanced, it can cause vibrations. Check for any loose screws and tighten them. If the noise continues, consider the possibility of broken or worn-out bearings. If this is the issue, your best option is to call a service technician to examine and repair your machine.

It's important to keep in mind you must also regularly clean and care for your washing machine. Make sure to clean the filter in the washing machine every few weeks and check for any damage as this can sometimes cause loud noise.

In conclusion, if your washing machine is making a lot of noise, take the time to identify the source of the noise and take appropriate action. Consider the common causes listed in this blog and take the necessary steps to repair or replace the components causing the problem.
