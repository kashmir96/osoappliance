When it comes to appliance repair, it is important to understand the parts involved. Knowing the most common appliance repair parts can help you better diagnose and handle any issue that may come up. From ovens to refrigerators, here are some of the most common appliance repair parts that you should know about:

1. Motors: Motors are one of the most fundamental components in any type of appliance. They help power machines such as washing machines, dishwashers and air conditioners by providing rotational force to turn various objects within the appliance. If a motor malfunctions or needs replacement, it can be costly and time consuming.

2. Heating Elements: Heating elements are used in many appliances such as ovens, dryers and water heaters to generate heat for cooking or drying clothes. These elements can wear out over time due to high temperatures or voltage fluctuations causing them to malfunction or stop working altogether. 

3. Thermostats: Thermostats regulate temperatures in appliances such as fridges and freezers by controlling how much cold air is allowed into those devices at any given time. When these thermostats become faulty they need immediate attention as they can cause spoiled food items in refrigerators if not corrected quickly enough 

4. Switches: Switches are found on a variety of appliances from washers and dryers to microwaves and stoves; they're usually responsible for turning an appliance on/off or cycling through temperature settings, etc.. When these switches become worn over time due to constant use, they may need replacing which is relatively straightforward for an experienced technician but necessary nonetheless! 

5 Belts & Hoses: Belts and hoses are components found inside many types of appliances from vacuum cleaners all the way up through washing machines (and beyond). These belts keep vital components moving while hoses transfer liquids like water & steam between different sections of an appliance's interior workings - both need regular maintenance & replacement when they become worn out over time! 

Knowing what these common parts are can help you better diagnose what might be wrong with your appliance before calling a professional technician - saving you some money down the line! For major repairs however it's always best practice to call a professional so that your warranty remains intact & any potential safety concerns can be addressed properly!
