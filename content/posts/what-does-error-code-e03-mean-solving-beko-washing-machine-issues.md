## Understanding Error Code E03 on Beko Washing Machines

If you’re a Beko washing machine user, chances are you may come across the error code E03. This can be a frustrating problem, but there are solutions to fix this error code. Let’s learn what the E03 error code means, the possible underlying causes and the solutions to fix this problem.

Error code E03 indicates a water drainage error. When you power on the washing machine, if you receive the E03 code, it means the washer has encountered a fault that is causing the washer to not drain the water from the drum. In some cases, you may also see the E03 code appear along with another error code such as E12, E13 or E14 which indicate the issue is related to the water levels.

The most common cause of an E03 code on Beko washing machines is a blocked pump. The pump on a Beko washer can often become blocked or jammed with items such as buttons, coins, hair clips, paper clips, and similar objects. The pump could also become blocked with lint and dirt which can be an issue when washing items with high levels of dirt or lint such as bed linens and bath towels.

The solution to this problem is to clear the blockage and make sure the filter is clean and free of debris. To do this, simply turn off the washer, unplug the machine and remove the cover to access the filter. Be sure to wear disposable gloves and use a flashlight to see the filter clearly. Carefully remove any debris or objects that may be blocking the filter or pump and replace the filter if it is blocked.

Once the filter is cleared, you can plug the machine back in, turn it on and restart the cycle. If you still receive the E03 code, then there’s another underlying problem that needs to be addressed and your best bet is to contact a local appliance repair professional to diagnose and repair the issue.

If you ever come across an error code on your Beko washing machine, now you know what it might indicate and how to fix it. With this knowledge, you can save a lot of time and money on appliance repairs.
