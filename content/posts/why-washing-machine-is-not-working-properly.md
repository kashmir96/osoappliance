Most of us are familiar with the frustration of our washing machine not working properly. Before you contact an appliance repair technician, there are a few things that you should check to diagnose the problem and potentially fix it yourself. 

The first thing to do is to check that all components are securely in place and plugged in, as often faults can be caused by power disruption or loose parts. If everything looks okay here, then it’s time to look deeper into the issue. 

The next step is to see if anything is blocking or interfering with the movement of your machine’s drum and pulleys – sometimes items such as coins or other small objects can get stuck and cause an obstruction. Visually inspect these areas for any blockages, ensuring that nothing is causing interference. 

Another common issue when a washing machine isn’t working properly is a faulty door seal – these can become dislodged over time and cause water leakage into the drum during use, resulting in poor performance from your machine. Check for any signs of wear or tear on your seal, ensuring that it looks secure before continuing further diagnostics. 

If none of these checks have helped identify your problem then it could be something more complicated such as a wiring fault or blocked drain pipe – this will require professional help from an experienced appliance repair technician who can diagnose precisely what’s wrong with your machine and provide appropriate repairs. Our directory lists technicians who have been recommended based on their experience and customer feedback so you can be sure you’re getting quality service when needed!
