Prices vary depending on the size, quality and features of the oven, so make sure to do your research before making a purchase. 

Once you have purchased your pizza oven, it’s time to get cooking! There are some key tips to remember when using your new appliance: 
- Always light the fire with dry kindling and small logs – no larger than 10cm diameter is recommended 
- Make sure that the wood is burning steadily before adding any food 
- If using charcoal, make sure it’s spread evenly across the base of the oven 
- When adding food to the pizza stone, move quickly – an open flame is best for cooking pizzas!

- Ensure that children and pets stay away from hot surfaces at all times
