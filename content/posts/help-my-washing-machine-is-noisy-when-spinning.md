## My Washing Machine is Making a Lot of Noise

Having a washing machine spin cycle that’s making a lot of noise can be incredibly frustrating. There are numerous potential causes, making it difficult to identify the source of the issue. Could your washing machine need a minor fix or does it require a serious repair? In this article, we’ll take a look at some common causes of washing machine noises and how to address them. 

No matter how large or small the noise is, it’s important to address the issue as soon as possible to avoid further damage. Without an effective resolution, the sound will continue to disrupt your washing experience. 

In some cases, the sound may be an indication that something is out of place inside the unit. It’s easy to misplace clothing items, coins, and other objects in your machine - this could result in a high-pitched sound or clattering noise as the drum rotates. Be sure to check the drum to ensure that it’s clear of any items and that the door is properly closed. 

It’s also a good idea to use high-quality, low suds cleaning detergents that are specifically designed for machines. Low-cost detergents are often higher in suds, which can cause the drum to vibrate and create a humming sound.

There are also other common causes that may require more of an intervention. If the tub bearings are loose or worn, this could result in a loud noise as the drum rotates. This can be a difficult repair, so it’s important to bring in a professional appliance repair technician to inspect the machine and offer a solution.

If your washing machine has become noisy, then it’s important to take action. Check for any pieces of clothing or items out of place and if you’re using the right type of detergent for the machine. If the issue persists, it’s time to call in a professional service. Visit our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to find a technician in your area.
