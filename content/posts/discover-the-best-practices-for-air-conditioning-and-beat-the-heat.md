## Stay Cool and Beat the Heat with AC Best Practices

With summer in full swing, temperatures are soaring. As the mercury rises, so does the need for dependable air conditioning. To keep your air conditioning running smoothly and help you beat the heat, here are some best practices to keep your AC in top form. 

The most important best practice for air conditioning is regular maintenance and servicing. Make sure you clean the filter and coils regularly and take care of any problems quickly, before they can develop into more expensive issues. With regular care, common problems such as poor cooling, reduced air flow, and poor air quality can be avoided. 

To get the most out of your air conditioning, it’s also important to find the right size air conditioner for the space you are cooling. Having an air conditioner too powerful for the space can lead to high energy bills and mechanical wear and tear. An energy efficient thermostat is also a necessity, as it can monitor your energy consumption and help keep your energy bills low.

If you can, try to use external shading to reduce the load on the air conditioning. You can also open the windows of your home at night and close the curtains in the morning to keep out the day’s heat. If you are stuck with no air conditioning, using and individual fan is a better option than using multiple fans in a single room. 

By following these best practices, you can keep your air conditioning running smoothly and help you beat the heat without breaking the bank. If any problems do arise, our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) provides resources to have the issue taken care of quickly.

## Best Practices for Air Conditioning 

Q1: How often should I service my air conditioner? 
A1: Generally, air conditioners should be serviced annually and the filters should be changed on a regular basis, approximate every six months. 

Q2: What’s the best temperature to set my air conditioner to during summer? 
A2: Choosing the ideal temperature for your air conditioning depends on personal preferences, but it is generally recommended that the temperature be between 24-26° Celsius.

Q3: Can running the air conditioner too cold be bad for my health? 
A3: Generally, it is recommended to keep the air conditioner between 24-26° Celsius as temperatures lower than this could cause discomfort in some people and allergies, increased humidity, and oxygen imbalance. 

Q4: Are window-type air conditioners or split-type air conditioners better for home cooling? 
A4: Both window-type and split-type air conditioners can provide efficient and effective cooling, but overall split-type air conditioners are typically more energy efficient, quieter and take up less space than window-type air conditioners.

Q5: What is the best way to keep the air clean indoors while running the air conditioning? 
A5: It is important to ensure those living in the space are not bringing in pollutants from outside the building and the air conditioning filters are regularly changed. Consider investing in an air purifier to help filter out any lingering particles in the air.
