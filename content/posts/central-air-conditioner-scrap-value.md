As the weather gets warmer, it may be time to upgrade your air conditioner. But before you throw away your old unit, you should know that central air conditioners can have scrap value. Depending on the age and condition of the unit, it could be worth a substantial sum of money. 

Central air conditioning units are made of metal which is a valuable commodity. Scrap yards pay for copper, aluminum, and steel by weight. The exact price will vary based on the current market prices for these metals as well as their grade or quality. To maximize the value of your central air conditioner scrap, it’s important to know what type of metal is used in its construction. 

The evaporator and condenser coils are typically made from copper tubing with aluminum fins. It’s possible for these components to be worth more than other parts of the unit due to their higher copper content and better grade metal composition. A compressor is usually made from steel or aluminum depending on its size and age with some units containing brass valves. The exterior cabinet will most likely be aluminum or galvanized steel but could also include plastic components depending on its age and model type. 

When it comes time to sell your old central air conditioning unit for scrap, there are a few things you should consider first: 
- Are all parts intact? If not then they won't be accepted by most scrap yards since they usually prefer full units only; 
- Is there any visible damage? This can decrease the value significantly; 
- Is there any refrigerant gas still present in the system? Refrigerant gas must be removed safely before scrapping an AC unit; 
- What type of metal is used in its construction? Knowing this can help you get an accurate estimate of its worth at a local scrap yard; 

 Central air conditioners generally have good scrap value due to their high percentage of metal content but this can vary greatly depending on age, model type, size, and current market prices for metals like copper and aluminum. Before disposing of your old AC unit make sure that you research local scrap yard prices so that you get top dollar when selling it for scrap – especially if your unit contains valuable materials like copper tubing or brass valves!
