Ovens are an essential piece of kitchen equipment, but if they are not properly monitored and maintained, they can be a major safety hazard. One of the most common mistakes people make is leaving the oven on without supervision. This seemingly innocent act can lead to serious consequences and should be avoided at all costs. 

The first risk associated with leaving an oven on is fire. Unattended ovens can overheat or malfunction, leading to fires that can spread quickly and cause significant damage. Even if no fire occurs from leaving your oven on, smoke and increased temperatures in the kitchen could still pose a health risk for occupants of the home. 

Another danger associated with leaving an oven on is carbon monoxide poisoning. Although it’s rare for carbon monoxide poisoning to occur from a functioning oven, it can happen if there’s a malfunction or something blocking the ventilation system (like an old dishcloth). If left unchecked, carbon monoxide buildup in your home can lead to severe health complications such as dizziness, nausea, headaches and even death in extreme cases. 

To ensure safety while using your appliance, always turn it off when you are finished cooking or if you leave the room for any period of time longer than necessary (such as going out shopping). Additionally, make sure to check that all hoses and vents leading away from your oven are free from any obstructions so that air flows freely throughout your kitchen area. With proper care and maintenance of your appliance – coupled with smart decision-making when using it – you should be able to avoid any potential hazards caused by leaving an oven on unattended!
