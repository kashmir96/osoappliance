When it comes to laundry appliances, many people wonder which one is heavier - a washing machine or a dryer? The answer is that it depends on the type and size of the appliance. Generally speaking, dryers tend to be heavier than washing machines, but this is not always the case. 

Washing machines come in a variety of sizes and types, from top-loading to front-loading. Top-loading models tend to be lighter than front-loading models, as they don't require as much structural support. Generally, a top-loading washing machine will weigh between 50 and 100 pounds, while a front-loading model will weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. 

Dryers also come in a variety of sizes and types, from gas to electric. Gas dryers tend to be heavier than electric dryers, as they require more structural support. Generally, a gas dryer will weigh between 150 and 200 pounds, while an electric dryer will weigh between 100 and 150 pounds. 

In terms of overall weight, a dryer will usually be heavier than a washing machine. However, this is not always the case, as the size and type of the appliance can affect the weight. It's important to consider the size and type of the appliance before making a purchase, as this will help you determine which one is heavier.
