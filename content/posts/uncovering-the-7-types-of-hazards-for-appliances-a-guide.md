## Protect Yourself & Your Family with this Guide on Household Appliance Safety
Owning household appliances can make life easier, from dishwashers and washing machines to microwaves and stoves. But these items can also be hazardous, and failure to take proper care of them can lead to dangerous situations. To ensure your safety, it's important to familiarize yourself with the seven types of appliance hazards.

The most common hazards associated with appliances are fire, electric shock, and burns. It is essential to regularly check wiring, cords, plugs, and other receptacles to make sure they are intact and functioning properly. It is also a good idea to move any furniture away from older appliances, as they may be more likely to overheat.

In addition, the cords and plugs of modern appliances must be in proper condition. When unplugging any appliance, make sure to grasp the plug and not the cord itself. Check the receptacles in which the cords are plugged to make sure they are not loose, worn, or cracked. Keep all appliance cords away from any heat source, and avoid running cords under carpets or furniture.

Other types of household appliances may also present hazards. Gas stoves, gas space heaters, water heaters, and clothes dryers all use fire and therefore must be used and maintained with caution. All appliances should be regularly inspected for signs of wear and to ensure proper functioning.

Another potential hazard is improper use of electrical outlets. Try to avoid ever plugging in more than one appliance into a single receptacle. Also, it is safer to use a surge protector rather than plugging an appliance directly into the wall socket.

In addition, small appliances like toasters, irons, hair dryers, mixers, and blenders may pose a hazard to unsuspecting children. These need to be kept on high enough surfaces and out of reach from children.

Finally, potential hazards can exist due to careless operation of appliances. Always make sure that you follow the manual’s instructions for use, and read the warning labels. It is important to regularly clean the appliance and keep track of all product recalls.

Being aware of the common appliance hazards will help ensure the safety of you and your family. There’s no need to be scared away from the convenience of modern appliances; the key is to be aware of the potential risks and make sure everything is functioning properly. Take the time to read up on your household appliances and make sure that you are taking all of the necessary safety precautions.
