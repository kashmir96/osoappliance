## Disposing of an Old Refrigerator

As you begin searching for a new refrigerator, it can be easy to forget the important task of properly disposing of your existing refrigerator. Knowing how to dispose of an old refrigerator is key to making sure your old appliance recycled or reused responsibly.

When it comes to getting rid of an old refrigerator, it’s important to choose an option that not only meets your disposal needs, but also helps protect the environment. Fortunately, there are many options available that make it easy to dispose of old fridges.

The best and most cost-effective option for most people is to call their local waste disposal service. Most towns and cities have waste management services that can collect, recycle, and properly dispose of your old refrigerator. Some services may charge a fee for the collection, but it’s usually slightly cheaper than hiring a private company.

If you can’t find a waste disposal company that will come and collect your old fridge, then you could also try donating it to a charity. Charities often accept old fridges and other household items, and any money they make from selling them will go toward a good cause.

Alternatively, you could also choose to recycle the Fridge yourself. Many scrap metal yards will accept fridge’s and other metal items, and can turn them into consumer goods, such as cans and computers. This is the most environmentally friendly option, as it prevents the old fridge from ending up in a landfill.

No matter what option you choose, it’s important to make sure that all of the refrigerant and other hazardous materials are disposed of safely and in accordance with local and federal regulations.

Disposing of an old refrigerator can be a daunting task, but it’s one that needs to be taken on responsibly. Knowing how to properly dispose of your old fridge can help ensure that it is recycled or reused in the best way possible.
