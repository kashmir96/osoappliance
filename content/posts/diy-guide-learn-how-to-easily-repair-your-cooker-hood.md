## Repair Your Own Cooker Hood to Avoid Costly Servicing
Do you have a cooker hood that's stopped working properly? Don't worry - you don't need to hire an appliance repair technician to fix it. This DIY guide will help you to easily repair your own cooker hood.

There are several common problems that can occur with cooker hoods that you can easily take care of yourself. The first step is to check your appliance's manual to ensure you're taking the proper precautions as you work. Be sure to also keep your safety in mind - never work on any appliance without turning the power off.

The first thing to do is to clean the hood. This will help improve the performance of your cooker hood and can often be the answer to many issues. First, remove the screws and filters of the hood. Then, wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove any dust, grime, and oil residue. Retain the filters and wash them separately in soapy water. Allow them to air-dry before reinstalling.

If cleaning the hood doesn't help, the motor may need replacing. To replace the motor, you'll need to turn off the power to the hood and then unscrew the motor. Remember to unplug it, too. You'll need to find a motor that matches the size and wiring connections of your old one. Once you've found a match, attach it using screws and mount it back in the appropriate place.

If replacing the motor doesn't help, a ductwork issue may be the culprit. Check the ductwork for any kinks or punctures. If the ductwork appears to be ok, inspect the fan located near the bottom of the hood and make sure it is correctly mounted and secured.

These are just a few of the steps you can take to repair your own cooker hood at home. If all else fails, it may be best to hire a professional appliance repair technician. Our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) will help you find a qualified technician who can help you with all your appliance repair needs.
