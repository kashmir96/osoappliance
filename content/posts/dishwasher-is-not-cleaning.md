If your dishwasher isn’t cleaning your dishes properly, it can be an incredibly frustrating experience. There are a few common causes of this problem and some simple solutions that can help you get your dishwasher back to its former glory. 

One of the most common causes of a dishwasher not cleaning dishes is a clogged filter. The filter is responsible for catching any food particles that might be left on dishes before they enter the dishwasher. If it becomes clogged, it won’t be able to do its job properly and the dishes won’t come out as clean as they should. To fix this, you can take out the filter and give it a good clean with a brush or a sponge. 

Another potential cause of a dishwasher not cleaning dishes is a lack of detergent. If you’re not using enough detergent, it won’t be able to break down the food particles on the dishes and they won’t come out as clean. Make sure you’re using the right amount of detergent for the size of your load. 

Finally, if your dishwasher isn’t cleaning dishes properly, it could be due to a lack of water pressure. If the water pressure is too low, it won’t be able to effectively clean the dishes. To fix this, check the water pressure from your faucet and make sure it’s not too low. If it is, you may need to call a plumber to increase the pressure. 

If your dishwasher isn’t cleaning dishes properly, it can be a real hassle. However, with a few simple steps you can get it back to its former glory. Start by checking the filter and cleaning it if necessary, make sure you’re using the right amount of detergent, and check the water pressure to make sure it’s not too low. With a little bit of work, you’ll have your dishwasher cleaning dishes like new again.
