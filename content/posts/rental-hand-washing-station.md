Hand washing stations are an increasingly popular rental option for outdoor events and gatherings. They provide a convenient, sanitary way for guests to maintain good hygiene in a safe and efficient manner. Hand washing stations are becoming more common due to the current pandemic and the need for extra protection against illnesses.

Renting a hand washing station is a great way to ensure your guests stay healthy while attending your event or gathering. These portable units typically come with multiple sinks and hot water tanks that allow multiple people to wash their hands at once. This helps reduce wait times and keeps people from having to line up in long lines outside of bathrooms or other facilities. The hand washing station also provides soap, paper towels, and other necessary items needed for proper handwashing techniques. 

Additionally, renting a handwashing station can be cost-effective compared to hiring additional employees or installing permanent fixtures like plumbing systems at your venue location. Not only do they save you money but they also help speed up the process of getting everyone’s hands clean quickly before eating or participating in activities at your gathering.
 
You may be wondering how much it costs to rent a handwashing station? The price varies greatly depending on size of unit, length of rental period, delivery/pickup fees (if applicable), etc., but generally speaking you can expect prices starting around $100 per day for smaller units all the way up into the thousands per day for larger units with multiple sinks/tanks and extra amenities such as heating elements, cold water options, etc.. 
 
When renting any type of service it’s important that you do your research so you know exactly what you’re getting when it comes time to make payment arrangements with the vendor providing the service. Make sure they have all necessary licenses & permits; as well as insurance coverage in case something goes wrong during setup/operation/take down of their equipment onsite at your venue location. Also inquire about any special requirements they may have regarding setup/take down (including access requirements) so there aren’t any surprises during event day that could impact the operation of their services which could end up costing you more money than originally anticipated if not handled properly ahead of time!
