## Is Your Washer Refusing To Start Its Wash Cycle?
Do you ever feel frustrated when your washer is not cooperating? If you are experiencing any issues with your washer not going through the wash cycle, then you are not alone. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue, however there are some common troubleshooting steps you can take to help get your washer going again.

The first step is to make sure all the settings of your washer are correct. Check if the water level is set properly, if the temperature setting is correct, and if all switches are in the correct position. If all this is set correctly, then you could have an issue with the timer or water supply. If the timer isn't working correctly, it could be continuing to fill the machine with water even after it is supposed to start the cycle. You should try resetting the timer or replacing it if necessary. If the water supply isn't functioning properly, it won't be able to fill the machine with enough water, so you should check all of the valves and hosing.

If you have checked all of these items, and the washer is still not functioning properly, it may be due to something more serious such as a burnt-out motor or broken belt. In this case, you may need to call a professional. If you'd like to diagnose the issue yourself, you can find many helpful resources online, including our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary.

Faulty washers can be a real hassle, but with some patience and the right knowledge, you can get it up and running again! If you are experiencing any issues with your washer, refer to the checklist above and our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary to help identify and solve the problem.
