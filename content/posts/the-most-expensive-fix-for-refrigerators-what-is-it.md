## A Look at the Priciest Repair Needed for Refrigerators

If your refrigerator has broken down and you’re trying to figure out what the most expensive repair cost could possibly be, you’ve come to the right place. The cost of a refrigerator repair can vary greatly depending on the parts and the labor involved. However, there is one repair that you can be prepared for, one of the most expensive repairs that you may encounter: the compressor. 

The compressor is what keeps the refrigerator working properly and is responsible for transferring the fluid between the evaporator and condenser coils. If your refrigerator is no longer keeping things cold inside, the compressor may be the culprit. When this happens, the repair typically involves replacing the compressor, gaskets, fan, mounting plate, and start capacitor, which can add up to a hefty repair bill. Even if you have a DIY attitude, you will still need expensive tools and specialty knowledge of refrigeration mechanics to complete the job.

Another expensive repair is related to the thermostat. Thermostats help regulate both the temperature and the energy efficiency of your refrigerator, and if it’s not working correctly, the cost will be pretty high. In some cases, the thermostat may build up contaminants and need to be replaced entirely, which can add up. 

Overall, the most expensive repair needed for a refrigerator typically involves either the compressor or thermostat. But if you’re preemptive and you purchase and maintain a high quality refrigerator, you can significantly reduce the chances of needing to pay for a costly repair.
