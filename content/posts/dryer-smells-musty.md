If your dryer smells musty, it's likely due to a buildup of lint and other debris in the lint trap, ducts, and exhaust vent. This buildup can cause moisture to get trapped in the dryer, creating a musty smell. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to get rid of the smell and keep it from coming back.

First, make sure to clean the lint trap after each use. This will help keep lint from accumulating in the trap and will also help reduce the amount of lint that gets into the dryer ducts.

Next, it's important to clean the dryer ducts and exhaust vent on a regular basis. This will help remove any lint or debris that has built up over time. You can do this yourself or hire a professional to do it for you.

Finally, make sure to leave the dryer door open after each use to allow the interior to dry out. This will help reduce the moisture in the dryer and will help prevent the musty smell from coming back.

By following these simple steps, you can help keep your dryer smelling fresh and free of musty odors.
