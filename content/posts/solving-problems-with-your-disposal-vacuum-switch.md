A: First, unplug the disposal from the power outlet. Next, carefully remove the cover plate from the switch and inspect for any visible debris. If needed, use a soft cloth or a wire brush to clean the contacts of the switch. When you are finished cleaning, put the cover plate back on and plug the disposal back in.
