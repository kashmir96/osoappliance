## Reset Samsung Refrigerator Error Code 8E - A Quick Guide

Have you ever encountered error code 8E while using your Samsung refrigerator? If you are a novice user of household appliances, you may worry since it may seem like a daunting problem you cannot fix on your own. But fret not! This quick guide will help you tackle this issue and get your Samsung refrigerator back in business.

When you see error code 8E on your refrigerator, it means your refrigerator has detected a malfunction in one of its fan motors. This may be due to electrical surge, overloading or clogged air filters. Whatever the cause, resetting error code 8E often resolves the problem and your refrigerator can return to normal working condition. 

Before we get into the details, it would be helpful to first disconnect the power cord of your refrigerator. After that, the best place to start is to check the air filter of your refrigerator. There is a possibility of the air filter being blocked or clogged, which can lead to the error occurring. If the air filters are clogged, simply clear out the dirt and dust with a vacuum.

If it turns out the air filters are not clogged, you should go through a more complex process of resetting your refrigerator. It involves performing a hard reset which is a specific process for different models of Samsung refrigerators. To perform this hard reset, you’ll need to unplug the power cord, press and hold the power freeze and power cool buttons, and plug the power cord back in while keeping the buttons pressed. Keep holding until you hear the refrigerator click, then release the buttons to reset the technical code. 

In some cases, these basic steps may not rectify the problem. If that’s the case, contact a professional repair serviceto troubleshoot the issue further. They will be able to diagnose the problem more accurately and recommend the best ways to fix it.

As you can see, there are a few ways to go about fixing error code 8E on your Samsung refrigerator. It may seem confusing at first, but by following the steps above, you’ll be back on track in no time. If all else fails, don’t hesitate to give a professional a call to take a look at your appliance.
