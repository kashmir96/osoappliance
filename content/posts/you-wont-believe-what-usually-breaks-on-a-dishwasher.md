## Common Dishwasher Malfunctions
Are you starting to suspect something is not quite right with your dishwasher? Dishwashers are an essential part of keeping things tidy in the kitchen, but if something stops working right, you may be left with a sink full of dirty dishes. If you are already noticing that your dishwasher is not working correctly, you probably already know that it’s time to start looking into what’s wrong. 

Many times, dishwasher issues can be easily identified and can sometimes be fixed yourself. Unfortunately, they can also be a sign of a larger problem. Some of the most common malfunctions that you may experience include broken door seals, faulty pumps, blocked spray arms and faulty heating elements. 

Doors seals may become loose or cracked over time, leaving gaps in the insulator. This can lead to bigger issues as it may allow water to leak and cause damage to your kitchen. Your door seal should be inspected periodically and replaced if needed. Similarly, your pumps may become clogged or jammed due to food deposits or excess grease. This can cause them to wear out prematurely or stop working altogether. 

In addition, your dishwasher spray arms may become clogged or blocked from food or detergent build up, preventing them from spraying the water evenly throughout the cycle. This can be remedied by running a cycle with a bowl of vinegar, or by removing and cleaning the arms. Heating elements can become damaged over time and they start to heat less efficiently. Many times this will require professional assistance to identify and replace.
