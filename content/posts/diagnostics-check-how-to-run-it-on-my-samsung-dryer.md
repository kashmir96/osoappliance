## How to Perform a Diagnostic Check on My Samsung Dryer
Owning an efficient, dependable dryer is now an expectation for many households. Fortunately, Samsung dryers have built-in diagnostic systems to help detect any malfunctions. By running a diagnostic check, users not only ensure the dryer is performing optimally, but they can also significantly reduce the potential need for repairs. 

Performing a diagnostic check on a Samsung dryer is relatively straightforward process. First, the user needs to turn off the dryer and unplug it from its outlet. They should then locate the diagnostic test mode button on the internal wiring panel. Depending on the model, the button may be labeled differently, for instance “Start/Pause,” “Wrinkle Prevent,” “Extra Dry” or something similar. 

After pressing the diagnostic button, the user should run the washer with a small load of lightly soiled towels. The dryer will then run three separate tests: the first to check the drive motor; the second to check the thermal fuse; and the last to test the thermostats. After each test is completed, the corresponding light or LED will flash or the machine will beep. If all of the lights or LED’s flash and the beeping sound is heard, then the diagnostic cycle has been successfully completed.

Therefore, runnning a diagnostic check on a Samsung dryer not only keeps your appliance running smoothly but can also save you time, money and frustration that may come with dryer repairs.
