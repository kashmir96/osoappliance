## Know the Risks of Electricity 

Electricity is a necessary part of our daily lives and we rely on it to power our electronics, appliances, and other devices. Unfortunately, with great power comes great risk.It is important to understand the potential safety hazards of electricity and take steps to ensure a safe environment in your home. Below are five (5) dangers of electricity that you need to know.

### Electrical Shock or Arc Flash

Electric shock is one of the greatest dangers associated with using electricity. It results from contact between a person and live electrical parts, or when a person and a grounded metal object becomes a direct path for current to travel from the power source to ground. Electrical shock can be fatal, and even if it does not cause direct injury, it can cause a person to become seriously injured due to shock-related activities such as falling.

### Fire Hazards

Electricity can also cause fires. Faulty electrical wiring, overloading outlets, and DIY electrical work can all lead to short circuits and other problems that result in sparks and open flames. It’s important to practice safe wiring, use GFCIs, and install carbon monoxide detectors to stay safe from electrical fires.

### Electromagnetic Interference

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) occurs when electrical devices radiate and receive energy interference from other devices in their vicinity. This can lead to poor performance of the device, or even a failure of the device, if the EMI is not properly managed or shielded. 

### Electrocution

Electrocution results from contact between a person and an energized conductor, such as a live wire or outlets. It is an extremely serious safety hazard and can be fatal in many cases.

### Overloading

Electricity is a powerful force and can overload power outlets, resulting in damage to the wiring, home heating systems, and other appliances. It’s important to make sure that you don't plug too many appliances into the same outlet and to keep an eye on your energy consumption.

Electricity is an incredible force and can make our lives much more convenient. It’s important to understand the risks associated with it and take steps to reduce the potential hazards.
