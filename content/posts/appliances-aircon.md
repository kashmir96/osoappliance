When the heat of summer hits, nothing is better than a good air conditioner to keep you cool. But what exactly is an air conditioner? An air conditioner is an appliance that cools and dehumidifies the air in your home or business. It works by drawing in hot air from the outside, cooling it, and then pumping it back into your space.

An air conditioner typically consists of an indoor unit (evaporator coil), an outdoor unit (condenser coil) and a compressor. The evaporator coil collects hot air from inside your home and passes it over cold refrigerant lines which cools it down before pushing it back into your home or office. The condenser coil does the opposite by collecting warm outside air, heating up the refrigerant lines, and then pushing the warm outside air back out of your house or business. The compressor pumps refrigerant through these coils to help regulate temperatures inside your home or office. 

There are several types of air conditioning systems available including window units, central AC systems, portable AC units and split system ACs. Window units are ideal for cooling small spaces such as bedrooms or offices while central AC systems are best suited for larger spaces such as entire homes or businesses. Portable AC units can be moved around to provide cooling wherever you need them while split system ACs offer a combination of efficiency and convenience with separate indoor and outdoor components that can be managed independently. 

No matter which type of system you choose, regular maintenance is key to ensure that your AC runs at its peak performance level year-round. This includes cleaning filters regularly, checking for leaks in ductwork/piping insulation and having professionals inspect all components annually for any signs of wear & tear or problems that need repair/replacement parts installed . 

Having a properly working aircon can make all the difference when trying to stay comfortable during those hot summer months!
