## Dealing with the e16 Error Code

Fear not, for we have the low down on how to manage the e16 error code and get your appliance running again quickly.

The e16 error code typically occurs when there is an issue with the water supply to the machine. This could mean a lack of supply, or it may simply the machine not being able to read the signal from the supply. It could also occur due to a fault with the heating element within the machine.
