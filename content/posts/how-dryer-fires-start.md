Dryer fires are becoming an increasingly common household hazard. Although most people associate dryer fires with lint build-up, the truth is that a number of different issues can cause a dryer fire. In this blog, we'll explore the various causes of dryer fires and some tips for preventing them. 

The most common cause of a dryer fire is lint buildup in the machine or in the vent leading outside. As clothing tumbles around in the drum during a cycle, tiny fibers from your clothes may become detached and accumulate inside. This buildup can create an incredibly flammable environment that could ignite if it comes into contact with heat or even sparks from electrical components inside your machine or along its venting system. 

In addition to lint buildup, other factors that can lead to dryer fires include: 
• Faulty wiring – If there are any loose connections inside your machine or along its venting system, these can create sparks which could ignite any combustible material within the vicinity 
• Overheating – Dryers require adequate ventilation to prevent overheating and potential ignition from high temperatures 
• Blockages – Any debris such as dirt, leaves or bird nests blocking up vents leading outside of your home can be highly combustible and increase risk of fire 
• Ignition Sources – Having items like cloths hampers or other combustibles close to your dryer could provide ignition sources if they come into contact with high temperatures generated by your appliance

Fortunately there are steps you can take to reduce risk of a dryer fire in your home: 
• Clean Out Your Lint Trap Regularly - It's important to clean out your lint trap after every use as this will help reduce dangerous accumulations within both the drum and venting system 
• Check Vents & Ducts - Over time vents leading outside may become blocked with debris so it's crucial you check them regularly for blockages • Have Your Machine Professionally Inspected - It's best practice to have qualified personnel inspect electrical connections and components within both new machines as well as those already present within your home on an annual basis 
• Keep Flammables Away - Make sure not place anything flammable near your machine including clothes hampers 

With proper maintenance you should be able to greatly reduce risk associated with potential ignitions leading to house fire caused by malfunctioning appliances such as a clothes dryers. 

If you suspect a fire in your dryer, shut off the power at once and contact your local fire department immediately.
