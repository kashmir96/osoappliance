Permanent press is a setting on a clothes dryer that is designed to help prevent wrinkles from forming on clothes. It is also sometimes referred to as the “no-iron” setting. This setting works by using a combination of low heat and a longer drying time to help relax the fibers in the fabric. This helps to reduce wrinkles and makes it easier to iron or press the clothes after they are dry.

The permanent press setting is most often used on synthetic fabrics such as polyester, nylon, and rayon. These fabrics tend to hold onto wrinkles more easily than natural fabrics such as cotton and linen. The permanent press setting helps to relax the fibers in these fabrics and reduce the amount of wrinkles that form.

When using the permanent press setting on a dryer, it is important to pay attention to the instructions on the care label of the clothing item. Many items may require a slightly different setting than the permanent press setting. Some items may require a lower heat setting, while others may require a higher heat setting. It is also important to pay attention to the drying time. If the item is left in the dryer too long, it can cause the fabric to become over-dried and stiff, resulting in more wrinkles.

Overall, the permanent press setting is a great way to help reduce wrinkles on clothes and make them easier to iron or press. It is important to pay attention to the care label on the clothing item and adjust the settings accordingly to ensure the best results.
