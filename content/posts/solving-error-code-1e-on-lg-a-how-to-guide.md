## Error Code 1e on LG - Diagnosing and Repairing the Issue
Problems with electronics can be overwhelming and extremely frustrating. When an error code flashes on your LG appliance, it's natural to feel a bit of panic. When the code reads 1e, this can be a serious issue that requires professional help. But, with the right information, it's possible to diagnose and even fix the problem yourself. 

When the 1e error code appears on an LG appliance, this means there is an issue with the electronic control board. This board is responsible for important functions, like running the motor and controlling the temperature. In short, it's integral to the operating system of the appliance. Unfortunately, the cause of the error is most often the failure of this control board, which is a major part of the appliance. 

When the error code appears, there are a few steps users can take to troubleshoot and identify the source of the issue. First, it's important to check the power source of the appliance. Since the 1e error code often means the control board has failed, users should check to make sure it is receiving the proper power. If it seems the power source is not directing adequate power to the board, users should contact a professional.

When the power source is acceptable but the error code persists, it's time to inspect the board. There could be a number of causes here, such as corrosion, loose wiring, or a faulty circuit. It is possible to inspect the board yourself, but this task is best left to a professional. 

Should the issue persist, users may have to replace the board altogether. Again, this task is best left to a professional, but users can order the part and coordinate installation as needed. Replacement control boards are available online and by making a few calls.

It can be a nightmare to find and fix an error code like 1e on your LG appliance. But, with a little research and effort, users may be able to address the issue and get their appliance running again. Before attempting a fix and if users feel in over their head, they should contact a professional.
