As the summer months begin, many of us turn to our trusty window air conditioners to keep our homes cool and comfortable. But at the end of the season, it can be hard to know what to do with that bulky unit that’s been taking up precious window space for months. Before you get rid of it or store it in your basement, consider looking into its scrap value.

Scrap value is the worth of an item based on its metal components when recycled or sold as scrap metal. Window air conditioners typically contain copper, aluminum and steel parts; these materials can be sold for a decent price depending on the current market rate. Knowing how much your window AC is worth may encourage you to recycle it instead of throwing it away.

To determine the exact scrap value of your old window AC unit, try visiting a local scrap yard or recycling center in your area—they will be able to tell you exactly how much money you could receive for recycling your unit. You can also search online for current market rates on certain metals like copper and aluminum; keep in mind that these prices may change depending on supply and demand so do some research before visiting a local center. 

When taking your old air conditioner in for scrap, make sure all parts are accounted for (including wires) as this will ensure that you get full payment from the recycler or buyer based on what they are willing to pay per pound. If possible, take apart pieces like fans and compressors before bringing them in as this will help maximize their value since they are made from higher-priced metals such as copper and steel. 

Getting rid of an old window air conditioner doesn’t have to mean throwing out something useless; by looking into its potential scrap value first, you could not only make some extra cash but also help support more sustainable practices by recycling instead of throwing away!
