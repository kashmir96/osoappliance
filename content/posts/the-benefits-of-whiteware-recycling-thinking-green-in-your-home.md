## Making Eco-Friendly Choices at Home

There are plenty of small choices we can make to help protect the environment. One often-overlooked choice is whiteware recycling. Whiteware, such as refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines, are among the most often-recycled whiteware items. Making sure to responsibly and properly handle the recyclable whiteware in our homes can help make a huge difference in reducing waste.

Not only is whiteware recycling beneficial in reducing waste, but it also has financial implications. Being able to recycle and resell functioning whiteware can grant a windfall of recycled cash; this money can then be used to invest in newer, improved versions of the old appliances. Making sure to properly recycle whiteware will ensure that the old appliance is not sold or reused when it should have been scrapped or recycled for its parts.

Furthermore, recycling whiteware reduces the amount of energy used to manufacture new appliances. This is key in fighting climate change, as these manufacturing processes produce significant amounts of pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. Reducing the amount of energy and resources used in production saves money and reduces the harmful emissions released into our atmosphere.

Finally, whiteware recycling can help reduce the number of hazardous chemicals entering the environment. Chemical-based refrigerants, such as propane and ammonia, are found in many whiteware products. If these appliances are not properly handled, it can lead to these hazardous chemicals leaking into the soil or being released into the air.

Whiteware recycling is a great way to help both our wallets and the environment. Not only does it help us save money, but it also contributes to a healthier, cleaner environment. By recycling whiteware, we can take part in helping to reduce the amount of waste entering landfills and reducing the amount of energy used in manufacturing new appliances.

When youâ€™re ready to upgrade your whiteware, consider the eco-friendly option of responsibly recycling your old appliance. Doing your part in reducing waste and emissions helps to protect our environment and all of its inhabitants.
