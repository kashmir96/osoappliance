## Tackling the Problem of Broken Glass in the Dryer

Finding broken glass in your dryer can be an alarming experience – it’s easy to worry that you may have stolen some of the appliance’s parts or caused irreparable damage. Fear not, you probably haven’t caused tremendous damage, and it also doesn’t have to be a drawn out, time consuming process to get it fixed. Here we’ll look at the steps you can take to get rid of broken glass from your dryer, and how you can ensure it doesn’t occur again in the future. 

The first thing to do after finding broken glass in your dryer is to take time to make sure you have removed all of it. Inspect the drum of your dryer carefully, and use a flashlight to ensure you haven’t missed any hidden shards. Once you are certain that all the glass has been removed, you will want to examine the filters. There may be traces of glass stuck to them which should be removed with an old soft cloth or old toothbrush – when you’ve done this, it’s then time to check the lint screen. Be gentle as you clean this, as it is made of a fine mesh and you don’t want to damage it.

Away from the physical task of cleaning, you should take a moment to think about what may have caused the glass to enter your dryer in the first place. Chances are you’ve left something in a pocket and forgotten to empty it, or washing could have been washed from glass items – mix some whites with a few reds, for example. If glass is regularly appearing in your dryer, you must take extra care to check for it every time as otherwise it can damage your clothes, not to mention the machine itself.
