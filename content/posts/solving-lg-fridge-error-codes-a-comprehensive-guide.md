## Unravel the Mystery of LG Fridge Error Codes

When your fridge stops working it can be a real headache. Those error codes flashing up on the display don’t make things any easier, leaving you unsure of what it means or what to do. Don’t panic, as this article aims to provide an easy step-by-step guide for decoding LG fridge error codes and getting it up and running again in no time. 

If your LG fridge is subject to a “ER” error code, simply unplug the power for about two minutes to reset the ice maker. If the error code is still displayed after two minutes, the internal temperature of the fridge may have dropped too low and needs to defrost. If this is the case, unplug the fridge and leave it unplugged for 24 hours. 

If at the end of the 24 hours you are still not seeing a temperature display, replace the NEW part TD-20C relay fuse. If the error code is “1F”, this means there is a problem with the evaporator fan motor or the relay. This part is also easily replaced.

Error codes of “dE” or “OF” usually mean that the fridge is displaying the wrong temperature. The source of this issue is usually due to a faulty thermistor, which can be replaced by a qualified technician. The same advice applies for error codes “dF”, “dO”, “d1”, and “dC”, which all relate to errors with the fridge temperature.

Error codes on LG fridges will often display as “ER FF”, “ER IF” or “ER dH”, all of which are related to problems with the Air Flow or Evaporator Temperature. If the error code is “dH”, there may be a problem with the water line and the water inlet valve has to be replaced. “ER IF” is usually caused by a clogged defrost drain line, which can often be unclogged by using a wet/dry vacuum. 

The last common LG fridge error code is usually displayed as “ER dd”, which relates to errors with the ice-make motor and tray. If your fridge is displaying this code, you can first use a hairdryer to melt any ice that may be blocking the motor. If this does not solve the problem, then you will need to order a replacement ice make motor part. 

In conclusion, LG fridge error codes may seem like a nightmare at first, but with the right information and instructions it should be a relatively simple task to get it up and running again.
