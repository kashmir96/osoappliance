## Household Appliances Last Long When Properly Maintained: A Look at the Lifespan of LG Front Loaders 
When it comes to household appliances, the life of a product largely depends on how well it is maintained- an investment in regular cleaning and maintenance can save consumers hundreds in repair and replacement costs down the line. In this post, let's take a look at front loaders by LG and their average lifespan. 

LG boasts a strong and reliable lineup of appliances and their front loaders are no exception. Manufactured to be moisture- and energy-efficient, these machines have a few very notable attributes that set them apart from the competition. Front loaders by LG come with several innovative features. For instance, their TurboWash setting helps reduce washing time without sacrificing washing quality.

While the design and features play a huge role in the overall lifespan of any machine, their results are dependent on proper maintenance and upkeep. One of the best ways to extend the lifetime of your LG front loader is to use high-efficiency detergents that are designed to prevent the buildup of mineral deposits.
