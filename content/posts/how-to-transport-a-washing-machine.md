# How to transport a washing machine

Moving a washing machine can be a daunting task, but with the right preparation and tools, it can be done safely and efficiently. Here are some tips for transporting a washing machine:

1. Prepare the Washing Machine: Before you start transporting your washing machine, you'll need to make sure it's properly prepared. Start by unplugging the power cord from the wall outlet. Then, turn off the water supply valves and disconnect any hoses connected to the washer. If your washer has an agitator, remove it before moving the machine.

2. Gather Moving Supplies: You'll need some supplies to help make moving your washing machine easier and safer. Get some heavy-duty straps or rope to secure the washer during transport, as well as furniture sliders or blankets to protect it from scratches or dents while in transit. You may also want to get a dolly or hand truck for easier maneuvering of your appliance.

3. Insert Transport Bolts: To avoid damaging your washing machine install the provided transport bolts that keep the drum still during transport–this will stop you from damaging the drum and shock absorbers. 

4. Load Up Your Vehicle: Once you have all of your supplies ready, carefully load up your vehicle with your washing machine and other items you'll need for transport (such as furniture sliders). Make sure everything is secure before driving off!

5. Unload at Your Destination: When you arrive at your destination, unload your washer carefully using furniture sliders if necessary. Reattach any hoses that were disconnected earlier and plug in the power cord into an outlet before turning on any water supply valves again. Finally, reattach any agitators that were removed prior to transport if applicable.

With these tips in mind, transporting a washing machine should be relatively easy! Just remember to take extra precaution when loading up and unloading the appliance so that no damage occurs during transit – this will ensure that your washer is safe and ready for use once it arrives at its new home!
