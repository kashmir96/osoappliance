## Choosing the Right Hair Dryer 

When it comes to ensuring great looking hair, the most important tool to have is the right hair dryer. But, with so many options on the market, it can be difficult to decide which one is the best hair dryer for you. Before you make your purchase, it is important to consider size, power and even noise level to find the biggest and the best hair dryer to fit your needs.

The size of the dryer should be the primary factor you consider. You should measure the length of your hair. If you have long hair, it is in your best interest to invest in a bigger dryer, such as a full-size or a travel-size dryer. Smaller blow dryers won’t be able to adequately dry thick and long hair; making it difficult to get the desired style.

You should also come to a conclusion on the power of the hair dryer. Mid-range dryers are good for most people, providing about 1,500-2,000 watts. For those with thick and dry hair, however, a dryer with more watts may best suit you. The higher watts can help speed up the drying process, leaving you with a better result in the end.

Noise level is a crucial factor to consider as well. When selecting a larger hair dryer, you want to make sure it runs quietly. You may find a high-powered dryer that is relatively quiet; look for one with a lower decibel rating. Some of the high-powered models tend to be louder and louder dryers can cause damage to your ears over time.

Ultimately, the best hair dryer for you depends on the length of your hair and the level of power and noise you are looking for. Once you have determined your ideal size, power, and noise level, you can more accurately compare major brands and purchase the best one for your needs. 

Finding the perfect hair dryer will make maintaining your hair that much easier. To help ensure your purchase lives up to its promise, consult a local home appliance repair professional about any maintenance you may need to do before and after purchasing, or if you encounter any problems.
