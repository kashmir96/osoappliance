## Understanding Symbols on Your Samsung Washing Machine

We've all been there: you're looking at your Samsung washing machine, trying to decipher all the symbols and wondering what they mean. Before you can get your washing started it’s important to understand all the symbols and their purpose. Washing machine symbols can differ slightly between different models but, most machines will share many of the same symbols.

The symbols are generally grouped into two main categories: options and settings. The options are the different programs you can use (e.g. superwash, rinse and spin, delicates, etc.), while the settings relate to the various water temperature and spin speed options. To get an idea of the types of settings that are available on your Samsung washing machine, look for the touch pad, dials or buttons in the centre of the machine’s control panel. 

The way you adjust the settings will depend on the type of control panel your Samsung machine has. With touch-pad controls, all you need to do is press the relevant button to adjust the settings. With a dial, you can rotate the knob to the desired setting. And, with some machines, you can also use a push button control to adjust the settings. Once you have made your adjustments, you can select the program you want to use.

If you ever come across a symbol that you don’t recognize or don’t understand, it’s best to consult your washing machine’s user manual. Failing that, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) should help you figure out what the symbol means. 

By understanding the symbols and settings on your Samsung washing machine, you’ll be better equipped to get your laundry done quickly and effectively. So, be sure to take the time to familiarise yourself with the various symbols and settings – it’ll make your life a lot easier!
