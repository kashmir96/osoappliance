## Diagnosing Your Bosch Washing Machine
Having problems with your Bosch washing machine? Running a diagnostic is a great way to get to the source of the issue and easily troubleshoot your appliance. Not sure how it's done? We've got you covered. 

To start your diagnostic, begin by coordinating a power cycle of your washing machine by unplugging the appliance for 30 seconds, plugging it back in, and powering it on. Run a quick test cycle with a wash, rinse, and spin. If the issue persists, refer to the Bosch washing machine user guide for the proper coding and troubleshooting of your appliance. 

Next, consult your Bosch manual for a diagnostic test to use for your washing machine. You may find instructions for a test cycle that involves a special combination of start and pause buttons. Depending on the results of your test, the code may need to be reset and additional tests will need to be performed. 

If the test results indicate an operational fault, you may need to contact a Bosch service technician to diagnose the problem more thoroughly. A service technician will be able to determine the source of the problem and make repairs accordingly. 

Diagnosing your Bosch washing machine can seem intimidating. However, by using the user guide and manual, as well as following some basic steps, you can easily troubleshoot the appliance.
