It's no surprise that air conditioners don't last forever. Eventually, they need to be replaced or repaired with new parts. But, if your air conditioner is still in relatively good shape and you just need to replace a few parts, then doing so can be a great way to save money and extend the life of your unit.

So what types of replacement parts are available for air conditioners? Let's take a look at some of the most common ones:

1. Filters: Air conditioner filters help keep dust particles and other pollutants out of the air that passes through it. Over time, these filters become clogged with dirt and debris, reducing their efficiency and performance. Replacing filters regularly can help maintain peak performance levels while also improving indoor air quality. 
 
2. Coils: The evaporator coil helps absorb heat from inside your home as warm air passes over it while the condenser coil radiates heat away from your home as hot air passes over it. If either one becomes damaged or worn out due to age or excessive use, then replacing them can help restore efficiency levels in your AC unit. 
 
3. Fans: The fans are responsible for circulating cool air into the house during operation mode and pushing hot air out during defrost mode when necessary. When fans become worn out due to age or lack of maintenance, replacing them is essential for ensuring proper airflow throughout your home at all times. 

4 Relays & Capacitors: These small components are responsible for controlling electrical flow between certain components in an AC system like compressors and fan motors which helps maintain efficient operation as well as prevent overheating of certain parts among other things . If these get worn down due to wear-and-tear over time , they must be replaced immediately in order to avoid serious damage down the line . 

5 Thermostats : Thermostats control how often an AC unit turns on by regulating temperature levels within a space . If a thermostat malfunctions , an AC system may not turn on even when it’s needed which can lead to uncomfortable temperatures inside a home . In this case , replacing a thermostat is essential for restoring optimal performance levels within an AC system . 

Replacing any part of an AC system requires professional assistance since improper installation could lead to further problems or even permanent damage down the line so make sure you hire only experienced technicians who know what they’re doing before attempting any repairs yourself!
