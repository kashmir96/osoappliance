Air purifiers are a great way to keep your home’s air clean and free from allergens and pollutants. But do they work as well as an AC? The short answer is no, but they can still be an effective supplement to your AC system. 

Air purifiers can help reduce the amount of airborne particles in your home, such as dust, pollen, pet dander, and other allergens. They do this by using filters that capture the particles in the air, trapping them so they can't circulate throughout your home. This can help reduce allergy symptoms and improve indoor air quality. 

However, while air purifiers are great for removing airborne particles from the air, they aren't as effective at cooling the space like an AC unit would be. Air purifiers work best when used in addition to an existing cooling system. This combination will allow you to reduce temperature fluctuations while also improving indoor air quality by removing harmful contaminants from the air. 

Additionally, if you have allergies or asthma you may find that using an air purifier helps reduce symptoms due to its ability to remove harmful particles from the air. The effectiveness of this will depend on how often you use it and which filter type is used with it (HEPA filters are most recommended). 

Overall, while an AC unit will always provide better cooling than a standalone air purifier alone, adding one into your existing setup can still offer many benefits for those who suffer from allergies or asthma or who just want cleaner indoor air overall!
