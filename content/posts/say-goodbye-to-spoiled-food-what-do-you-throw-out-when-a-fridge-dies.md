## Parting Ways with Spoiled Food After Refrigerator Death
No one wants to think about the potential of their refrigerator dying and leaving them with a lot of spoiled food to deal with. But the reality is that eventually, all appliances reach the end of their lifespan and need replacing. Knowing what to do if your refrigerator dies can help you get back up to speed with your meal prep and avoid any unnecessary waste or mess from spoiled food.

When it comes to a refrigerator that has stopped working, the priority should be removing all of the foods that were in there. Some perishables may still be usable if they are just slightly warm, but it's recommended to assess each item and either use, donate, or discard it. If the food was frozen and has thawed, it should not be refrozen and should be discarded as a food-safety precaution.

It's best to leave any remaining cleanup up to a professional service technician. Many refrigerators have a condenser unit located on the back side and this should not be handled by the homeowner, as it requires special tools and training to take the unit apart. After it has been inspected and deemed unrepairable, an appliance recycling or disposal company should be contacted to handle the refrigeratorâ€™s removal and safe disposal. 

When it comes to saying goodbye to your old refrigerator, taking time to check for spoiled food, disposing of it safely, and leaving the remaining cleanup to a professional are all great steps to take.
