If you’re a fan of crossword puzzles, then you may have come across the clue “Laundry Appliance.” This is a pretty straightforward clue, but it can leave some puzzlers scratching their heads. So what exactly does “Laundry Appliance” mean?

Simply put, a laundry appliance is any device used to help with the process of washing clothes and linens. This typically includes washing machines, dryers, and irons. Washing machines are the most common type of laundry appliance and are used to wash clothing and linens in water with soap or detergent. Dryers are used to dry the washed items afterwards by blowing warm or hot air over them. Irons are used to remove wrinkles from clothing by pressing them with heat.

These three appliances are essential for keeping your wardrobe looking sharp and for getting your clothes clean without having to do all of the work manually. Laundry appliances help make household chores much easier and faster than if done by hand so they definitely deserve their crossword clue!
