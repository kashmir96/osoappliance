## Troubleshooting Error Code E08
Error codes are not only common among appliances, but they can also indicate a wide array of potential issues. Error code E08 is a particularly common problem that can affect many appliances, including washers, dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, and more. If you’re having an issue with your appliance, you may be wondering how to solve this error code. This blog post is your guide to troubleshooting error code E08.

First and foremost, the most important action to take when your appliance displays error code E08 is to disconnect power from the appliance and wait at least five minutes before restoring power. During this time, you can use the time to visually inspect the back of the appliance for any loose wiring or damaged components.

Once you've disconnected power and checked the wiring, you can attempt to reset your appliance. Each type of appliance has its own way of resetting, depending on the make and model, so try to refer to your owner’s manual or online service manual to find out the correct way to reset your appliance. Keep in mind that not all error codes can be solved by a simple reset, so if this method doesn't work you may need to seek further assistance.

Once you’ve reset your appliance and the E08 error code appears again, you can check to see if any recent updates were made to the unit. If any were made, try restarting your appliance and see if the error code returns. You may also want to see if the unit requires a repair or replacement of any parts. A qualified technician can help you determine which parts need to be replaced or repaired.

If an error code like E08 is recurring, and all of the steps above have not solved the problem, it may be time to contact a service technician for assistance. Highly trained technicians can diagnose the issue and advise the best action.

Troubleshooting error code E08 can be tricky, and may require the help of a professional. If your appliance isn’t performing as it should, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) to find the best appliance for your home.
