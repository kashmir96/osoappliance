As technology has advanced, so too has the commercial laundry industry. Commercial washing machines and dryers are now commonplace in laundromats, hotels, hospitals and other businesses that require large-scale laundry operations. These heavy-duty machines provide a reliable and efficient way to clean large amounts of laundry on a daily basis. 

Commercial washing machines are larger than residential models and can handle more clothing at once. They often come with special features such as automated settings for specific types of fabrics or adjustable temperature settings for different fabrics. Some commercial washers have built-in water filtration systems to ensure the quality of water used in washing is always clean and fresh. Additionally, most commercial washers have high spin speeds that allow clothing to be dried more quickly after being washed. 

Commercial dryers also differ from residential units in that they typically run on higher temperatures than home dryers to ensure clothing is dried more quickly and thoroughly. They also usually have larger capacity drums so that multiple items can be dried at once, which saves time and energy costs associated with running multiple drying cycles at home. Additionally, most commercial dryers come with sensors or timers which help conserve energy by automatically turning off the machine when itâ€™s finished its job or when a set amount of time has passed without any activity. 

Commercial washing machines and dryers offer businesses a reliable way to keep up with their laundry needs without having to sacrifice quality or efficiency in the process. By investing in a good quality commercial washer/dryer combo, businesses can rest assured knowing their cleaning needs will be met while saving both money and energy costs in the long run!
