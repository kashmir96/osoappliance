## Fixing Minor Chips with Whiteware Touch Up Paint

Nobody likes to see chipped dinner plates, but don't stress! It is possible to repair damaged dinnerware with white ware touch up paint. This guide will walk you through the steps of restoring your dinnerware to its original condition with a few simple supplies.

First, you're going to need a tube of touch up paint. This kind of paint is specifically designed for dinner ware and is available at most hardware stores. Make sure to pick the color that most closely matches your dinnerware. It is important to prepare the area to be painted first. Clean the plate with a mild detergent, wipe it down and make sure it's dry. Once you have everything ready, follow the instructions on the touch up paint tube.

Now, you can begin painting. Start by putting a thin layer of paint on one side of the chip. Wait until it is completely dry before adding a second coat of paint. Use long strokes and make sure to avoid layering the paint too much as this can decrease how well it attaches to the dinnerware. If necessary, you can also use sandpaper to smooth the repaired area after the paint has dried.

Allow the paint to dry completely before using the dinner plate again. Once youâ€™re finished, you should have your dinner plate looking as good as new! As an extra precaution, we recommend that you hand-wash the plate for the first few uses, as water can damage any paint job.

Repairing minor chips in dinnerware doesn't have to be difficult or expensive. With the right paint, elbow grease and a bit of patience, you can easily restore your dinner plates to their original condition. If you are having trouble with larger repairs or your dinnerware refuses to be revived, enlist the help of an appliance repair technician.
