We all rely on household appliances to make our lives easier, but most of us don’t think about how much energy these devices consume. It turns out, if you’re not careful, these necessary items can take up a large portion of your electricity bill. Depending on the appliance and how much it is used, its energy consumption can be significant.

The most energy-hungry appliance in the home is usually the refrigerator. Even though fridges are designed to be as efficient as possible, they still require a lot of electricity to keep food cold and fresh for long periods of time. The good news is that newer models are becoming increasingly more efficient and therefore less expensive to run. On average, refrigerators can consume up to 20 percent of a household’s total electricity consumption.

Another large consumer of energy in the home is the clothes dryer. Older models tend to use significantly more electricity than their newer counterparts due to improved efficiency standards put in place by governments and manufacturers alike. Clothes dryers can take up anywhere from 5-15% of total electricity consumption depending on usage frequency and type of model used (gas vs electric). 

Dishwashers are also big consumers when it comes to electricity use—especially those with heated drying cycles or higher temperature settings which require additional power usage during operation. Dishwashers typically take up around 8-10% of total electricity use; however this number can go up or down depending on cycle selection and water temperature setting used each time it is operated. 

Finally, washing machines have become more efficient over time due their improved design features such as lower water levels for each cycle selection or automatic balanced loads which reduce waste water usage per wash cycle. Washing machines typically account for 5-10% of total electrical use depending on size/model selected as well as number times per week it is operated by households members/residents living within home environment itself! 

Overall, there are many ways that you can reduce energy consumption from your household appliances without sacrificing convenience or comfort levels at all! By regularly cleaning lint filters in your dryer (to improve air circulation), using cold water washes when possible (to cut down heating costs) or investing in ENERGY STAR approved products with higher efficiency standards —you will be able to save money while helping protect our environment too!
