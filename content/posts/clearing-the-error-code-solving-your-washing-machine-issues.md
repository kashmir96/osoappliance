## Solving Washing Machine Errors with a Current Error Code

Nobody likes it when a washing machine breaks. Not only is it annoying having to wait days for a repairperson to arrive, but it usually ends up costing extra money in repairs. Thankfully, you can take the matter into your own hands and troubleshoot the washer yourself, sometimes even without calling a repairperson.

Most modern washing machines have digital error codes which will be displayed on their panel if they encounter a problem. By consulting the washing machine’s user manual, or our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/), you can decode the error code and take the necessary steps required to repair the issue.

It can be intimidating to take apart the washer and try to fix it, but don’t worry; basic repairs are not particularly complicated. Start by checking for any blockages, or residue build-up in the drainage or hoses. Additionally, check the water lines for any breaks or leaks. If the issue isn’t solved, then you may have to replace a specific part. Before purchasing the required components, however, our Glossary can provide recommendations on more specific parts, meaning you know exactly what you’re getting.

No matter the issue, understanding the errors displayed and being able to decode it is an important part of solving the problem. Doing so helps you save money and time on a appliance repair professional, potentially allowing you to get the machine working efficiently all on your own. 

If your washing machine is currently displaying an error code, don't panic. With our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary, you can quickly and accurately diagnose the issue, allowing you to get your washing machine up and running as soon as possible. So if you're in a bind, don't be afraid to give it a try.
