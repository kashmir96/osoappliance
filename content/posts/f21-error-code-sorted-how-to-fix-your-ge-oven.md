## Fixing the F21 Error Code on your GE Oven 
Are you having trouble with your GE oven and the dreaded F21 error code? Don't worry, you've come to the right place. This article will provide steps guiding you on how to diagnose and fix F21 error codes.

If your GE oven is displaying an F21 code, it means the oven is having an issue with the door latch motor. The oven thinks that either the door latch motor is constantly running even when the oven door is closed or that the motor isn't running when it should.

The most common fix to discharge this error code is as follows:

1. Check the wiring to make sure all circuits are properly connected.
2. Make sure all circuits are not damaged or loose.
3. Check the door latch motor and make sure the motor is properly connected and running.
4. If the motor is not running, it will need to be replaced.

The above are the most common issues that cause an F21 Error Code to display. If these steps do not solve the issue, then additional testing to the oven will be needed.
