2023 is an exciting time for stove technology. As technology advances and energy efficiency becomes more important, the latest stoves are designed to provide the highest quality cooking experience while also reducing energy costs. Here's a look at some of the features you can expect from a 2023 stove. 

1. Smart Controls - 2023 stoves will have advanced smart controls that allow you to monitor and manage your cooking from anywhere in your home. This means you'll be able to adjust temperature, cook times, and other settings remotely with just a few taps on your smartphone or tablet. 

2. Induction Cooking - Induction cooking is becoming increasingly popular due to its fast heating capabilities and energy efficiency compared to traditional gas or electric models. With induction cooking, heat is generated directly in the pan itself instead of being transferred through the air or surface elements like other types of stoves do. 

3. Self-Cleaning Ovens - Self-cleaning ovens use high heat to break down food residue without any scrubbing required on your part! This feature will save time during clean up and keep your oven looking fresh all year round with minimal effort involved on your part! 

4. Connectivity - Many 2023 stove models will be Wi-Fi enabled so they can connect directly with mobile devices like smartphones or tablets for even more convenience when it comes to controlling settings and monitoring progress during meal preparation sessions! With this type of connectivity, you'll be able to check in on dinner from wherever you might be – no need for running back into the kitchen every few minutes! 

 5 . Voice Control - The newest stoves have built-in voice control capabilities so that all you need do is speak out loud what temperature setting you want – no need for pushing buttons or twisting knobs anymore! 

 6 . Advanced Safety Features – Safety continues to remain paramount when it comes to home appliances like ovens and ranges; as such many 2023 models will come equipped with advanced safety features such as automatic shut offs if temperatures get too high as well as sensors that detect when something has been left burning too long inside them!

In conclusion, 2023 stove models are designed to provide the highest quality cooking experience with maximum efficiency and convenience. With their advanced technology, you'll be able to monitor your cooking from anywhere in your home, enjoy energy-saving induction cooking, take advantage of self-cleaning ovens, and more – all while saving time and money!
