Appliance repair and resale is an important part of home maintenance. Appliances are expensive and when they break, it can be a real hassle to get them fixed. Fortunately, there are a few options for appliance repair and resale that can help you save money. 

When an appliance breaks down, the first step is to diagnose the problem. This can be done either by a professional or on your own. If you decide to attempt repairs on your own, make sure you have all the necessary tools and parts required for the job before starting any work. However, if possible it is always recommended that you hire a professional technician who specializes in appliance repair as they will have more experience in identifying and repairing any problems with specific appliances.

Once the problem has been identified, it’s time to decide whether you want to fix or replace the broken appliance. Repairing an appliance can often be less expensive than replacing it but may not always be feasible depending on how extensive the damage is or if spare parts are unavailable or too hard/expensive to find. If replacement is necessary then there are several options available such as purchasing new from a retailer or buying used from an online marketplace like eBay or Craigslist where there are often good deals available on used appliances in working condition.. 

Finally, once you have decided whether to fix or replace your broken appliance, there may still be another option - appliance resale! Reselling unwanted appliances can often result in great savings compared to buying new as long as they’re in working condition and look presentable (eBay is again a great place for this). Appliance reselling is becoming more popular amongst those who don’t want the hassle of dealing with repairs but would still like some return on their investment into their original purchase by recouping some of their costs back through reselling at a discounted rate rather than throwing out their old items completely. 
 
In conclusion, when dealing with broken appliances there are several options available ranging from trying DIY repairs yourself through to hiring professionals for diagnosis/repair/replacement services right up until finally reselling them which could potentially generate some revenue back towards your original purchase price depending upon its condition & demand at time of sale!
