# Door seal come off washing machine

Does your washing machine door seal come off? If so, it’s likely that you’ve been experiencing problems with your washing machine. A door seal that has come off is not only a nuisance but can have a huge impact on the performance of your appliance and even cause unnecessary wear and tear to the internal components.

The primary purpose of a door seal is to maintain an effective seal between the drum, and the outside environment. This reduces energy consumption and helps keep moisture from entering your device, which is especially important for keeping mold at bay. It also prevents water from leaking out during the spin cycle, helping reduce noise levels as well as increase efficiency. 

When a door seal comes off it can ruin your machine, floor and much else if not repaired promptly. 

Fortunately replacing a door seal is relatively easy and cost-effective! Before getting started make sure that you've unplugged your appliance from its power source as well as emptied out all clothes or other items from inside of it first. Then take some time to familiarize yourself with how exactly the existing one fits onto its housing before taking it off—this will save you time and make installing your new part easier! You can even watch YouTube videos explaining the whole process from start to finish. 

Overall replacing a washing machine door seal isn't too difficult - just make sure that you take safety precautions while working on these types of tasks! If ever unsure then always consult with an experienced professional first before attempting anything yourself so they can help ensure no mistakes are made along way
