Making a milkshake using a milkshake maker is an easy and fun way to get your daily dose of creamy, delicious goodness. All you need is some ice cream, milk and a few other ingredients to create the perfect shake. Here are the steps for making the perfect milkshake in no time! 

1. Start by selecting your favorite type of ice cream. Choose from flavors like vanilla, chocolate, strawberry or even coffee if youâ€™re feeling adventurous. Make sure that the ice cream you choose is at room temperature so it blends easily with other ingredients.

2. Next, add your desired amount of milk into the milkshake maker pitcher along with 2-3 scoops of ice cream depending on how thick or thin you'd like it to be. 

3. If desired, add in any additional ingredients such as syrup or nutella for added flavor and texture. 

4 Place the lid onto the pitcher and switch on your milkshake maker machine and blend until you reach your desired consistency! The time it takes depends on what type of machine you have but usually it shouldn't take more than a minute or two to reach perfection! 

5 Once blended, pour into glasses and top off with whipped cream if desired for added sweetness before serving up this delicious treat! Enjoy!
