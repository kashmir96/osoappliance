## Uncovering What Your Samsung Dryer Symbols Mean
Wondering what all of the symbols and indicators on your Samsung dryer stand for? Trying to understand your Samsung dryer better can be confusing and sometimes vague. Look no further--we've compiled a list of common symbols used in Samsung dryers, so you can troubleshoot better and faster.

First, take a look at the buttons located on the control panel of your Samsung dryer. They should include symbols like steam, delay start, wrinkle care, and an Eco Mode. These symbols represent unique and convenient features that your model Samsung dryer offers. 

For example, the steam button will activate high temperature steam during the drying cycle to reduce wrinkles and odors. The Eco Mode is designed to minimize energy consumption. You can delay the start of your cycle by using the delay start button. The wrinkle care option may reduce wrinkling and result in less ironing.

If you check out the interior of your Samsung dryer, you will find two indicators; the child lock and the drying end indicator. The child lock feature is designed to prevent children from tampering with the dryer and its settings. The drying end indicator will illuminate when the dryer's cycle is complete.

Finally, take a look at the dryer's exterior. You should see LED lights, like a check filter light, an air-flow temperature light and a ventilation light. The check filter light will indicate when it is time to clean the lint filter. The air-flow temperature light blinks if the exhaust temperature is too high. If the exhaust temperature is normal, this light will remain as a solid light. The ventilation light will blink if there is something blocking the air-flow vents; this could be caused by something like lint buildup.

Now that you know the common symbols and indicators present on your Samsung dryer, you can now use it safely and effectively. But to make sure your appliance runs at its best over its lifetime, give it the care it needs. Keep up with regular maintenance and tune-ups to preserve optimal performance.
