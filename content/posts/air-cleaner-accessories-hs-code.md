Air cleaner accessories are essential components of air purifiers, which are used to filter air and improve air quality. Air cleaner accessories have a unique Harmonized System (HS) code that is used to identify them for international trade purposes. 

The HS code for air cleaner accessories is 85437090. This code includes a wide range of items such as filters, fans, motors, belts, and other parts used in the construction of an air purifier or other type of device that removes particles from the air. 

When it comes to purchasing or exporting air cleaner accessories internationally, it’s important to make sure that you use the correct HS code in order to ensure accurate classification and avoid any potential issues with customs authorities. The correct HS code also helps ensure that you pay the right amount of import duty on your purchase or export transaction. 

In addition to using an accurate HS code when trading internationally, it’s also important to keep track of any changes in the applicable regulations so that you can be sure your shipments comply with all applicable laws and regulations. This will help protect your business interests and ensure smooth transactions when trading globally. 


By understanding how Harmonized System codes work and familiarizing yourself with all applicable regulations when trading internationally, you can help make sure that your business transactions go as smoothly as possible while avoiding any costly mistakes related to incorrect classifications or other errors related to international trade law compliance.
