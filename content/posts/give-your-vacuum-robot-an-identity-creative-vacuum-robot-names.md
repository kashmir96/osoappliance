## Create a Fun and Creative Name for Your Roomba or Other Vacuum Robot 

Bored of vacuuming? With the latest robotic vacuum technology, it’s now possible to simply sit back and watch your cleaning machine get the job done for you. To make the experience more enjoyable, and perhaps even a little bit fun, it’s a good idea to give your vacuum robot an identity by giving it a creative and unique name. 

To get the creative juices flowing, why not take inspiration from movies or TV shows that feature robotic characters. If you’re a Star Wars fan, why not go with something like BB-8? If you prefer The Jetsons, you could go with something like Rosie or Rosey? If you’re a sci-fi nerd, why not choose something more robotic like I-Robot, KITT, or Cylon? 

Another route to take is to think of a name that reflects the function of your machine. Something that suggests the action of a cleaning vacuum such as The Hooverator, the Super Sucker, or the Vacuuminator. Or perhaps something that conveys the feeling of a fresh new space, such as Fresh Start, Clean Sweep, or Spotless. 

Whichever name you decide on, make sure it’s something that will bring a smile to your face, even when you’re stuck with the tedious task of vacuuming. You can also try to select something that you can yell out enthusiastically when it’s time to “wake up” your machine.

By giving your vacuum robot an identity, you’ll be able to take some of the monotony out of your weekly cleaning routine. Why not go ahead and have some fun by giving your vacuum a creative and unique name?
