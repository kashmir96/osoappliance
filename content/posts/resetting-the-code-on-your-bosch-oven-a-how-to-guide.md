## What You Need to Know To Reset Your Bosch Oven
We’ve all been there, your bosch oven has gone on the fritz displaying an error code that you don’t recognise. Don’t worry, resetting the code is easier than you might think if you follow the steps outlined in this how-to guide.

The first step is to identify the error code which is displayed on your oven. Every oven manufacturer has their own codes, so if you’re unsure, look up your specific code using our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). You can find advice on what the code means as well as how to reset it.

Once you have identified the error, it’s time to reset the code. This can be done in different ways depending on your oven. For example, some ovens will require you to press a certain combination of buttons and hold them for a few seconds in order to reset the code. Check the owner’s manual for your model to find out which buttons to press.

It's important to keep in mind that resetting the error code may not completely solve the issue. Depending on the type of error, there could be a more serious problem with your oven which cannot be solved by resetting the error code. If you continue to receive the same error code after reset it, the best option is to call in a professional.

In conclusion, resetting your Bosch oven's error code is relatively easy if you know where to look for assistance. Be sure to exercise caution when resetting the error code and always consult a professional if the error persists. To ensure your oven stays in optimal condition, use our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to stay up to date with potential error codes.
