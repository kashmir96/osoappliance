If you're looking for a dependable washing machine, the Electrolux brand should be at the top of your list. Not only are they known for their innovative designs, but they also offer top of the line performance and energy efficiency. In addition to these features, Electrolux washing machines come with a variety of features that make them stand out from other brands. Here’s why an Electrolux model is a great choice for your laundry needs.

1. Durability: The exterior design of an Electrolux machine is built to last and offers superior corrosion protection compared to other brands. This makes them a great choice if you live in an area with hard water or if you need your washer to last through multiple loads each week.

2. Energy Efficiency: All Electrolux models are Energy Star certified, which means they use less electricity than standard models and will save you money on your energy bills over time. Additionally, many Electrolux models feature adjustable water levels so you can customize each load according to how much water it needs and further reduce energy consumption. 

3. Innovative Design: Many of their machines feature advanced technology such as steam cycles that help remove stubborn stains without the need for harsh chemicals or extra scrubbing by hand. Additionally, some models have built-in sensors that detect when fabric softener needs to be added during the cycle so you don’t have to worry about forgetting it altogether! 

4. Versatility: With multiple size options available in both front-loading and top-loading configurations, there’s sure to be an Electrolux model that fits perfectly into any space - no matter how small or large it might be! Their machines also offer adjustable spin speeds so you can tailor each load according to what type of fabric is being washed (i.e., delicates versus heavy cottons). 

Overall, if you’re looking for a reliable brand name with innovative features and excellent energy efficiency ratings then look no further than an Electrolux washing machine!
