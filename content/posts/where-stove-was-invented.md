The invention of the stove is an important part of human history. It has allowed us to cook food in a more efficient manner, and has helped to shape the way we eat today. But where was the stove first invented?

The origins of the stove date back thousands of years. Ancient civilizations used open fires for cooking, which were often built into a central location in the home. This allowed for easy access to the fire and made it easier to regulate heat levels. Over time, these open fires evolved into clay ovens that were used throughout Europe and Asia during the Middle Ages. 

In 1642, German blacksmith Johann Georg Schnitzer is credited with inventing the modern stove, which featured a closed combustion chamber with adjustable air vents and an iron grate on top. This design allowed for improved efficiency by controlling air flow better than an open fire and providing better heat control. The design quickly spread across Europe, becoming popular in homes as well as public spaces such as inns and taverns. 

In 1728, French inventor Francois Cuvilliés designed a cast-iron stove that featured adjustable dampers for improved heat control and was more durable than Schnitzer’s original design. This model became popular in France and other parts of Europe during this time period. 

As technology advanced over the centuries, stoves became increasingly efficient and safer to use in homes around the world. Today there are many different types of stoves available on the market including gas stoves, electric stoves, induction stoves, wood-burning stoves and more. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on your needs but all have their roots in Schnitzer’s original design from 1642!
