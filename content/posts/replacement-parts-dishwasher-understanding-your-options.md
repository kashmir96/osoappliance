## Replacing Parts in a Dishwasher: An Overview

Keeping your dishwasher in good working order requires occasional maintenance, and replacing parts is sometimes necessary. There are a variety of options to consider when replacing a dishwasher part. Understanding the different types of parts available can help ensure you are using the best fit and most cost-effective solution.

One of the primary decisions to make is between using original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts or non-OEM parts. OEM parts are those that are direct from the manufacturer, while non-OEM parts are replacements that may be made by another company and is advertised to be compatible with the original product. Depending on the item, non-OEM parts may be substantially less expensive and offer equivalent quality, so it is important to consider both options when making a purchase. 

Another important factor to consider is whether the part you need is a consumable or a non-consumable item. Consumable items are those that wear out relatively quickly under normal use and must be replaced periodically. Dishwasher items such as seals, pumps and hose clamps are all considered consumable. Other items such as spray arms, filter assemblies, and door seals are considered non-consumable and have a longer useful life.
