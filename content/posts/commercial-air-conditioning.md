Commercial air conditioning is a critical component of many businesses today. From small shops to large office buildings, air conditioning is often necessary to keep employees and customers comfortable. But what exactly is commercial air conditioning, and how does it differ from residential systems?

Commercial air conditioning systems are designed to cool larger spaces than those found in homes. This means they must be more powerful and efficient than residential units. They typically feature multiple components such as compressors, condensers, evaporator coils, fans and ductwork. Commercial systems also tend to have more advanced features like zoning capabilities, variable speed motors and energy-saving settings.

In addition to cooling larger areas than residential units can handle, commercial HVACs are designed for long-term use in high-traffic areas. This means they can usually run longer hours without needing maintenance or repair as often as a residential system would need it. They also come with more advanced filters that help protect the indoor environment from particles like pollen or dust that could otherwise make the space uncomfortable or unhealthy for occupants.
 
Commercial HVACs are typically installed by experienced professionals who understand their complexity and need for frequent maintenance and repairs when necessary. Regular service visits should be scheduled at least once a year in order to keep the system running at peak efficiency levels so you don't experience any drop in performance or comfort levels during operation time periods when temperatures outside rise or drop significantly in your area of business operations . 
 
Having an efficient commercial HVAC system not only keeps your space comfortable but can also save you money on energy bills throughout the year by helping reduce energy consumption over timeâ€”a win-win situation!
