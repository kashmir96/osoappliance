Over the past decade, energy efficiency has become increasingly important for appliances. As energy costs continue to rise, energy ratings are becoming more important for buyers when choosing products.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently released new appliance energy ratings that will be implemented in 2021. This new rating system is designed to reflect the true operating costs of an appliance over its lifetime, including the cost of electricity and other factors such as maintenance and repair costs. The DOE’s goal is to provide consumers with more accurate information so they can make informed decisions about their appliance purchases.

The latest rating system takes into account a number of factors, including a product’s estimated annual energy usage, estimated annual operating cost, and estimated life cycle cost (including repair costs). It also evaluates features such as water saving features and noise levels when applicable. The new rating system also uses an easy-to-understand letter grade system from A+ to F that allows consumers to quickly compare different models side by side. In addition to this letter grade, each product will also have an associated number range that reflects the estimated operating cost over its lifetime (for example A+ = 0-40%). 

By using this new rating system, consumers can make more educated decisions about their appliance purchases based on how much energy they will use over its lifetime and how much it will cost them in the long run. This is especially helpful for those looking for appliances that are both efficient and cost-effective in order to save money over time while still providing quality performance. 

Overall, the updated appliance energy rating system provides consumers with valuable insight into their purchase decisions so they can make wise investments in their homes while also reducing their environmental impact by choosing products with lower yearly electricity costs and emissions levels than others on the market today.
