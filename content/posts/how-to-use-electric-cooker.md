Cooking with an electric cooker can be a great way to make delicious meals in the comfort of your own home. Whether you’ve just bought a new electric cooker or you’re just getting started using one, there are some basics that you should know in order to get the most out of your cooking experience.

First, familiarize yourself with all of the features on your electric cooker. Most electric cookers have a control panel, which will allow you to adjust settings such as temperature and cooking time. Make sure that you understand how each setting works and how it can affect the outcome of your meals. 

Second, prepare all of your ingredients before turning on the cooker. This includes chopping vegetables and measuring out spices or other ingredients if needed. This will help ensure that everything cooks evenly and that no ingredient is left behind or overcooked. 

Third, preheat your oven before putting any food into it so that it is at the correct temperature for when you begin cooking. You can also set timers on some models so that they automatically shut off after a certain amount of time has elapsed. 

Fourth, when placing food onto an electric hot plate or grill plate, make sure to leave enough space between items so they don’t stick together while cooking and don’t burn each other during flipping operations (if required). Moreover, try not to overcrowd items on one side because this could lead to uneven heating and poor results overall for certain dishes such as stir-fries or omelettes. 

Finally, keep an eye on what is happening inside the oven while it is running by observing through its glass window – this will help prevent any potential disasters from occurring! You should also be aware of what temperature settings are needed for different kinds of dishes so as to ensure successful outcomes every time! 

By following these simple steps when using an electric cooker, you should be able to create delicious meals in no time!
