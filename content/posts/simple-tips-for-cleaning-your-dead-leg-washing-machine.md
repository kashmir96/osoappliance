## Simple Tips for Maintaining Your Dead Leg Washing Machine

Having a reliable washing machine is invaluable for everyday life. Dead leg washing machines are one of the best models for cleaning large loads as quickly and efficiently as possible. To ensure your dead leg washer continues to deliver its best performance, here are some simple tips for keeping it clean.

First, it’s important to make sure the filter is regularly checked and cleaned. The filter helps trap lint, dirt, and other debris before it enters the drum of the machine. Without a clean filter, your wash performance will suffer. It’s also a great idea to vacuum the back of the washer, paying special attention to the area around the filter.

In addition, you should also clean the agitator. This component is responsible for getting the clothes clean and can develop a build-up of dirt and debris. To clean the agitator, use a soft scrub brush and a mild detergent. Be sure to rinse the agitator off properly with clean water and dry it with a non-abrasive cloth.

Finally, it’s important to regularly clean the interior of the washer too. This can be done by running a cycle with hot water and a few cups of white vinegar. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and will help dislodge any dirt or residue build-up. Be sure to check for any residual dust after the wash cycle is complete.

By taking these simple steps, you will help keep your dead leg washing machine in tip-top shape. It is always a good idea to have your machine serviced by a professional in order to keep it running as efficiently as possible.
