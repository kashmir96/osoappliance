## Streamlining Your Home Kitchen
A kitchen is the heart of any home––where meals are made, and family and friends come together. But, without the right layout and placement of appliances, time in the kitchen can be chaotic and overwhelming. To help you make the most of the time you spend cooking in your kitchen, let’s take a look at the basics of an efficient kitchen layout.

One of the first steps to creating an efficient kitchen layout is identifying both your primary and secondary workspaces. Your primary workspace will be where you do the bulk of your activity, like food prep and cooking. This is where you should place your refrigerator, countertop or stovetop, and sink. You will also want to create a secondary workspace, which should typically be near the dining area, for setting the table and plating meals for serving.

When looking to upgrade your kitchen appliances, be sure to research their energy and water efficiency ratings to both save money and further promote an efficient kitchen workflow. One of the most popular appliances in modern kitchens is the dishwasher. They aren’t just to replace humans washing dishes, but to also save time and energy. To minimize kitchen interruptions, you may also want to look at purchasing a range hood, which will clear your workspace of odors and smoke.

Finally, organization plays an essential role in helping you create an efficient kitchen layout. Cabinets and drawers should be located near your primary cooking area and equipped with necessary plates, pots, pans and utensils. Utilizing kitchen organizers and storage containers can also help you make the most of the space you have and get to cooking faster.

When planning the design of your kitchen, putting some thought into how it will function for you and your family will help maximize efficiency and minimize stress. Whether it’s researching energy efficiency ratings or implementing organization systems, there are plenty of ways to tailor your kitchen layout to best fit your lifestyle.
