## Cleaning Kitchen Appliances for a Lasting Shine 

Kitchen appliances are often a source of pride for homeowners. Not only are they the centerpiece of our stylish backdrops but they also help us accomplish everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, and entertaining. As such, keeping your kitchen appliances clean and in good working order is essential for upheld curb appeal and maintaining their lifespan. 

Cleaning kitchen appliances is not complicated, though there are a few rules of thumb you should keep in mind. First, never use abrasive materials like steel wool or industrial cleaning products when tackling kitchen appliances. These materials have an adverse effect on the costly finishes of your appliances and can even cause irreparable damage if not used with care. Second, use warm soapy water or gentle detergent to tackle grease, grime, and mildew. Whether you are tackling the exterior of your fridge or washing off your stove, always use a soft sponge or cloth to apply the solution and wipe away the dirt. 

For stainless steel appliances, consider using a stainless steel cleaner (typically found in stores) or use vinegar and a microfiber cloth to tackle stains or smudges. You can also make a paste with baking soda, water, and a few drops of dish soap to remove burnt on foods. Finally, never forget to take time to wipe away any moisture from your appliances as soon as you have finished cleaning them. If you let moisture sit for an extended period of time it can cause rusting and other damage. 

Cleaning your kitchen appliances is a great way to make sure they stand the test of time and look fresh. If you found this article helpful and would like more insights, check out our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for more tips and best practices.
