When it comes to washing machines, the larger the better. Bigger washers can handle more clothes in one cycle, saving you time and energy. In New Zealand, there are a variety of large washing machines on the market that are perfect for busy households. 

One of the best large washing machine models is Fisher & Paykel's 10kg WashSmart Top Load Washer. This model has a maximum spin speed of 1200rpm and is Energy Star certified for its excellent energy efficiency rating. It also features SmartDrive technology which ensures optimal wash performance using fewer parts and less water. The AquaTronic 4 system further works to save water by running only when it needs to, while the Delay Start function allows you to delay when your laundry starts so that it fits in with your schedule. 

Another great option for large families is Bosch's 9kg Serie 6 Washing Machine. This washer has an impressive 1400rpm maximum spin speed and an A+++ energy rating. It also features VarioPerfect technology which lets you choose between two programs: EcoPerfect or SpeedPerfect – allowing you to tailor your cycle according to how quickly or economically you need results! Additionally, this model comes with 15 pre-set programmes as well as a handy 24-hour delay start timer so that laundry can fit in with your lifestyle needs more easily. 

If you're looking for something even bigger than these two models, then Samsung's 12kg Ecobubble Washing Machine could be just what you need! This model offers up 1400rpm spin speed and an A+++ energy rating – making it one of the most efficient top loaders on the market today! Furthermore, this washer utilises Samsung’s Eco Bubble technology which mixes air and water together before entering into each load of clothes; resulting in a much gentler cleaning process while still ensuring superior results every time! Plus, this machine features a handy 15-minute Quick Wash programme should something emergency arise – making it ideal for busy households who don't always have time to wait around for their laundry cycles! 

 All in all, if you're after a large capacity washing machine then there are loads of great options available on the New Zealand market today; from Fisher & Paykel’s 10kg WashSmart Top Load Washer through Bosch’s 9kg Serie 6 Washing Machine all the way up to Samsung’s 12 kg Ecobubble Washing Machine - there really is something out there for everyone!
