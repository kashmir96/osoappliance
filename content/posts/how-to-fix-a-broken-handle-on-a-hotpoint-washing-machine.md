## Repairing a Broken Handle on a Hotpoint Washing Machine
Are you having problems with the handle on your Hotpoint washing machine? Don't despair! Broken handles on a washing machine may be inconvenient, but they can often be repaired. This article will give you some advice on how to go about it.

The first step is to identify the extent of the damage. If the handle has simply come loose and is showing signs of wear and tear, then you may be able to reattach the handle by simply tightening up the screws. If the handle is cracked or broken, then you will need to replace it.

Once you have determined the extent of the damage, you can start to look for a replacement. You can purchase a replacement handle from most hardware stores. Make sure you purchase one that is compatible with Hotpoint washing machines, as not all handles will fit.

The next step is to remove the existing handle. First, disconnect the power and water supplies to the machine. Then, unscrew the handle from the appliance. Once the handle is removed, you can transfer the screws to the new handle.

Before you can attach the new handle, you may need to replace or tighten up any loose screws on the door. Then, you can reattach the handle and secure it with the screws. Make sure it is securely fastened before switching the power and water supplies back on.

Once reattached, the handle should be securely in place and your Hotpoint washing machine should be back in working order.
