## Unpacking Electrolux Washing Machine Error Symbols
Do you have a new or existing Electrolux washing machine but don't know how to interpret the error messages? You're not alone, as it can be confusing to understand the symbols and options. Even if you have the manual, it may not provide a full explanation of the problem. In this article, we will explain the various error symbols and provide options for what action to take when they appear.

When you see an error symbol appear on your washing machine it usually indicates a specific problem with the unit or the cycle you are trying to run. It's important to be able to accurately diagnose the issue in order to take the appropriate action. Common error symbols for Electrolux washing machines include an E20 and E21.

The E20 symbol error indicates that the washer is not able to drain the water from the machine and there is a blockage in the drain filter or hose. To resolve this issue, you should check to ensure that the filter or hose is not clogged and that the drain pump is running properly. You can also try checking the drain hose to make sure it is properly connected to the drainpipe. If the issue persists, you may need to contact a technician for further help.

The second error code, E21, indicates that the washer is unable to fill with water properly and could indicate an issue with the water supply such as a kinked or blown hose, or an issue with the valve that controls the water intake and distribution. To fix this issue, you should check the hoses and water valve for any possible problems. If the issue persists, you may need to contact a technician for further help.
