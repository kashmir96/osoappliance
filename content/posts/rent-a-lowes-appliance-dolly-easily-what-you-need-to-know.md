## Rent Lowes Appliance Dolly Easily - Learn What You Need to Know

If you’re in need of an appliance dolly for your next move, renting one from Lowes can be a great option. An appliance dolly is an essential tool for moving large and/or heavy appliances like washing machines, refrigerators, and stoves. Traditional rental companies are often required to charge high prices for short rental periods, making appliance dollies expensive to rent. Lowes, however, provides a cost-effective way to rent an appliance dolly.

When renting an appliance dolly from Lowes, you’ll need to decide which size dolly to rent. Lowes offers dollies in four different sizes, ranging from a small 4’x2’x2’ dolly to a large 4’x4’x4’ dolly. Each dolly has two handles for easy maneuvering and are designed for easy loading and secure transport of your household appliances. It’s important to know the approximate weight and size of your appliance in order to choose the right size dolly.

Once you’ve chosen the right size appliance dolly, you’ll need to make arrangements to pick up the dolly and return it when you’re done. Most Lowes stores have rental desks where you can pick up and return the dolly. You’ll need to provide a valid driver’s license, your name and address, and a valid credit card to rent the dolly. The cost of a rental depends on the size and length of your rental, so be sure to ask about rental prices when you pick up the dolly.

Finally, once you’ve returned the dolly, make sure that you receive a receipt as proof of return. You may be asked to pay an additional fee if the dolly is damaged or not returned to the store on time.

Lowes offers an easy, cost effective way to rent an appliance dolly for your next move. Be sure to choose the right size dolly for your needs, make arrangements to pick up the dolly, and return it in a timely manner to get the best rental experience.
