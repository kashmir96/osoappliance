## Quickly and Easily Solving Household Heater Problems

Homeowners who rely on a heater to keep their home warm in cold weather may run into issues from time to time. Fortunately, many common heater problems can be resolved on your own in just a few easy steps. 

If your home's heater is not turning on when you attempt to start it, the first thing to check is the thermostat. To do this, turn the thermostat up to the highest level and ensure both the cooling and warming functions are turned off. Sometimes a malfunctioning thermostat may cause your heater to stop functioning altogether. 

If the thermostat seems to be fine, the next thing to check is the pilot light, particularly in gas-powered heaters. Make sure the light is lit and the flow of gas is increasing. The light can be lit manually with a match if need be. It may also be a good idea to remove any debris from around the heater, as this can sometimes prevent the pilot light from working correctly. 

Next, check the exhaust for blockages. In many cases, problems with the heater can be caused by the buildup of lint or other debris blocking the exhaust, in particular that of a condensing heater. Make sure you thoroughly clean the area and inspect the pipes to ensure they are cleared of any blockages.

Finally, if all else fails, it may be necessary to inspect the heater itself. In some cases, worn out motor bearings or failing insulation can lead to problems with it turning on or functioning properly. 

In any case, before attempting to repair your heater, it is important to ensure you understand the risks and take all proper safety precautions. If in doubt, it may be best to hire a professional to inspect your heater and make the necessary repairs.

## Common Heater Problems and Solutions

**Q1: How do I tell if my heater needs repairs?**

The best way to tell if your heater needs repairs is to check for any strange noises coming from the unit, such as humming, clanging, or banging. Additionally, you may notice that your heater is costing you more on energy bills or that the air coming out does not seem as warm as expected. 

**Q2: How can I identify a faulty thermostat?**

A faulty thermostat may cause your heater to not turn on, to cycle on and off frequently, or to not produce heat evenly throughout the area. You can also test the thermostat by setting it to a higher temperature than the current one, to see if your heater kicks on.

**Q3: What can cause a burner flame to be yellow?**

A yellow burner flame usually means that the combustion process is not efficient and that your heater is producing too much carbon monoxide. This issue can be caused by a number of things such as a blocked chimney or vent, a lack of oxygen, incorrect burner adjustment, or lack of a flame arrestor.

**Q4: What should I do if my heater is not producing enough heat?**

The most likely cause of this issue is clogged air filters, which restrict the air flow and make it hard for the heater to produce enough heat. To solve this, you should check and replace your heater’s air filters regularly. If the problem still persists you should have your unit inspected by an HVAC technician. 

**Q5: How do I know it is time to replace my heater?**

If your heater unit is more than 15 to 20 years old, is in need of frequent repairs, is costing you more to run than expected, or is no longer providing reliable heat, then it might be time to replace your unit.
