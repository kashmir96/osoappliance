When deciding on a new kitchen appliance, it is important to understand the difference between a fridge and a freezer. The two appliances are similar in that they both use cold air to help keep food fresh; however, they serve two very different purposes. 

A refrigerator is mainly used to store and keep food fresh. It uses an insulated compartment with a temperature that is just above freezing point, usually around 38째F (3째C). This ensures that most bacteria will not grow, while keeping food from spoiling too quickly. Some refrigerators also feature humidity control settings which further helps to prolong the shelf life of stored items. 

A freezer, on the other hand, is designed to keep food frozen at temperatures below 0째F (-18째C). This low temperature prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from growing on frozen food and keeps it safe for consumption over long periods of time. Freezers are typically used for storing frozen goods that can be cooked at any time such as ice cream, meat, vegetables and more. 

In conclusion, fridges and freezers serve different purposes in the kitchen but have similar functions when it comes to preserving food for longer periods of time. While fridges are great for storing perishable items such as dairy products or pre-cooked meals; freezers are much better suited for storing frozen items such as ice cream or meats over longer periods of time without them going bad.
