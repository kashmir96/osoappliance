## Identifying and Resolving Compressor Issues in Your Air Conditioner 

It’s hot outside and you’re relying on your air conditioner to keep your home cool, but suddenly, it’s not working. You’ve noticed that there is an issue with the compressor as it struggles to turn on and off. Don’t panic, with some simple steps and an understanding of your air conditioner, you’ll be able to identify and resolve the compressor issue. 

The most common symptoms of a broken compressor are reduced cooling, insufficient air circulation, and loud and erratic noise. The compressor is the heart of the air conditioner, it pumps the refrigerant gas through the system, cools it, and circulates it throughout your home. 

The first step is to check the air filter, as a clean air filter allows air to flow freely. If your air filter is dirty, simply replace it. Another possible cause of a broken compressor is an imbalanced blower wheel, this can cause friction in the blower motor which can in turn damage the pump’s pulley and impeller. 

If this is the case, it is best to call an experienced technician who can analyze and make the necessary repairs. It is possible that malfunctioning components need to be replaced, such as the drive motor, the compressor, or the capacitor. Your technician will be able to give you a more in-depth understanding of what is wrong and what the best solution is for your air conditioner.
