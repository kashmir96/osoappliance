## Is Repairing LG Washers Expensive?
When it comes to buying a reliable, long-lasting washing machine, LG is often the brand that comes to mind. But do the higher costs of repair associated with LG washers make them a bad choice? Read on to get an insight into how much it might cost to repair an LG washer. 

The cost to repair an LG washing machine varies widely depending on the type of repair needed and the parts required. Common repair issues include a leaking water pump, a broken door latch, or a broken drum belt. With a professional repair service, a minor problem can often be fixed for under $100. More complicated problems can be more expensive, however, such as a rarer issue with the motor or control board. 

Fortunately, LG customers have access to some options to help make LG washer repairs more manageable. Many LG washers come with a warranty that covers labor and/or parts related to any defects in the machine. Depending on the model, the warranty may also include repairs for issues that may occur outside of the manufacturer's control. If the problem is covered by the warranty, the repair costs should be covered. 

In addition, many LG washer owners may be eligible for extended service contracts. This can be a great way to lower the cost of repair since the nature of the repair and part costs can be more predictable. These extended service contracts can add up to a significant savings over time.

Overall, the cost of repair for an LG washer can vary greatly, but fortunately there are options for LG customers to make repairs more affordable.
