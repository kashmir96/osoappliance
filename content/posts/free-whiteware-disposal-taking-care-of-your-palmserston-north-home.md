The City of Palmserston North has put together a free whiteware disposal program designed to ensure that all items that can no longer be used are disposed of safely and responsibly. The program 'provides a safe, permanent disposal solution for whiteware items that have reached the end of their useful life' such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, ranges and other small household appliances. 

When you need to dispose of a whiteware item, the company will come to your home and take the item away for free. They will then assess the item to determine if it is still useable, and if it is, they will donate it to a local charity. If the item is not useable, it will be properly recycled and disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner. This helps to reduce the amount of waste that goes into our landfills, while still providing a convenient and safe way to dispose of unwanted whiteware items.
