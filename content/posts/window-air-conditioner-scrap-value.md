Window air conditioners are a great way to cool down a room in any season of the year. However, when the time comes to replace them with a newer model, many people wonder what their scrap value might be. The short answer is that it depends on a variety of factors, including the age and condition of the unit.

To determine the scrap value of your window air conditioner, you should first assess its current state. If it’s in good working order, then you may be able to find someone who is willing to buy or trade for it as-is. Alternatively, if it’s damaged or doesn’t work properly anymore, then you can take it apart and sell off individual parts that still have some value. This could include anything from motors and compressors to fan blades and capacitors.

Another factor that influences the scrap value of window air conditioners is the age of the unit. Older models tend to have less reusable parts than newer ones due to advances in technology over time. For instance, an older model might not have energy efficient features like modern units do, so they would be less likely to fetch much money as scrap pieces.

Finally, where you decide to sell your window air conditioner can also impact its scrap value significantly. Local recyclers may be willing to pay more for bulk amounts than an individual buyer would offer for just one unit’s worth of components; however, if there’s not enough demand in your area for used AC parts then you may end up getting less money overall by selling off individual pieces online or at yard sales instead. 

The exact scrap value of your window air conditioning unit will vary depending on all these factors mentioned above; however, most people can expect anywhere between $30 – $100 depending on how well they manage their sale process and who they choose as buyers/traders
