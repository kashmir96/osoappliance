Air purifiers are essential for maintaining a healthy indoor environment, especially in homes with allergies or asthma. Unfortunately, like any other appliance, air purifiers can malfunction and require repair. To properly fix an air purifier, you’ll need to identify the problem and then purchase the correct parts to complete the repair. Here’s a look at some of the most common air purifier repair parts you may need.

1. Filters: Air filters are one of the most commonly replaced parts when it comes to air purifier repairs. Depending on your model, you may need to replace both pre-filters and true HEPA filters. It’s important to check your manufacturer’s recommendations for filter types and sizes before ordering new filters online or at a local store.

2. Fans: Fans are responsible for pushing air through your air purifier as it cleans it. If your fan is not working correctly, then you’ll need to replace it in order to get your unit running again properly. You should pay attention to size specifications when ordering a new fan – make sure that you get one that fits in the available space within your unit! 

3. Motors: Motors power fans so if yours isn't working correctly then you'll need to replace it too! The type of motor required will vary based on the model of your air purifier so make sure that you read up on what type is necessary before ordering a replacement online or from a store near you! 

4. Belts: Belts help keep motors running smoothly so if yours is worn out or broken then this could be causing issues with how well your motor functions - meaning that it's time for a new belt! Again, make sure that you research what type of belt works best with which model before purchasing one online or picking up from an auto shop near by! 

5. Sensors: Sensors control how much power goes into fans and motors as well as other components within an air purifier system, such as UV lights or ionizers if they're present in yours too! If these sensors aren't functioning correctly then replacing them can help ensure that all components continue operating properly once again - just be sure to double-check which type works best for their specific model first before buying any replacements online! 

With these five common parts available for purchase online and at stores near by, fixing up an old or malfunctioning air filter shouldn't be too difficult at all - just make sure that each part ordered is compatible with its respective model beforehand so nothing gets wasted during installation either way!
