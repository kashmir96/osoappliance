## Look Out for Error Codes on Your GE Profile Oven
Having an oven can provide you with many benefits, from delicious roasted dinners to perfectly toasted bread. But if something goes wrong and an error displays on your oven's control panel, it can be a confusing experience. In this article, we'll explore some common error codes you may find on your GE Profile Oven, and what you should do if you come across them. 

The most common error codes on your GE Profile Oven are E000 and F128. E000 typically indicates an issue with the control system in your oven, while F128 often means a problem with the fan or temperature sensor. If you experience either of these codes, it's a good idea to unplug your oven right away and contact a qualified repairperson. Not only will they be able to diagnose the issue, but they can also identify any potential safety risks that may have arisen in the oven.

If you have an error code like E013 or E022 that appears, it can mean an issue with the cooling fan. E013 is an indication of a malfunction within the cooling system, while E022 indicates an electrical connection error within the fan. In both of these cases, it’s important to unplug your oven as soon as possible and contact a trusted repair person for further evaluation.

If you have an error code like E001 or E011 appear on your screen, this could be an indication that the oven isn’t heating properly. E001 is an indication of a faulty heating element or thermostat, while E011 can mean that the oven isn’t reaching the correct temperature. If you experience either of these codes, you'll want to unplug your oven and contact a qualified repairperson for further evaluation.
