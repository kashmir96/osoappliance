A mini-split heat pump is a great way to heat and cool your home, but it’s important to consider the many accessories that can be used with a mini-split system. Accessories can help you customize your system for maximum energy efficiency, comfort, and convenience.

The first accessory to consider is an air handler. An air handler helps move heated or cooled air from the outdoor unit into the indoors. It also helps filter out dust and other allergens from the air. An air handler can also help reduce noise levels in your home.

Another accessory that can be used with a mini-split system is a ductless vent cover. This type of cover helps keep debris out of the outdoor unit while still allowing proper airflow throughout your home. It also protects against drafts and reduces sound levels outside your home as well as inside it.

A third accessory that may be useful with a mini-split system is an indoor temperature sensor. This device senses changes in temperature within your home and adjusts the heating or cooling output accordingly, keeping you comfortable year round without wasting energy unnecessarily by overcooling or overheating space unnecessarily during different times of day or night when temperatures fluctuate drastically outside of peak hours for heating/cooling needs in homes that use geothermal power sources like ground source heat pumps as part of their energy source mix.. 

Finally, many people choose to install zone control systems with their mini-split systems in order to further customize their climate control needs throughout their homes. Zone control systems allow homeowners to divide their homes into multiple zones so they can adjust temperatures within each zone separately for greater energy efficiency and comfort levels throughout the entire house all year long! 

Overall, there are many accessories available for mini-split systems that can help customize them for maximum efficiency, comfortability, and convenience! If you’re considering installing one in your home, make sure you look into all these options so you get exactly what you need!
