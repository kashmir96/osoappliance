Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular for people who want to improve their indoor air quality. While these devices are great for improving the air in your home, they can also have an impact on your electric bill. So how much of an effect do air purifiers have on your electric bill?

An air purifier is essentially a electric motor and fan that sucks in air from your home, passes it through a filter, and then exhausts the cleaner air back into the room. This process requires electricity to power the motor and fan, and this energy use will show up on your monthly electricity bill. However, how much the device affects your electric bill will depend on several factors including size of the unit and how often you use it. 

Most mid-size units will consume between 30 and 80 watts of power when running at full capacity. If you're using one of these models every day for 8 hours a day, you're looking at an additional 240-640 watt-hours per day or 7200-19200 watt-hours per month added to your electricity consumption. This could equate to anywhere from a few extra dollars each month to as much as $20 or more depending on where you live and what kind of rate you have with your utility company. 

That being said, there are ways that you can minimize the impact that an air purifier has on your electricity bill by using it wisely: 
* Avoid running it for too long - if possible limit its use during peak hours when energy rates may be higher 
* Use smaller units - larger units can draw more power than smaller ones so try opting for a model with less capacity if possible 
* Keep filters clean - dirty filters can cause motors to work harder which increases energy consumption 
* Set timers - if available set timers or motion detectors so that it only runs when needed 
* Buy Energy Star models â€“ Energy Star certified products are designed to be more efficient which helps reduce energy usage (and costs!). 

 By following these tips as well as opting for Energy Star certified products whenever possible, you can minimize the impact that an air purifier has on your electricity bill while still enjoying all its benefits!
