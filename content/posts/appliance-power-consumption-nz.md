As a homeowner, you are likely aware of the impact of energy consumption on your energy bills. From lighting to heating and cooling, our appliances play a major role in determining how much energy we use and how much our bills cost. By understanding the power consumption of common household appliances, you can make more informed decisions about when to use them and when to turn them off.

In New Zealand, there are two main sources of electricity: grid-connected electricity (also known as mains power) and self-generated electricity. Grid-connected electricity is delivered from a centralised source such as a power station or wind farm, whereas self-generated electricity is generated from alternative sources such as solar panels or hydroelectricity. 

When it comes to appliance power consumption in New Zealand, there are three main types: active (or running) power; standby (or idle) power; and peak demand charges. Active Power refers to the amount of electrical energy that an appliance uses while it is switched on and running - for example, the amount used by an electric stovetop for cooking or by a washing machine when washing clothes. Standby Power is the amount used while an appliance is turned off but still plugged in - this could include televisions or computers that are left on standby mode instead of being fully powered down after use. Peak Demand Charges refer to additional fees associated with using high amounts of electrical energy at certain times during peak hour periods - this could include using multiple high wattage appliances at once during peak hours such as dinner time in households with several people living together e.g., multiple ovens being used at once etc.. 

It’s important to note that not all appliances will consume the same amount of active or standby power – different models may have different ratings depending on their age/make/model etc.. To get an accurate estimate for your own home’s specific appliance usage rate, you can contact your local electrical supplier who should be able to provide you with details regarding each individual appliance’s maximum wattage rating along with any applicable peak demand charges associated with its usage.. 

By understanding the different types of electrical energy consumed by each individual appliance within your home, you can make informed decisions about which ones should be switched off completely after use vs ones which require minimal standby use such as televisions etc… This knowledge can also help guide your decision making process if considering investing in more efficient models – ultimately resulting in reduced total costs associated with household maintenance over time!
