When it comes to laundry, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It all depends on the size of your family, the volume of laundry you generate, and your budget. Commercial washing machines are great for large businesses that need to process a lot of laundry in a short amount of time. However, they are not ideal for home use due to their larger size and cost.

Commercial washing machines come in sizes ranging from 17kg all the way up to 70kg and are designed specifically for industrial use. They are typically much more durable than residential washing machines but also come with a much higher price tag. The added features that make them suitable for industrial use such as heavy duty construction and extra capacity often don't justify the cost for home use.

A better option for home use is a large 16kg residential machine. These washers have enough capacity to handle large loads while still being small enough to fit in most homes. They offer features like adjustable water levels, adjustable spin speeds, delayed start options, and energy efficient settings that help reduce utility bills over time. Plus they come at a much lower price point than commercial washers making them more affordable for most households. 

Overall, when choosing a washing machine for your home it's important to consider both size and cost before making a final decision. While commercial washers can be beneficial in certain situations they aren't always the best choice when it comes to typical household needs due their larger size and expense factor compared to residential models like the 16kg capacity washing machine which offers far greater value without compromising on performance or features.
