## Fixing a Faulty Washing Machine Agitator

Are you looking for a way to get your washing machine agitator moving again? Washing machine agitators are the rotating elements of a washing machine that help to remove dirt and stains. A malfunctioning agitator can render your washing machine useless - leaving you to find a way to repair it.

The first step to fixing a broken washer agitator is to identify the problem. If the agitator grinds as it turns, then you likely have something in the mechanism earlier causing a problem. This is usually caused by a clothing item that has become tangled in the agitator. You should inspect it carefully for any debris or congealed fabric softener. If found, carefully remove it and try the washer again.

If the issue is not caused by a tangle, you’ll need to take a closer look at the agitator. If the belt connected to the agitator has become loose, it should be tightened. If the belt is cracked or frayed, it should be replaced. It’s important that you also check any electrical connections connected to the agitator as they may have slipped loose. 

You should also make sure the plastic bearings located within the washer’s agitator haven’t worn out. If they have, they should be replaced. The bearings and belt can be replaced easily at home but if you’re feeling inexperienced, it’s best to hire a professional appliance repair technician. Hiring an experienced repair person is the best way to ensure the job has been done right.

Fixing a broken washing machine agitator can take some time, but it’s worth the effort to keep your washer running in tip-top shape. With a few simple steps, most problems can be resolved quickly.
