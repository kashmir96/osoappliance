## Fixing a Locked Washing Machine

Few things can bring a household to a standstill quite like a broken washing machine. A common problem is when the machine won’t open. Without the ability to open the door, you’re not able to access your laundry, and the whole situation feels helpless and out of control. Fortunately, however, you might be able to fix it—without the help of a repair technician.
 
### Reasons for a Locked Washing Machine

The washing machine lock, or lid lock, is designed to keep the washer lid from opening, and to protect people from getting injured while the washer is in the process of agitating, filling or draining. Some washers are programmed to lock if the cycle is unexpectedly interrupted, or if there is a power outage during the cycle.

The most common reason for the washing machine to remain locked is that it may have simply overflowed with water. If the water has not drained, the lock may remain in place. Alternatively, the lock itself may be broken for mechanical reasons, especially if it is an older model.

### How to Fix a Locked Washing Machine

If the washing machine has become locked as a result of overflowing, the best course of action is to open the filter and see if it needs cleaning. If so, run the washing machine again to get rid of all the water and allow it to cycle until the end. Another way to get rid of the water is to simply unplug the appliance and tilt it slightly toward the drain to empty out anything that has been left behind.

If the lock is broken, then you will need to replace it. You may be able to find replacement parts online, or look for a universal part kit. If it is an older model, you may need to refer to the owner’s manual to identify the correct part.

### Conclusion

A locked washing machine can be a serious household problem, but one that may be easier to fix than you think. Simply clean the filter, unplug the appliance and drain out any excess water, or replace the lock if necessary.
