Learning air conditioning doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With the right resources and a bit of dedication, anyone can become an air conditioning expert in no time. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Familiarize yourself with the components of an air conditioner: Knowing how the system works is key to understanding how it functions. So make sure you’re familiar with all the parts and their purpose, including the compressor, condenser, refrigerant lines, evaporator coil and blower motor.

2. Understand basic principles of thermodynamics: To truly understand how an air conditioner works, you must understand thermodynamics – specifically heat transfer and energy conservation laws. Learn about these topics in detail by reading textbooks or online materials devoted to them 

3. Study up on electrical wiring diagrams: Electrical wiring diagrams are essential for troubleshooting any problems that may arise in your air conditioner’s operation. You should also learn about safety procedures when working with electrical systems so you don’t put yourself at risk while working on your AC unit 

4. Take a course or attend workshops related to HVAC systems: There are plenty of courses available for those wanting to learn more about air conditioning systems and gain hands-on experience in installing and maintaining them 

5. Practice makes perfect: The only way to really get good at working on AC units is with practice – so don’t be afraid to start tinkering! Find an old unit that has been decommissioned but still has all its parts intact so you can get a feel for taking apart and troubleshooting different components 

 With these tips in mind, anyone can take their knowledge of air conditioning systems from zero to hero! Good luck!
