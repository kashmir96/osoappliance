## Protecting Your Home from Heater Risk

Heaters are an important component of most homes in cold climates. They provide a much needed source of warmth and comfort. However, they also come with the risk of fire and carbon monoxide poisoning if they are not properly operated and maintained. This blog explains the steps you can take to protect your home from the risk of heaters.

It is important to purchase your heater from a reputable dealer, preferably one that is certified by a national standards organization. Ensure you buy a heater which meets safety requirements, is appropriate for the size of your home, and is certified to be energy efficient. Make sure you diligently follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation and maintenance.

Regularly inspect your heater for any loose or damaged wiring, or any other component that is not working properly. Check the exhaust vent regularly to make sure it is not blocked by debris or other materials. It is essential for the safe operation of your heater. Additionally, it is important to check your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors regularly and change the batteries when necessary.

Finally, make sure to hire a qualified and certified technician to service your heater annually. This will help ensure it is operating safely and efficiently. Doing this will help protect your family from potential fires or carbon monoxide poisoning.
