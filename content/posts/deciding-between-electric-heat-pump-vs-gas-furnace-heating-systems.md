## Comparing Electric Heat Pump vs Gas Furnace Heating Systems

Many homeowners are often faced with the difficult decision of choosing between electric heat pump and gas furnace heating systems. Both of these options come with different pros and cons, so it is important to understand the difference between the two in order to make an informed decision. In this blog, we will compare the two systems and discuss the factors to consider when selecting heating system. 

Electric heat pumps are a more efficient form of heating. Heat pumps extract heat from the outside air and bring it inside, greatly reducing energy consumption and costs. On the other hand, furnaces burn a fuel like natural gas, oil, or propane which produces heat. The downside of gas furnaces is that they are not as energy efficient as electric heat pumps and can be more expensive to operate over time. 

Another factor to consider when choosing a heating system is the climate. Heat pumps work best in mild climates, but can struggle in areas with long, cold winters. Gas furnaces, on the other hand, are reliable in cold temperatures and can be a better choice for those who live in colder climates. Installation and maintenance are also important to consider when selecting a heating system. Heat pumps can be more expensive to install compared to a gas furnace and require more frequent maintenance.

At the end of the day, the decision of which heating system to choose is up to you. Consider your current energy costs, climate, installation and maintenance costs, and future energy savings to make the best decision for your home.
