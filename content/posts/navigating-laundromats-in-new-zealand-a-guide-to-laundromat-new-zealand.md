## Navigating Laundry Services in New Zealand

Laundry services can be quite confusing for those who are new to New Zealand. Whether you’re a traveler, student, or family living in the country, understanding the dos and don’ts of a New Zealand laundromat can be crucial to making sure you know what you’re getting yourself into.

When visiting a New Zealand laundromat, it’s important to know that you must pay cash and coins as you go. Most laundromats also have a customer service desk for assistance, and a selection of laundry supplies for sale. Different types of machines such as front loaders, top loaders and auxiliary machines are available in some locations. You can also pay extra for a wash-and-fold service; ask the customer service desk for details.

The majority of New Zealand laundromats use LaundryCoin, which is a digital payment system that keeps track of how much money has been spent on each laundry transaction. LaundryCoin is used in most New Zealand coin-operated vending machines, including laundromats. However, it’s important to remember that not all laundromats accept LaundryCoin, so check with the customer service desk ahead of time.

In terms of washing and drying cycles, laundromats in New Zealand typically have at least four wash cycles and five dry cycles. It’s important to make sure the doors to the washer and dryer are left open after use in order to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold. Additionally, always separate dark and light-coloured items for optimal results.

Overall, New Zealand laundromats are easy to navigate once you understand the basics. Whether you’re visiting or staying for a longer period, knowing the ins and outs of a New Zealand laundromat can be extremely helpful.
