## Restoring Your Washing Machine Back To Working Order
Is your washing machine not operating to its fullest capacity? Are you thinking of replacing it? Before you do, consider the possibility that you can revive your dead washing machine with some effort, time and a few tips. 

The first step to diagnostic investigations is to inspect the primary source of the problems. Check the power supply. Is the power cable firmly connected to the machine? Is the wall plug properly inserted into the electrical outlet? Is there power going to the machine? 

If these checks are completed positively, it is then important to change the usage settings of the machine. Run the washing cycle at a lower temperature, or a longer cycle. This will help to monitor the deteriorating or improving visible effect on the situation. 

Inspect the detergent capsules used to provide added cleaning ingredients. Old or expired soap might be causing this malfunction. Make sure the detergent capsule is appropriate for the load size and washing machine style. 

Finally, check for any leakage or blockages that might have occurred. This would include visually inspecting any valves, pipes or other situations of water discharge. If you identify a blockage, make sure to clean this area or call a professional for help.

In conclusion, take the time to consider the potential of reviving your dead washing machine. You could save yourself money and waste by taking the initiative of performing some investigative inspection and perhaps some simple maintenance.
