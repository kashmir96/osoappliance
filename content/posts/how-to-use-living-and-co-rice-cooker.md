The Living & Co Rice Cooker is a great kitchen tool that allows you to quickly and easily cook rice in minutes. With the Living & Co Rice Cooker, you can make fluffy, perfectly cooked rice with little effort. Here are some simple steps to get started:

1) Measure out the amount of rice you need for your meal. For one cup of uncooked rice, measure out two cups of water in a measuring cup and pour it into the cookerâ€™s inner pot.

2) Add your desired amount of uncooked rice (white or brown) into the inner pot. Make sure the water covers all of the rice so that it cooks evenly.

3) Close the lid tightly and press down on the start button once to begin cooking your rice. The cooker will automatically switch off when it is done cooking, usually taking about 20 minutes. 

4) When the cooker switches off, open up the lid and fluff up your cooked rice with a fork before serving! 

 By following these easy steps, you should be able to cook delicious meals with ease using your Living & Co Rice Cooker! Enjoy!
