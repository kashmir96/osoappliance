## Don't Let An 8e Error Sabotage Your Samsung Refrigerator
When an appliance, such as a refrigerator, displays an error code, it can be quite the cause for concern. One of the most common error codes for Samsung fridges is the 8E error code. However, despite the presence of this error, it's important to remember not to let this particular code ruin your Samsung refrigerator.

When a fridge displays the 8E error code, it indicates a communication issue between the control board and the touch panel display. The symptom of this issue is an absent display, or a blank display. To solve this issue, all you need to do is reset the control board in your fridge. To do so, unplug your fridge, unplug the touch panel display, and then wait several minutes before re-plugging in both components.

If resetting the fridge doesn't alleviate the issue, the next step would be to inspect the data cable that connects the control board to the touch panel display. To do this, look for any signs of fraying or wear on the cable, and make sure it's still firmly attached on both ends. If the cable looks damaged, then you'll need to replace it. This is a relatively simple process, but it's best to hire a certified appliance repair technician for assistance.

Fortunately, the 8E error code only relates to one specific issue and it can be remedied with a few simple steps. The key is not to let the error code discourage you from using your Samsung refrigerator. Just follow the steps above and you'll be able to get your fridge running again in no time.

If the 8E error code is not the error code you are encountering with your fridge, be sure to check out our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary. It could be the perfect source to help you unlock the mystery surrounding any error codes you come across with your appliances.
