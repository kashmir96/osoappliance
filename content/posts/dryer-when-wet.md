Can you put your washing in the dryer when wet from washing machine?

The short answer is yes, you can put wet clothes in the dryer. However, there are a few things to consider before doing so.

First, it’s important to understand how the dryer works. The dryer uses heat to evaporate the moisture from the clothes and then exhausts it out of the machine. This means that when you put wet clothes in the dryer, it takes longer for them to dry since the machine has to work harder to evaporate all of the moisture. This also means that your energy bills could be higher if you’re using your dryer more often than necessary.

Second, if your clothes are too wet when you put them in the dryer, they may not come out as soft and fluffy as they normally would. This is because too much moisture can cause some fabrics to become stiff and crunchy after drying. If this happens, you may need to rewash your clothes with fabric softener or use a fabric softener sheet in the dryer to help soften them up again.

Finally, putting wet clothes in the dryer can also lead to mold and mildew growth if there is too much moisture present in the machine for an extended period of time. To prevent this from happening, make sure that you don’t overload your dryer with wet items and clean out any lint or debris that has built up inside of it regularly.

Overall, putting wet clothes in the dryer is possible but should be done with caution. Make sure that you don’t overload your machine and always check for any signs of mold or mildew growth after drying wet items.
