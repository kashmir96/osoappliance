## An Easy Fix to a Broken Oven Knob Shaft

If you’re trying to make dinner but quickly discover that your oven’s knob shaft is broken, don’t panic! There are a few fixes you can attempt at home to get your oven back up and running again. This simple guide will help you repair a broken oven knob shaft easily and quickly.

The first step is to assess the degree of the damage. If it’s a minor issue like a loose knob, then you’re in luck. You should be able to use a screwdriver or pliers to tighten and secure the knob back in place. 

If the damage is more severe, then you’ll need to replace the oven knob. The most common issue with a broken knob shaft is that the actual part is corroded or worn out. You can purchase an identical replacement part to replace the old or damaged one. Make sure to note the model number of your oven so that you can find the exact part you need.

Once you have the replacement knob, it’s time to install it. It’s easy—all you need to do is remove the old knob, remove the nut linking the shaft to the oven, pop the new knob into place, and secure it by replacing the nut.

Finally, reattach the knob shaft’s cable and plug it back into the oven. Now your oven should be up and running—which means dinner can finally get cooked!
