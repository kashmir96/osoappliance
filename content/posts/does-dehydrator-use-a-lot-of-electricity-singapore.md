Dehydrators are a great way to preserve food and extend its shelf life. However, there is a common question that many people ask: do dehydrators use a lot of electricity? The answer is no, they actually don’t use much electricity at all!

In Singapore, the average household uses about 725 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month. A dehydrator uses between 0.33 to 0.75 kWh per hour on average depending on the wattage rating of the machine and the time it runs for. This means that using a dehydrator for one hour will use up less than 1% of your total monthly electricity consumption!

One way to reduce the amount of energy used by your dehydrator is by using it during off-peak hours instead of peak hours when electricity rates are higher. By doing this, you can save even more money without having to compromise on quality or results with your dehydrating projects! 

Additionally, some models come with adjustable thermostats that allow you to set different temperatures for different types of foods being dried so you can conserve energy by not running at full power all the time. 

Finally, most standard household outlets in Singapore have rated current limits ranging from 16A – 32A which means that any appliance connected should not exceed this limit in current draw or else it may cause damage to both your appliance as well as your electrical wiring system within your home or office space! So make sure any Dehydrator you consider purchasing does not exceed these ratings before plugging it in! 

In conclusion, Dehydrators are incredibly efficient appliances that can help you save money in food preservation costs while also helping reduce our collective carbon footprint by using less energy than traditional methods such as air drying or baking in an oven. So if you’re looking for an efficient way to preserve food while keeping costs low and being kinder to our environment, then consider investing in a Dehydrator today!
