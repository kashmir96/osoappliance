Ozone air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular as a way to keep the air in your home fresh and free from pollutants. However, there are some potential health risks associated with using ozone air purifiers that should be taken into consideration before making a purchase.

Ozone is an unstable gas that is created when oxygen molecules in the atmosphere interact with ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It has the ability to react with other chemicals in the environment and can be used to eliminate odors, smoke, and other airborne pollutants. However, too much ozone can cause respiratory problems for humans and animals alike. High levels of ozone can irritate the eyes, throat, nose, and lungs as well as worsen conditions like asthma or allergies. Ozone may also damage materials such as rubber or plastics over time. 

In addition to these potential health risks associated with using ozone air purifiers, there is also evidence suggesting that they may not be very effective at removing particulate matter from the air such as dust mites or pollen particles. This means that while they may help reduce odor levels in your home, they may not be able to reduce allergic reactions caused by these particles.

For these reasons it is important to research any air purifier you are considering purchasing thoroughly before making a decision. If you do decide an ozone air purifier is right for you then make sure you follow all of the manufacturerâ€™s instructions regarding use and maintenance carefully to ensure safe operation of your device.
