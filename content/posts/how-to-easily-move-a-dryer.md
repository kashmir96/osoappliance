Moving a dryer can be a daunting task, especially if it's your first time. But with a few simple steps, you can easily move your dryer without any hassle. 

1. Unplug the Dryer: The first step is to unplug the dryer from the wall outlet. Make sure to turn off the power switch on the wall as well. 

2. Disconnect the Vent: Next, you'll need to disconnect the vent hose from the back of the dryer. This is important to prevent any lint from getting into the new space.

3. Remove the Dryer from the Wall: Once the dryer is unplugged and the vent hose is disconnected, you can start to remove the dryer from the wall. If your dryer is mounted on the wall, you'll need to unscrew the mounting bracket before you can move it.

4. Move the Dryer: Now you can start to move the dryer. Make sure to lift it from the bottom and use a dolly or furniture sliders to help you move it.

5. Reinstall the Dryer: Once you have the dryer in the new space, you'll need to reinstall it. Make sure to secure the dryer to the wall with the mounting bracket and reconnect the vent hose. 

6. Plug in the Dryer: Finally, you can plug the dryer back into the wall outlet and turn on the power switch. 

Moving a dryer doesn't have to be a difficult task. With these simple steps, you can easily move your dryer without any hassle.
