## Must-Know Reviews on Washing Machines
Have you been considering getting a new washing machine? Before you make your purchase it's important to do your research and get to know what others are saying about the latest models and features available. In this blog, we'll share with you some of the latest reviews on washing machines so you can make an informed decision. 

One of the latest washing machines to hit the market is the LG WM3700HWA Smart Wi-Fi Enabled 4.5 Cu. ft. Front Load Washer. This washing machine has been touted for its large capacity that can quickly get through a family's pile of laundry. This washer also has a great steam feature which helps reduce the time needed to get your clothes clean. Consumer Reports recently reviewed and rated this washer highly giving it a score of 81 out of 100. 

Another popular model on the market is the Whirlpool WTW5000DW 5.3 Cu. ft. Top Load Washer. This washer has a larger capacity than the LG model mentioned above, but some consumers feel the additional size sacrifices performance. This washer does have a second rinse cycle, helpful for anyone with allergies or sensitive skin. Consumer Reports also scored this model highly giving it a score of 79 out of 100. 

If you're looking for a more budget-friendly model, the Magic Chef MCSTCW16W4 2.0 Cu. ft. Top Load Washer is an excellent choice. For a smaller price tag, you get some of the same features found on higher-end models like a wide-opening lid, adjustable water level, and multiple wash cycles. The downside to this model is its smaller size which may be an issue for larger households. Consumer Reports gave this model an overall rating of 68 out of 100. 

To sum it up, there are plenty of great washing machines to choose from on the market today.
