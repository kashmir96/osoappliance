## Should You Freeze or Dehydrate Your Food?
Preserving food can seem tricky and intimidating, with so many options and techniques out there. Two of the most popular ways to preserve food are freezing and dehydrating. Whether you’re an experienced cook looking to reserve some Fruits or Vegetables from your garden, or a novice looking to prepare some food in advance, this post is here to help you decide which method to use and why. 

Freezing is a popular and effective method of extending the life of food. Freezing maintains the food’s natural color and texture, and can be done easily with most kitchen appliances. To freeze food, it has to be completely immersed in temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius and stored for a specific amount of time. Freezing is also the best way to preserve food for up to a year, making it a cost effective solution.

Dehydrating is great for preserving both seasonal and harvested fruits and vegetables. Though the food item will lose much of its color, the end product will have a much lighter taste, and can be stored for longer than if it were frozen. Dehydrating requires a dehydrator or similar kitchen appliance, and works by removing the moisture from the food.

Whether you decide to freeze or dehydrate, you'll want to make sure you have the right appliance in your kitchen. For more information and ideas on some of the best kitchen appliances to own, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).

They have very different results, so it's important to consider your dish, budget and end result before making a decision. Whether you opt for freezing or dehydrating, find the right appliance to fit your needs and start preserving your food today!
