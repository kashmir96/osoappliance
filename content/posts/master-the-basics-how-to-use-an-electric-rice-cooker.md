## Cook Perfect Rice Every Time with an Electric Rice Cooker

Making perfect rice can be a daunting task, especially if you’re a beginner cook. If you’re stuck in a rut, using a rice cooker has been known to work wonders. Electric rice cookers are excellent tools to ensure your rice is cooked to perfection every time. Whether you’re a rice aficionado or just beginning, here are the basics you need to know to get the most out of your electric rice cooker.

When using an electric rice cooker, make sure to always use a precise amount of water to the rice ratio. The best way to do this is to fill the measuring cup that comes with it to the desired level for the number of cups of rice you’re preparing, and pour into the rice cooker. Generally, two parts of water to every one part of rice is recommended.

To begin the cooking process, plug in the electric rice cooker and make sure the ‘cook’ button is depressed; it should glow red. Once it has cooked, the cooker will switch to warm mode to keep your cooked rice warm until you’re ready to eat. If you want to turn the warm function off, press the ‘warm’ button and the cooker should switch back to ‘cook’ mode.

Most electric rice cookers also have a timer and delayed start option, so your meal can be freshly cooked when you get home. Simply set the timer and delay options and the rice will be perfectly cooked when you walk in the door.

It is also good to note that electric rice cookers come with a steam tray and dish to cook other items alongside your rice such as fish, meats and vegetables. As these will cook quicker than the rice, steam them first and add them to the rice just before it’s finished cooking.

With a few simple steps, using an electric rice cooker will make the task of preparing perfect rice easy and convenient. Consider investing in a quality rice cooker to make the most of your meals and keep the flavor of your produce and dishes in perfect balance.
