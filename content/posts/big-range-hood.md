A range hood is a device that hangs over the top of your stove or cooktop and collects smoke, grease, steam, and odors from the air. It’s an essential kitchen appliance for any home cook who wants to keep their kitchen clean and free of smoke. Range hoods come in a variety of sizes and styles, but one key factor to consider when choosing one is the size of your range. A bigger range requires a bigger hood to effectively capture all of the cooking fumes, so it’s important to get one that fits properly without obstructing your cooking space.

Range hoods are typically made from stainless steel or other durable materials like aluminum or copper. They come in various shapes, including wall-mounted models that hang from above, island models that fit over an existing island structure in your kitchen, and under-cabinet models that sit beneath cabinets and draw smoke downward into ductwork below. Some models even have built-in lights for additional visibility while cooking—a great feature if you have limited natural light in your kitchen!

To determine what size range hood you need for your particular cooktop or stovetop setup, measure the width between two burners on either side (not counting any built-in griddles). The width should be equal to at least twice the depth of your range (the measurement from front to back). So if you have a 24” wide range with 12” depth then you would want at least a 48” wide range hood. But if you prefer more coverage than this minimum recommendation then go with larger sizes like 54” or 60” which will give you better airflow throughout your kitchen space without sacrificing style! 

It may seem intimidating buying such an expensive appliance but having a good quality ventilating system can save you money down the line by preventing damage caused by excessive grease build up on surfaces as well as reducing energy costs associated with running exhaust fans constantly due to lingering smells in the home after cooking has been done. Plus it adds value to any house should you ever decide to sell! With so many options available today there is sure something out there for everyone—so don’t hesitate when looking for big range hoods; they are worth every penny spent!
