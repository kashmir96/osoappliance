## Solving Troubleshooting Problems in Electrolux Dryers 

The main purpose of a dryer is to dry out your wet clothes and linens. Electrolux dryers are dependable appliances that are reliable, however when problems do arise, it can be frustrating and inconvenient. Below we’ve outlined some common Electrolux dryer issues and how to fix them. 

### Prone to Lint Build Up 
 
It’s important to routinely clean the lint filter of your dryer as lint easily builds up in the filter and can cause blockage. This can reduce the efficiency and quality of a dryer if not taken care of. If you find lint build up, remove the filter and use a vacuum cleaner and a soft-bristle brush to remove all lint from the filter.

### Dryer is Not Heating 

If your dryer is not producing any heat, it’s important to check the heating element to be sure it is working properly. Unplug the dryer and take off the back panel. Check the heating element for any sign of damage. If it appears to be damaged, replace it. If it is intact, you may need to replace the thermostat. 

### Dryer is Taking Too Long 

If the dryer is taking longer than usual to dry your clothing or linens, it could be the result of blocked airflow, reducing the amount of air that can circulate throughout the dryer. To fix this, take out the lint filter and check the venting system to make sure it is clear of any lint or blockage.
