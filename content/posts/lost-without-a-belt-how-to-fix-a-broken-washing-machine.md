## How to Repair a Faulty Washing Machine
When the washing machine has stopped working, it can be lost without a belt. You know you need to take action and check the belt, but beyond that, what are you supposed to do? Well, in this blog post, we’ll explore some tips for fixing a broken washing machine on your own. 

One of the first steps is to locate the belt that drives the drum, or the part that contains the washing. On some machines, this may be hidden beneath plastic panels on the back. It is also recommended that you unplug the machine for safety precautions. To check for any signs of wear and tear, you’ll want to inspect the belt. If you do notice any evidence of damage, you can purchase a replacement belt and install it yourself. 

If the belt is not the problem, the next step might be to inspect the drum bearing. A faulty bearing can cause the drum to judder or make loud noises while spinning. To check the bearing, you’ll need to remove the drum. After doing this, you should be able to check the condition of the bearing and if necessary, replace it. 

If the belt and drum are in good condition, you may need to investigate the motor. If the motor is not spinning, then it may need to be replaced. If the fault lies with the motor, it is best to consult with a professional or purchase a new machine. 

Keep in mind that some broken washing machines can be repaired, while others may require replacement parts or the help of a professional.
