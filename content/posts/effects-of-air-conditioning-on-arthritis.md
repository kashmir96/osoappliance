When it comes to arthritis, air conditioning can be a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, air conditioning helps reduce humidity levels in the home, which can help alleviate joint pain associated with arthritis. On the other hand, sitting in an overly cool environment can cause stiff muscles and joints that could aggravate existing soreness.

For those living with arthritis, it’s important to find a balance between comfort and relief from joint pain. The key is knowing how to adjust the temperature for maximum relief. Here are some tips:

First, keep indoor temperatures cool but not too cold—around 72°F (22°C). This helps reduce swelling of arthritic joints and improves overall comfort levels. 

Second, use your air conditioner’s “auto” feature to maintain this temperature when you’re away from home or sleeping at night (unless you prefer cooler sleeping temperatures). This will save energy while still providing relief from pain and humidity. 

Third, if possible install a humidifier to add moisture back into your home during dry weather conditions as this can help reduce joint discomfort by keeping your skin hydrated. 

Finally, consider investing in an adjustable bed that allows you to easily change positions without having to leave the bed or struggle with stiffness due to cold temperatures in your bedroom. This way you can keep yourself comfortable without sacrificing any of the cooling benefits of air conditioning. 

Overall, air conditioning is beneficial for those suffering from arthritis as it helps regulate temperature and humidity levels inside your home—which could mean less swelling and stiffness throughout the day or night! Just remember that finding balance between temperature settings is key for maximum comfort so experiment until you find what works best for you!
