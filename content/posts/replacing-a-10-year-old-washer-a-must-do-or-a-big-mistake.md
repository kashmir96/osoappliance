## Deciding When to Replace a 10 Year Old Washer

When it comes to deciding whether and when to replace a 10-year-old washing machine, there's quite a bit to consider. It might seem obvious that a 10-year-old washer isn’t functioning optimally, but it could still be running just fine and if you're on a tight budget, it may make more sense to hold off on replacing it. On the other hand, outdated machines tend to be less efficient, meaning they cost more to operate, which could negate the cost savings from a longer lifespan.

In some cases, a 10-year-old washer may not just be inefficient but could pose a risk to your clothes and to you. Clothes can be matted, discolored, or suffer other damage due to an outdated machine that may not agitate the way it should. Inefficient machines can also lead to electric shock or fire. 

When in doubt - when it comes to the safety and quality of your laundry - it’s best to replace your 10-year-old washing machine. But don’t buy blind. Do your research and purchase an ENERGY STAR® certified washer to make sure you’re getting the most efficient and effective model available. Appliance technology is always improving, so look for features like steam and specialized cycles to give your clothes the best possible clean.
