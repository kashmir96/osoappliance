Regular appliance maintenance as part of your business model is a great way to keep customers happy and your enterprise running smoothly. One appliance that is often neglected in the average home is the dryer vent. This component of the dryer exhausts hot air and moist lint-filled air from the drying drum to the outdoor venting system. When not cleaned and maintained regularly, it could lead to serious problems from blocked airflow and lint blockages to water damage, mold, and fire hazards.
