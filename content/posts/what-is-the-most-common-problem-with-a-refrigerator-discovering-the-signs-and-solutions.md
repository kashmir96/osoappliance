## Common Problems with Refrigerators & Solutions

Having a reliable refrigerator is important in any household. Unfortunately, the appliance may experience some issues. Knowing the most common problems with a refrigerator and their solutions is key to ensure its long-term functionality. 

The most common problem with a refrigerator is a lack of coolness. This is often due to incorrect or outdated settings on the exterior temperature control dial or panel. Additionally, a build up of ice in the refrigerator can cause a lack of coolness. To fix this, use the defrost setting. It's also important to ensure that the appliance is getting enough power, and not too much. It's best to consult an electrician in this case, as too much power can be dangerous. 

Another issue that can arise with refrigerators is the motor not working properly. Problems with the motor can make the refrigerator start and stop frequently. Sometimes, this can be addressed easily by giving the motor a rest. If that doesn't work, it's best to call a qualified technician to check the motor. 

Finally, some refrigerators may suffer from condensation. This is usually caused by a lack of insulation or if the door isn't sealed correctly. To fix this problem, use putty around the doorâ€™s gasket. Putty helps to create an airtight seal and reduce the amount of condensation. 

Knowing the most common problems with a refrigerator and their solutions is the best way to ensure its long-term functionality. If properly maintained, a refrigerator can last for years to come. However, it's still important to become familiar with the appliance and its working parts.
