If you own a restaurant, cafe, hotel or any other business that requires a dishwasher for cleaning, then you know that having the right dishwashing detergent is essential. Not only does it help make your dishes sparkle and shine, but it also helps prevent bacteria and food-borne illnesses.

There are several different types of dishwashing detergents available on the market today. The most popular choice is powdered detergents because they are the least expensive and offer good cleaning power. Liquid detergents tend to be more expensive but can often provide better results than powdered detergents. There are also enzyme-based detergents available which can effectively remove tough stains such as red wine or coffee stains.

No matter which type of dishwashing detergent you choose, there are some essential features you should look for when making your purchase: 

• Phosphates: Phosphates help to soften hard water so that it will be easier for the soap to lather up and provide better cleaning power. However, in recent years phosphates have been banned in many countries due to their potential environmental impact so be sure to check if this applies in your area before purchasing a product with phosphates. 

• Chlorine Bleaching Agents: Chlorine bleaching agents can help whiten whites while getting rid of tough grease and oils on dishes without leaving behind residue or streaks. Just remember that chlorine bleaches can cause damage over time so use caution when using them on delicate items such as crystal glassware or fine china. 

• Surfactants: Surfactants are substances that reduce surface tension between two liquids which helps create suds when mixed with water. This helps break down dirt particles while lifting them off dishes so they can be washed away more easily during rinsing cycles. 

 • Fragrance: Fragrance is often added to commercial grade dishwashing liquid to make it smell nice while eliminating unpleasant odors from food residues left behind during washing cycles. However, some people may have allergies or sensitivities to certain fragrances so keep this in mind when choosing a product for your business’s needs. 

 • pH Balancers: pH balancers help restore balance between alkaline and acidic elements in water which prevents damage from occurring on surfaces during washing cycles such as discoloration or fading of colors due to corrosion caused by acidic elements present in water supplies from different areas around the world .

When choosing a commercial grade dishwashing liquid for your business’s needs make sure you take into consideration all these factors before making a purchase!
