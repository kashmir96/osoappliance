Do you own a washing machine that you haven’t used for two years or more? If so, it’s time to start thinking about what to do with it. While leaving a washing machine unused for an extended period of time can lead to rust and other damage, there are several ways that you can use it again.

One way to make use of a long-unused washing machine is by using it as an extra storage space. You can store items such as clothing, linens, and towels in the unit, allowing them to be kept away from any heat or humidity. Additionally, if your old washer has any rust on the exterior or inside drum, simply line the interior of the drum with plastic sheeting before placing items inside. This will help protect those items from getting damaged in case any rust flakes off. 

Another way to repurpose an older washer is by using it for outdoor projects such as gardening or landscaping. For example, you can put soil into the drum and mix together compost and fertilizer before spreading onto your garden beds. Or if you have large rocks or stones that need sorting through for landscaping projects, putting them in the washer's drum is a great way to easily sort out smaller stones from bigger ones. 

Finally, if all else fails – donate your old washing machine! There are many charities who accept donations of appliances like washing machines so they can be given out to families in need who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford one themselves. Not only will this benefit others who may lack access but it also helps reduce landfill waste because donated appliances are refurbished instead of being thrown away when no longer working properly. 

No matter how long your washing machine has been unused for two years or more – there are still ways that you can get some value out of this investment! Whether its storing items safely indoors , doing outdoor projects more efficiently ,or helping someone in need – repurposing an old washer is always a great idea!
