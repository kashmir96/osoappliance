When it comes to cooking, an oven is a must-have appliance. Ovens are used to bake, roast, broil, and even dehydrate food. But what exactly happens when you turn on an oven?

When an oven is turned on, the heating element inside the oven starts to heat up. This heat is transferred to the air inside the oven and then circulated throughout the cooking chamber. As the air temperature rises, so does the temperature of your food. The higher the temperature of your oven, the faster your food will cook.

The other important factor in cooking with an oven is convection. Convection occurs when hot air is circulated around your food using fans or blowers located inside the oven. This helps to evenly distribute heat throughout your food, resulting in more even cooking and browning.

Finally, when you open an oven door during baking or roasting, you are letting out some of the hot air and decreasing the temperature inside the oven. This can cause a decrease in cooking time and result in undercooked or unevenly cooked food. To prevent this from happening, make sure to close your oven door as soon as you open it to let out steam or check on your food's progress.

Whether you're baking a cake or roasting a turkey, using an oven correctly can help ensure that your meals come out perfectly cooked every time!
