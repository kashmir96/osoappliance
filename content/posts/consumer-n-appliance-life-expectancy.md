Consumer appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and dryers, are essential pieces of equipment for many households. They provide convenience and comfort – but only if they’re working properly. Knowing how long your appliances are expected to last can help you plan for the future and ensure that you’re getting the most out of your investment.

When it comes to appliance life expectancy, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Different types of appliances have different lifespans, and individual units can vary depending on a number of factors including usage patterns and maintenance habits. Generally speaking though, most consumer appliances will last between 10 and 15 years before needing to be replaced. The following is an overview of what you can expect from some common household appliances:

Refrigerator - Refrigerators typically last about 13 years on average; however, well-maintained units may last up to 20 years or more with proper care.

Washer/Dryer - Washers and dryers tend to have a longer lifespan than other consumer appliances because they don't experience as much wear-and-tear over time. A good quality washer/dryer set should last around 12–15 years before needing replacement parts or a full replacement unit. 

Dishwasher - Dishwashers usually have an average lifespan of around 9–10 years; however, this varies depending on usage patterns and maintenance habits as well as the quality of the dishwasher itself. 

Range/Stove - Ranges or stoves also tend to have an average lifespan of about 9–10 years; however, newer models may be able to withstand more wear-and-tear over time which means they could last up to 15 years or longer with proper care. 

Microwave - Microwaves typically last anywhere from 5–10 years depending on usage frequency; however some newer models can now withstand more wear-and-tear over time which means that they could potentially last even longer with proper care .

Overall it’s important to remember that these life expectancy estimates are just averages – individual models may vary greatly in terms of longevity based on their quality construction as well as how often they are used and how well maintained they are kept over time . Taking good care of your home appliances will go a long way towards ensuring that you get maximum use out of them before needing replacements!
