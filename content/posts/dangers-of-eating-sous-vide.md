When it comes to cooking, sous vide is one of the hottest trends. However, while this popular cooking method may offer some delicious meals, there's no denying that it can also be dangerous if you're not careful.

Sous vide involves submerging food in a water bath and then heating it to a precise temperature for an extended period of time. This slow-cooking method helps preserve the texture and flavor of foods like beef and vegetables. While this process may sound appealing, there are some potential dangers associated with sous vide that you should be aware of before attempting this cooking method at home.

First, food cooked at lower temperatures can increase the risk of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella or E. coli due to the fact that these bacteria can survive at temperatures below what typically kills them off when cooked in a traditional kitchen setting. In addition, if raw food isn't cooked thoroughly enough or is left in the water bath for too long, bacteria can multiply quickly making them more likely to cause illness when consumed. To help avoid this risk, make sure your sous vide machine has an accurate temperature sensor and always check your foodâ€™s internal temperature with a probe thermometer before consuming it to ensure that it has been cooked through properly. 

Secondly, because sous vide requires plastic bags or other containers to hold the food during cooking, there is also potential for harmful chemicals like BPA (Bisphenol A) from the plastic containers leeching into the foods being cooked which could be hazardous if ingested over time in large amounts. To reduce this risk make sure you only use FDA approved plastic bags specifically designed for sous vide purposes as well as check their expiration date prior to use so they don't become brittle and prone to leaking chemicals into your food while being heated up during cooking. 

Finally, another potential danger with using sous vide is that because many people assume their foods have been fully cooked after going through this process they don't take additional steps such as searing or grilling their meats which helps kill off any remaining bacteria on its surface after heating up inside its container during sous vide cooking leading them vulnerable to getting sick from consuming these items raw or undercooked despite being submerged in hot water temperatures for extended periods of time prior to serving them up onto their plate . 

Overall while there are some potential dangers associated with using sous vide when done correctly it can be an effective way of preparing delicious meals provided proper safety precautions are taken into consideration each step along the way both prior to and after its completion .
