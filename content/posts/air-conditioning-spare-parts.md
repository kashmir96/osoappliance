Air conditioning is an essential part of modern life, and when it breaks down, you’re likely to feel the effects quickly. Having a good understanding of air conditioning spare parts can help you better understand the inner workings of your system, so that when it does break down, you can make an educated decision about what to do next. 

The components that make up a central air conditioning system are divided into two main categories: the indoor unit and the outdoor unit. The indoor unit includes the evaporator coil and fan, while the outdoor unit includes the compressor and condenser coil. Each of these units contains several key components that are essential for proper operation. 

The first component of an air conditioner is its evaporator coil which absorbs heat from inside your home and transfers it to refrigerant flowing through its metal pipes. Without a functioning evaporator coil, your air conditioner won’t be able to cool your home effectively. Next is the fan blade which helps move cooled air through your home by spinning at high speeds when activated by your thermostat. Also within this category are thermistors which measure temperature as well as expansion valves and blower motors which help regulate temperatures in different areas of your home. 

Your outdoor unit contains a compressor which works with refrigerant to cool and circulate air throughout your house; without it, no cooling would occur at all! In addition to this are contactors (relays) that turn on/off power supply to other parts such as blower motors or compressors when necessary; capacitors which store energy needed for certain electrical components such as fans; filter driers which absorb moisture from inside refrigerant lines; pressure switches that monitor refrigerant pressure levels; reversing valves used in heat pumps; suction line accumulators used in some systems during extreme weather conditions; and more! All these components work together seamlessly in order for efficient cooling throughout summer months (or heating during winter). 

It’s important to familiarize yourself with each part of an AC system so that if any issues arise – like lack of cooling or noisy components – you can take action more quickly before things get worse or even potentially dangerous! Make sure you know who to contact should anything go wrong – whether it’s a friend or local HVAC professional – so they can help diagnose any problems with spare parts replacement if needed.
