If you’re in the market for a new hair dryer, you may want to consider investing in a Dyson hair dryer. This high-tech drying tool is designed to give you the perfect blowout without damaging your hair. But how much does a Dyson hair dryer cost?

The price of a Dyson hair dryer depends on the specific model and features. The top-of-the-line Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer Pro retails for $499 USD, while the more basic models start at around $399 USD. For example, the popular Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer comes with three magnetic attachments and retails for $399 USD. 

No matter which model you choose, all Dyson hair dryers have several features that set them apart from other models on the market: 
* Intelligent heat control – The intelligent heat control feature keeps each section of your hair evenly heated to prevent over styling or split ends 
* Air Multiplier technology – This fanless design delivers powerful airflow without dragging down or overheating your hair 
* Lightweight yet powerful motor – At just 1.8 pounds (0.8kgs), this lightweight yet powerful motor ensures fast drying times without causing fatigue 
 * Magnetic attachments – The magnetized attachments ensure easy setup and quick changes between styling settings 

 All these features make the price tag easier to swallow, but if it’s still too steep there are always alternative options available that are still good quality but are more affordable than a full-fledged Dyson hairdryer such as Revlon Pro Collection 1875W Tourmaline Ion Dryers or BaBylissPRO Ceramix Xtreme 2000 Watt Dryers .

 In conclusion, if you're looking for an efficient way to get perfect salon-like results at home then investing in a high quality and feature packed Dyson hairdryer is worth every penny!
