## Unlocking How To Put Electrolux Washer Into Diagnostic Mode

We’ve all experienced the disappointment of costly and complex home appliance malfunctions; appliances that are supposed to make our lives easier suddenly become a source of frustration. Thankfully, Electrolux manufactures quality state-of-the-art washing machines that are user-friendly and reliable. However, when things go wrong the process of diagnosing the issue and locating the repair parts can be daunting. The good news is these models are designed with built-in diagnostics designed to streamline the process of diagnosing and repairing. This article will explain how to enter diagnostic mode with your Electrolux Washer.

When you first enter diagnostic mode, your washer is put into a default factory setting. All of your settings will be reset and the washer will be ready to collect comprehensive data that will help you identify the source of the error found during the diagnostics test. The machine will also be instructed to log a number of failures that occur while in this state.

To put your Electrolux washer in diagnostic mode, begin by pressing the power button. When the washer is on, select the spin option using the arrow keys. You can then enter diagnostic mode by pressing the ‘delay start’ and ‘end of cycle’ switches simultaneously. Your washer will now enter a self-test mode which can help identify potential problems.

In order to exit diagnostic mode, your washer will need to be reset. You can either unplug the washer for about 30 seconds or enter the diagnostic reset mode. To enter the reset mode, press the delay start and end of cycle switches again. Your washer should attempt to reset itself.

Once you have activated and completed the diagnostic mode on your Electrolux washer, you can now quickly troubleshoot and diagnose any potential issues. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of your washer before paying for costly repairs. Remember to check our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) which contains detailed descriptions of the various error codes that your washer may encounter in diagnostic mode.
