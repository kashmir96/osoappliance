If your stove won't light, chances are that there is an issue with the gas supply, the ignition, or the pilot light. In order to determine the source of the problem, it's important to check each of these components.

First, make sure that the gas is turned on at the source. Whether it is natural gas or propane, make sure that the gas valve is in the "on" position. If the gas is on and the stove still won't light, the next step is to check the ignition. If you have an electronic ignition, make sure that it is in working order and that the power is on. You can also try pressing the ignition switch several times to see if it will spark and light the stove.

If the ignition is working properly and the stove still won't light, then the issue may be with the pilot light. A pilot light is a small flame that is used to ignite the gas when the stove is turned on. If the pilot light has gone out, it can be difficult to relight. The best way to do this is to follow the instructions in your owner's manual. Generally, this involves pressing a button or knob to turn off the gas, then waiting a few minutes before turning it back on and lighting the pilot light with a match or lighter.

Once you have checked the ignition, the gas supply, and the pilot light, you should be able to determine why your stove won't light. If none of these issues resolves the problem, it's best to call a professional to inspect the stove and determine the source of the issue.
