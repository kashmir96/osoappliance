Stove piping is a term used to describe the process of collecting and managing data in an inefficient and disorganized manner. The term is derived from the analogy of a stove pipe, which carries smoke up from a burning fire. In the context of data management, stove piping refers to disparate systems that are not integrated or connected with one another, resulting in isolated data silos and limited access to information.

The concept of stove piping originated in military intelligence circles during World War II. During that time, intelligence was gathered from separate sources but then sent up the chain of command in an isolated fashion. This created silos of information that could not be easily accessed by those who needed it most — those on the front lines making tactical decisions. 

Today, stove piping remains an issue for organizations trying to manage large amounts of data across multiple departments or systems. Without proper integration between systems, each department may have its own set of processes and procedures for collecting and storing data — resulting in unconnected silos that make it difficult to share information across departments or organizations.

Stove piping can also lead to inefficient use of resources as different departments may be duplicating efforts without knowing it due to lack of communication between systems. It can also result in inaccurate reporting due to inadequate access to all relevant information needed for decision-making purposes. 

Organizations need to ensure they have comprehensive strategies for managing their data so they can avoid falling into a pattern of stove piping and instead foster an environment where information can be shared quickly and easily across departments or organizations when needed. This requires strong processes for integrating disparate systems into a unified whole so all stakeholders have access to accurate and timely information when needed.
