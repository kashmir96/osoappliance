Making milkshake with a milkshake maker is so easy, it’s almost foolproof! You can make a delicious and creamy shake in just a few minutes. Here’s how to do it:

1. Start by gathering your ingredients. You’ll need ice cream, milk, any mix-ins you’d like (like chocolate chips or fruit), and any toppings you might want to add at the end (like whipped cream).

2. Place the ice cream into the milkshake maker. Add enough milk to create a thick and creamy texture; about 1/4 cup for every scoop of ice cream works well. If you want to add mix-ins, put them in now too.

3. Put the lid on the milkshake maker and turn it on. Let it run for 2-3 minutes until all of the ingredients are blended together. If your milkshake is still too thick, add a bit more milk until you get your desired consistency.

4. Remove the lid from the milkshake maker and pour your shake into glasses or mugs of your choice — don’t forget to top with whipped cream or any other toppings! Enjoy!
