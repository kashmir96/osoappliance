## How Much is a Laundromat Washing Machine? 

If you're looking to get your own laundry done without the hassle of going to a laundromat, getting your own washing machine can make all the difference. But how much is a laundromat washing machine? It depends on the type of machine and model you choose. 

If you're looking for an entry level top loading washer, typically this type of washer will cost between $400 and $700 depending on features like size, spin speeds and energy efficiency ratings. Front loading machines are generally more expensive with prices ranging from $500 -$1000 depending on features. 

For commercial grade washers used in laundromats or other public facilities, pricing can vary greatly due to differences in capacity, cycle times and overall construction quality. Prices for these machines range from $1,000 to over $10,000 per unit depending upon those factors as well as brand reputation and warrantees that may come included with the purchase. 

Of course if purchasing isn't an option for you there's always rental options! Many rental companies offer appliances available for rent such as washers and dryers that may be more cost effective than buying them outright while still providing access to reliable laundry solutions. You can research appliance rental companies [here](./pages/appliance-rental) so you can get your laundry needs met without breaking the bank!
