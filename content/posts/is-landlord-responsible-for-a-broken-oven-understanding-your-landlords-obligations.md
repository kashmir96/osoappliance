## Landlord's Responsibilities and Obligations Around a Broken Oven

As a tenant, knowing the extent of your landlord's obligations and legal responsibilities when it comes to the repair and upkeep of your rental property, including when an oven is broken, is key to resolving any issues as quickly as possible.

In most cases, a landlord is required to maintain the rental property in a condition to be habitable, meaning all appliances and fixtures including ovens must remain in working order. In the event of a broken oven, the landlord will then be responsible for organising its repair or replacement. They may carry out the work themselves or contact a qualified tradesperson to do the job.

However, some tenancy agreements leave the cost of repairs up to the tenant. This is more common when the landlord has included a clause in the agreement stating that wear and tear will not be covered. If you think the broken oven was caused by fair wear and tear, then you can contact the landlord or property manager to open up a dialogue with them and get the device repaired.

It is also worth noting that not all repairs are covered. Landlordâ€™s are obligated to restore the oven to its original condition, but may not have to pay for upgrades.

It is important to check you have read the tenancy agreement thoroughly and that any specific obligations around appliance repairs are clearly understood.

In conclusion, it is ultimately up to the landlord to determine who is responsible for the cost of repairing or replacing a broken oven. Whether it's down to fair wear and tear of the appliance or an accidental breakage, responsible tenants are able to engage with their landlord and work out a plan for repair or replacement.
