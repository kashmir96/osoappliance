## Locate the Reset Button on Circuit Boards

Household appliances often have circuit boards with a reset button that can be used to reset the device if it has malfunctioned. We understand the importance of circuit boards and reset buttons for operating your device. This blog will provide a simple guide for finding the reset button on a circuit board. 

Opening up your appliance allows access to the device's circuit board. The reset button will appear as a small black or red button and is indicated by an RST label. It is important to locate this reset button before you begin working as it can help prevent any unnecessary damage. 

Once you locate the reset button, you will need to press and hold the button down for around 10 seconds, then release it. On some circuit boards, you may need to press it more than once. This will reset the circuit board and the device and should solve any issues. 

It is important to follow all safety requirements before attempting to work on any device. It is also important not to rush through the process, as a mistake may cause further damages. If you are still having trouble finding the reset button on the board or have specific appliance issues, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) can be a helpful resource.
