If you’ve noticed your stove is smoking, it’s important to take the necessary steps to address the issue. Smoking stoves can be dangerous and can lead to fire hazards if not taken care of properly. Here are a few tips on how to handle a smoking stove:

1. Check the Burners: If you notice smoke coming from your stove, check the burners first. Make sure they are turned off and that there is no residue or debris left on them. If there is, clean it off with a damp cloth or paper towel.

2. Check the Oven: If smoke is coming from your oven, make sure it is turned off and that there is nothing in it that could be causing the smoke. This could include food, grease, or other items that have been left in the oven for too long and are now burning or smoldering. 

3. Clean the Stovetop: If your stovetop is dirty, it could be causing smoke due to built-up grease and other debris. Clean the surface of your stovetop with a degreaser or all-purpose cleaner and then dry it off with a clean cloth or paper towel. 

4. Check for Gas Leaks: If you have a gas stove, check for any gas leaks around the burners or pipes leading into them. If you smell gas, turn off all of the burners and contact a professional immediately to fix any leaks before attempting to use your stove again. 

5. Check Your Exhaust Fans: Make sure that your exhaust fans are functioning properly as they can help reduce smoke from cooking on your stovetop. Clean them regularly so that they are working efficiently and don’t allow smoke to accumulate in your kitchen space. 

If none of these steps help reduce the amount of smoke coming from your stove, contact an appliance repair technician who can diagnose and repair any underlying issues with your appliance safely and effectively. Taking care of a smoking stove quickly will help ensure its safe operation in the future!
