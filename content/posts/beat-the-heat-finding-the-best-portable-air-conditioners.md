## Stay Cool This Summer With A Portable Air Conditioner

These summer months can be tough to endure without the luxury of a central air conditioning system. But while a permanent AC system might be out of reach, there are still plenty of options to find relief from the heat. Portable air conditioners offer a great remedy without the need for extensive set up and renovation.

While portable air conditioners are typically more expensive than window-installed models, they provide the benefit of being able to cool multiple rooms, and even outdoor areas. They also come with an array of features that can be customized for your needs, like adjustable temperature settings, timers and dehumidifiers.

One of the biggest factors to consider when purchasing a portable air conditioner is its cooling capacity. Make sure you get a unit that is the right size for your room and one that can handle the temperature of your climate. If youâ€™re looking for a more energy efficient model, look for one with a high energy efficiency rating. Additionally, keep an eye out for special features like built-in air quality filters, and noise level ratings, as some portable ACs can be particularly noisy.
