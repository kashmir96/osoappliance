## Troubleshooting the Common 2e Error Code on Samsung Washing Machines 
The 2e error code can be daunting when you see it appear on the display of your Samsung Washing machine. But, there are solutions that you can try, and if nothing works you can always refer to a comprehensive appliance error codes glossary for more help.

The error code appears as "2E" or "2e" on the washing machine display. The code is an indication of communication problems between the main PCB (printed circuit board) and the motor drive. Although this error code is specific to Samsung washing machines, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the motor’s fault; it could also be due to a faulty main PCB.

The first step in troubleshooting is to unplug the appliance and leave it plugged off for a few minutes to see if the error message is gone when turning it back on. If the same error code returns, the problem can be an overload or a problem with the wiring. If the latter is the case, then a technician may need to be called in and the wiring may need to be examined.

It’s also possible that the Appliance Control Module (ACM) needs to be replaced. The ACM is the computer handling system on the washing machine and it’s responsible for controlling the washing cycles. If the ACM is faulty, then it needs to be replaced or reprogrammed.

It’s a good idea to check the household circuit breaker to make sure it’s intact and working. This can also help fix the 2e error code. Check and make sure all circuits are run properly, and the wiring of the appliance is properly connected.

If the problem lies within the motor, then a technician needs to be called in to examine the problem. The technician may need to replace the motor or simply check the wiring configuration as to why it’s not communicating properly with the main PCB.

Ultimately, if all else fails, you can always refer to a comprehensive appliance error codes glossary for more help, such as our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). It’s the best source to clearly identify and troubleshoot all kinds of appliance errors.

Troubleshooting the 2e error code on Samsung washing machines doesn’t need to be a difficult task. There are easy and cost-efficient fixes for this issue, and you can try them all. If nothing works in the end, our comprehensive appliance error codes glossary is there to help you out.
