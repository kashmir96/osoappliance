Are you ready for a hot cup of tea but unsure when your kettle is done? It can be difficult to know when the water in your kettle has finished boiling, especially if you’re not sure what to look for. Here are some tips that can help you determine when your kettle is done boiling and your tea is ready to drink. 

First, listen for the sound of the whistle. This will be one of the most prominent signs that your water has boiled and it’s time for tea. Many kettles have a built-in whistle or bell that will make a loud sound once the water reaches boiling point. If yours doesn’t have one, there’s still a good chance you will hear a bubbling or whistling sound coming from inside the kettle as it boils. 

Second, watch for steam coming from the spout of your kettle. When steam begins pouring out from around the lid or spout area, this indicates that all of the water inside has boiled away and it’s time to turn off your stovetop or electric element to avoid burning out your appliance. 

Third, wait for the click of the button turning off that indicates it's finished heating up. Some kettles have a built-in button that will click off when the water inside has reached boiling point. This is typically accompanied by a light turning off or on as well.

Fourth, get a smart kettle that will tell you when it's done. Today there are even smart kettles that have built-in temperature sensors and a display that will tell you exactly when the water is ready to be poured into your cup.

Lastly, check with an external thermometer if necessary. If neither of these methods works for you, feel free to use an external thermometer like a candy thermometer or digital kitchen thermometer to measure how hot the water inside is before pouring yourself a cup of tea! 

Knowing when your kettle is done boiling isn’t always easy but following these simple steps can help ensure that each cup is as perfect as possible!
