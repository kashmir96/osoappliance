Welcome to the blog of Dishwasher Parts Christchurch! We are a local shop that specializes in providing quality replacement parts for dishwashers. In this blog, we will be discussing some of the different components that make up a dishwasher, so you can better understand how your appliance works.

In order to get a better idea of what is inside your dishwasher, let’s start with the exterior components. The outer shell of the dishwasher is made from stainless steel or plastic and is designed to protect the internal parts from dirt and dust. The door has an outer glass panel which allows you to see inside the machine when it’s running. You will also find several control knobs on the outside of your machine, these are used to select cycles, temperature settings and other features.

Now let’s move onto some of the internal components that play a role in making your dishwasher work properly. At the bottom you will find an electric motor which powers all of its functions such as washing and rinsing dishes, draining water and spinning them dry. Next there is a pump which helps circulate water through all of its compartments while also draining away any excess water once it has completed its cycle. Lastly there is an electronic control board which controls all other aspects such as setting cycle times and temperatures as well as controlling safety features like overheating protection etc…

These are just some basic pieces that make up a typical dishwasher but depending on your model there may be additional parts such as heating elements or water filters etc…At Dishwasher Parts Christchurch we stock most common replacement parts for most major brands so if ever need something for your machine then please don't hesitate to contact us!
