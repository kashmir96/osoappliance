## Troubleshooting Indesit Washing Machine Repairs

1. **What should I check first if my Indesit washing machine isn't working properly?** 
Check the power supply cord or plug connection. Also, check the fuse and circuit breaker to make sure they are in working order.

2. **What should I do if the power cord is intact but the washing machine still isn't working?** 
Try resetting the washing machine by unplugging it, waiting 30 seconds, then plugging it back in.

3. **What if the machine still won't turn on after a reset?** 
Check the filter and the inlet hose for blockages, as a blockage could be preventing the machine from turning on.

4. **What should I do if there is water in the machine and it won't spin?** 
Check the belt wheel and drive belt for any signs of damage or wear and tear. If the belt wheel is loose, you may need to tighten it.

5. **What should I do if the washing cycle won't start?** 
Check the door interlock and make sure it is functioning properly. If the door is not closing all the way, it may not be activating the interlock.
