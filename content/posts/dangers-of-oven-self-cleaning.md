If you’ve ever used a self-cleaning oven, you know how convenient it can be. But did you know that this feature carries some risks with it? In order to help keep your home and family safe, let’s take a look at the dangers of oven self-cleaning.

When an oven is in the self-cleaning mode, temperatures can reach up to 900°F or more. This heat is necessary to break down food particles and grease into ash. However, these high temperatures can also cause potential harm to humans or pets if they are near the appliance during this time. Therefore, it’s important to make sure that everyone in your household knows not to be near the oven while it is self-cleaning.

Another danger of an oven self-cleaning is its production of smoke and fumes that can be harmful if inhaled for too long. Therefore, it’s recommended that you open windows and turn on fans when using this feature in order to increase ventilation in the area where your oven is located. Additionally, some models may require you to use special cleaning solutions or sprays during their cycle; make sure any fumes from these products have been allowed time enough time dissipate before entering the room again. 

Finally, when using an oven self-cleaning feature for a long period of time (3 hours or more), there’s a chance that the internal wiring could overheat and become damaged due to extended exposure at high temperatures — which could lead to fire hazards in extreme cases. So make sure not run your appliance any longer than necessary! 

As we discussed above, there are certain risks involved with using an oven’s self-clean function — but these hazards don’t mean that you should avoid taking advantage of this convenient feature altogether! Just be sure to follow all safety instructions provided by your manufacturer and stay away from the appliance during its cycle for maximum protection against any potential danger..
