Microwaves are a staple appliance in most kitchens, and they come in a variety of sizes to suit your needs. But when it comes to the biggest size microwave available, what should you look for?

The largest microwave ovens measure between 30 and 36 inches wide. These large microwaves are perfect for large households or those who cook frequently. With larger capacity microwaves, you’ll be able to fit bigger dishes and larger batches of food inside. Plus, these models have more power than their smaller counterparts, so cooking times will be faster. You’ll also find extra features like convection cooking and sensor cook settings in some of the bigger models. 

When shopping for a big microwave oven, pay attention to the cubic feet capacity as this will tell you how much space is available inside for cooking food items or reheating leftovers. A 2-3 cubic foot capacity is usually sufficient but if you’re looking for even bigger microwaves then 4-5 cubic feet is ideal. Some of the best features on large microwaves include convection baking and roasting capabilities as well as sensor cook settings that take all the guesswork out of heating up your meals accurately every time! 

If you’re looking for an extra-large microwave oven then consider investing in an over-the-range model that combines both ventilation and microwaving into one convenient package. These units can range in size from 30 inches wide all the way up to 36 inches wide depending on your needs and preferences! Most over-the-range models also have powerful vent fans built into them which helps keep smoke and odours from lingering while cooking with your microwave oven. 

No matter what size kitchen you have there is a perfect sized microwave out there waiting to take its place! From small countertop models right through to jumbo over-the range versions – there truly is something out there with enough space and power suitable for any kitchen set up!
