## Troubleshooting General Electric Washers Featuring Error Code 5d 
Given the rise in the ownership of the household appliances over family homes and the complexities that come with error codes, homeowners are sometimes left feeling frustrated when trying to diagnose a fault unaided. 

The error code '5d' is a common occurrence on GE washers, featuring a myriad of causes and solutions. This guide takes you through the core issues that lead to the '5d' code and shows you how to easily address them with a few common household items. 

The Error Code 5d indicates a possible error with the door lock circuit. This generally occurs when the washer receives an error with the key switch or the washer control while attempting to lock the door. It's solution is relatively simple and often involves verifying that the unit is correctly plugged into the wall, resetting the circuit, ensuring the washer door is properly closed, or starting and restarting the washer; giving it a few minutes in between for the control to reset itself. 

If the above does not solve the issue, another common problem occurs when the washer's user interface board or the door latch itself is faulty, meaning it is stuck and needs to be manually opened. If this is the case, unplugging the washer from the wall and pressing and holding the start button for around 10 seconds should release the door lock and enable you to open the unit.

After addressing the error, you should reset the washer and perform a cycle test to ensure it is working properly. 

In conclusion, Error Code 5d can be seen with General Electric Washers due to potential errors with the door lock circuit. Using our troubleshooting guide today, you should have been able to address the error code without any major engineering repairs.
