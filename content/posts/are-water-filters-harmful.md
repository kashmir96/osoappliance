Are water filters harmful? The short answer is: it depends. 

Different types of water filters can have different impacts on the water. Generally, most filter systems are designed to remove impurities and contaminants from your drinking water, making them a safer choice than untreated tap water. However, if a filter is not maintained properly or an incorrect type is used, it can actually make your drinking water less safe than before. 

The main concern for many people is that their home filtration system may contain lead or other toxins that could leach into the treated drinking water from the filter medium. To be safe, it is important to check with your local health department or certifying agency to ensure your filter system has been certified by an accredited laboratory. If possible, also look for a system that has been tested and certified by NSF International (formerly known as National Sanitation Foundation). 

In addition to potential contamination of the treated drinking water, another concern with some types of home filtration systems are their environmental impact. Some filters use activated carbon which can introduce chemicals into wastewater streams if not disposed of properly. In addition, plastic filters should be recycled since they cannot be composted and will eventually end up in landfills where they may take hundreds of years to decompose. 

In summary, most home filtration systems are designed to improve the quality of your drinking water and make it safer for consumption – but only if used correctly and according to manufacturer instructions. To ensure that you are getting the best protection possible for your family’s health and well-being, always check with certifying agencies before purchasing any type of filter system for at-home use.
