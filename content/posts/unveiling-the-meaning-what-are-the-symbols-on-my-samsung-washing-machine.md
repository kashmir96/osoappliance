## Deciphering the Symbols on Your Samsung Washing Machine
An array of symbols can be found on any washing machine, but they can sometimes appear confusing and intimidating without the right know-how. This article will focus on the symbols found on Samsung washing machines, helping you to decipher their meaning.

On the right side of your Samsung washing machine, you’ll find a set of symbols typically in the form of dials, buttons, information labels and even stitching on the fabric. Variations of foldable doors and/or time display will also be present.

At the top of the Samsung washing machine is typically a water-level indicator. This knob can be used to control the amount of water being used – the level chosen will depend on the size of the load. The dial will often display labels such as 'Extra Rinse' or 'Small Load'.

Below the water-level indicator is usually a “start” knob. This is what you turn to activate your washing cycle. But to understand what you’re setting the washing machine to do, you will need to familiarise yourself with the various symbols.

The most common symbols are a washing machine drum with wavy lines evaporating from it, which indicates different spin speeds. When thelines turn into dots, this usually indicates a pre-wash cycle. You may also find symbols of a double bucket - this indicates the option to select a specific temperature. And if you find the setting labeled with a word such as “Cotton”, this indicates a particular type of fabric cycle.

Symbols often appear as figures, circles, and even letters (ie. 'H' will indicate hot water, while 'E' stands for extra rinse). It is important to take the time to research the symbols so that you can use your washing machine with ease.

By understanding the symbols and labels on your Samsung washing machine, you can rest assured that you will receive an efficient and reliable service.
