Blue air purifiers are the perfect way to keep your home’s air clean and free of allergens, dust, and other contaminants. But to optimize the performance of your blue air purifier, there are several accessories you should consider investing in.

The first accessory you should consider is an extra filter for your blue air purifier. Blue filters need to be periodically replaced as they become clogged with dirt and dust particles. Having a spare filter on hand ensures that you don’t have to wait for a new one when it’s time for a replacement. It also allows you to quickly switch out filters if needed in order to maintain optimal performance from your blue air purifier.

Another accessory that can help ensure the best results from your blue air purifier is an ionizing negative oxygen generator (ION). This device releases negatively charged ions into the room which attach themselves to airborne particles such as dust and pollen, making them easier for your filter to trap and remove from the air. Not only does this help improve the efficiency of your blue air purifier, but it also helps reduce unpleasant odors in the room by neutralizing them on contact. 

Finally, a UV light sanitizer is one of the most important accessories you can use with a blue air purifier. This device uses ultraviolet light waves that kill germs, bacteria and viruses passing through them before they have a chance to reach people in the room where it is installed. This provides an additional layer of protection against airborne illnesses like colds or flu while helping keep everyone in your home safe from airborne contaminants like mold spores or pet dander. 

In conclusion, there are several different accessories available for use with blue air purifiers that can help improve their performance and make sure everyone in your home stays healthy and breathing clean indoor air free of pollutants or allergens all year round!
