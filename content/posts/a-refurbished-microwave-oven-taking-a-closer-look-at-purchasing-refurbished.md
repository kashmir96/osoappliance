## Refurbished Microwave Ovens Advantages and Disadvantages

When considering purchasing new appliances, there are many different options and benefits you can gain from purchasing a refurbished microwave oven. Purchasing a refurbished microwave can save you time and money, while still providing you with a product that performs like new. However, it is important to closely review what you are buying, as not all refurbished microwaves are equal. 

Refurbished microwaves often come with a lower price tag than buying a unit brand new. Because these microwaves have been used before, and then inspected and repaired, companies are able to provide this discounted price. Additionally, because these microwaves have already been used, some sellers will be willing to provide warranties or extended warranties. 

On the downside, many refurbished microwaves may have cosmetic damage or signs of wear. That being said, it is essential to check the condition of the item before you commit to buying, or else you may end up with a microwave that is significantly worse than expected. Additionally, many refurbished microwaves may lack certain features that you typically would get with a new model, such as certain programming options. 

When purchasing a refurbished microwave oven, it is important to take an educated approach and research the item thoroughly to ensure you are getting a product that will meet your needs.
