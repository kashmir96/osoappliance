Appliance dolly rental from Menards is a great way to move heavy appliances with ease. Whether you’re moving into a new home or just need to rearrange your existing appliances, an appliance dolly makes it easier and safer than ever before. Here’s what you need to know about renting an appliance dolly from Menards. 

An appliance dolly is a wheeled platform that can be used to move large and heavy objects like refrigerators, washers, dryers, dishwashers, ovens, and other appliances. It features swivel wheels which allow for easy maneuvering in tight spaces as well as durable construction which makes it ideal for even the heaviest of items. The dolly also comes with straps that secure the item being moved so it won’t shift during transport. 

Menards offers two types of appliance dollies: standard and extended-length models. The standard model is designed for most standard-sized appliances while the extended-length model provides extra room for larger items like refrigerators or washing machines. Both models come with adjustable straps to secure your appliance in place and are available for rent at most Menards stores. 

When you rent an appliance dolly from Menards, you can rest assured that your items will be safely transported. The dolly is designed with a low center of gravity so it won’t tip over, and the straps ensure that it won’t move during transport. Plus, all rental items come with a damage waiver so you don’t have to worry about any unexpected costs should something happen during the move. 

Whether you’re moving into a new home or just want to rearrange your existing appliances, renting an appliance dolly from Menards is an easy and affordable way to get the job done quickly and safely. With adjustable straps and durable construction, you can rest assured that your items will arrive safely at their destination without any hassle or worry.
