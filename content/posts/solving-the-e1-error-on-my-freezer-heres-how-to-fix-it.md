## Fixing the E1 Error on Freezer

If your freezer is displaying an E1 error code, don't panic! Fortunately, this fault is usually easy to fix and doesn't require any expensive tools or escalated service. Read on to learn about the causes of this error and how to rectify it. 

The E1 error code is most often related to the temperature sensors which measure temperatures inside the freezer. This error message can be triggered when these sensors are unable to detect a temperature change. It can also be caused due to the inner climate of the freezer being outside of the appropriate range. 

In order to resolve this issue, the user must first check the temperature settings to confirm that they are not causing the issue. If the temperature levels seem to be alright, the user should next ensure that there's adequate ventilation in the area â€“ if not, locate a cooler spot. Additionally, moving the freezer away from other appliances or heat sources is a good idea as well. 

Once these steps are completed, it's also important to then run a self-diagnosis test on the appliance. This can be done by unplugging the freezer from the power point and waiting for a few minutes before plugging it back in. If the E1 error code persists after going through the process specified above, professional help may be needed.
