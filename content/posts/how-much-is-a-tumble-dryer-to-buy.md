A tumble dryer is an important home appliance that can make a huge difference to how quickly and efficiently you can do your laundry. But with so many different types, models, and prices available, it can be difficult to decide which one is right for you. So how much does a tumble dryer cost?

The price of a tumble dryer will depend on the type, size and features you choose. Generally speaking, a basic vented tumble dryer will start from around £150-200 while condenser and heat pump models tend to cost more at around £250-400. Tumble dryers with smart features such as remote control or voice control will cost over £500.

If you're on a budget but still want the convenience of having your own tumble dryer at home then there are options for those too! There are cheaper basic vented models that often don't have as many bells and whistles but can still get the job done effectively – these usually start from around £100-150. 

It's also worth noting that installation costs may vary depending on the model so it's always important to check this before making your purchase as some models require professional installation in order to run safely and efficiently. 

Overall, when deciding how much is a tumble dryer it’s important to consider all factors such as type, size and additional features in order to get the best value for your money - plus don't forget about installation costs too!
