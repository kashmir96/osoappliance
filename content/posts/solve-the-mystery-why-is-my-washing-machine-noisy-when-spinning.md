## Troubleshooting a Noisy Washing Machine

Do you dread running the washing machine because of the noise and vibrations it causes? If you’re experiencing loud, disruptive noises and wondering why your washing machine is behaving this way, this article can help you figure it out and get back on track with your laundry. 

The first thing to do is unplug the washer, wait 10 minutes and then plug it back in and check to see if it's still noisy. If it continues to be loud, check the leveling of the washer. Having a washing machine out of level will cause it to vibrate more than normal. Take a look at each leg and readjust as needed. Make sure it’s level, not just front to back, but side to side. 

Replace the washer’s shock absorbers if they seem to be cracked or worn. Make sure the load is balanced in the drum. Unbalanced loads of laundry can cause the washer to rumble. When checking the load, look for items like pants or towels that may need to be moved or redistributed. You may need to remove items and reset them in the drum to ensure an even weight around the washer. 

Hoses should also be inspected for any twisted hoses or kinks. Drain lines should also be checked for any blockages that may cause noise. If you find a clog, use a bendy wire or hanger to dislodge it from the line. Anything stuck in the small drain filter at the end of the hose needs to be cleaned out.

Finally, check the washer’s drain pump and make sure it’s secure and not cracked or damaged. Also check for any parts that provide stability for the washer like clamps and bolts, which may also become loose and cause noise. 

If all else fails and you’re still not sure why your washing machine is noisy when spinning, it may be time to contact a professional. Look no further than our [Directory of Appliance Repair Technicians](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) for reliable service.
