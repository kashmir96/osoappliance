## Purpose of the Plastic Piece on Top Rack of Dishwashers
Have you ever noticed a small plastic piece on your dishwasher's uppermost rack? Many consumers often overlook or ignore it, but it’s incredibly important to the health and well-being of your family. This strange little piece is called a rinse aid cap and is a critical part of your dishwasher’s cycle.

Rinse aid is a special solution that works to eliminate left-over drops of water and debris from your dishes, giving them an extra sparkle. In order to prevent waste and over-usage of rinse aid, many dishwashers are equipped with a special cap that acts as a measurer. This cap holds the rinse aid and is dispensed into the dishwasher at the right time and amount.

In order to use the rinse aid, remove the cap and pour the desired amount of rinse aid into the container. When your dishwasher goes through its wash and rinse cycle, the rinse aid will be used up as it is meant to be. Once the rinse aid runs out or is used up, simply fill up the cap once more.

Using a rinse aid helps your dishwasher to be more effective and efficient since it removes the water droplets from the dishes you’ve washed. Plates and glasses will be left spotless, and your family’s health will be safeguarded against the bacteria that collect in standing droplets of water.

Rinse aid also eliminates annoying water spots and calcium buildup, so your dishwasher will remain in top condition. Therefore, the plastic piece on the top rack is a key component in keeping your dishwasher running effectively.

In conclusion, the plastic cap on the top rack of your dishwasher is an important feature. It’s designed to measure and dispense the correct amount of rinse aid, ensuring that your dishwasher works to the best of its ability. Don’t forget to fill it up with the recommended amount of rinse aid every so often for optimal performance.
