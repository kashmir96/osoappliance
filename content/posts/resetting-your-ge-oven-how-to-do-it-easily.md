## Easily Resetting a GE Oven
Have you ever experienced your oven not operating as it should? Resetting it is often the first step to getting everything back to normal. Resetting your GE oven does not have to be difficult. Here is how to do it easily. 

First, locate the tip-over safety switch on the cooktop base of your oven. To reset it, simply push the switch down for a couple of seconds and then release it. This action resets all the settings on your oven. 

Next, ensure that the controls on the front of the oven are all turned off. If not, turn them off. This includes settings such as the temperature controls and the clock.

For any settings that are locked, hold the "Lock" button down until it beeps three times. This should unlock all the controls, allowing you to reset the oven as desired.

Then, press the â€œClear/Off" button on the oven's control panel. This will take the oven settings back to their default levels. You can then reprogram the oven with any settings you would like. 

Resetting your oven has now been completed and the settings for your GE oven should be back to normal.
