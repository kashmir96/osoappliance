# Repair dent on fridge

If your fridge has developed a dent, it can be unsightly and make your kitchen look messy. But you don’t need to replace the appliance just yet — you might be able to repair the dent yourself, saving time and money. Here’s what you need to know about how to repair dents on fridges. 

First things first, check the warranty on your fridge. If it is still under warranty, contact the manufacturer or retailer for assistance. Depending on the type of dent (for example, a dent caused by an impact), they may be willing to repair it free of charge or at a discounted price. 

If your fridge is no longer under warranty or if you would prefer not to contact the manufacturer/retailer for help, there are some DIY methods you can try for repairing dents in fridges: 

One method that can work well is using hot water and dry ice. Take a container of hot water with some dry ice mixed into it and use an old cloth to apply it directly onto the dent in your fridge over several minutes until it is gone. This method works best if you have access to one side of the fridge from inside — otherwise this option won’t be feasible as there is no direct access point to get close enough with the cloth and hot water/dry ice mix. 

Alternatively, if working with hot liquids isn’t an option due to lack of space or where children are present in proximity (as dry ice can cause severe burns when handled incorrectly), then a vacuum cleaner may work instead! Place a vacuum cleaner hose over one side of the dent in order to suck out any air pockets that may have formed due to pressure buildup when creating the initial damage — this should help return some shape back into your refrigerator door! 

Finally, depending on where exactly on your refrigerator door the dent has occurred — its size and depth — using strong adhesive tape may also do wonders at fixing up dents in fridges! Cut two strips off from two ends of adhesive tape large enough so that they cover both sides of each other when placed over top; then press hard until they stick onto each other firmly as well as onto both sides inside/outside areas around where there was once damage on their respective surfaces.  

With these tips and tricks for how-to repair dents on fridges yourself at home without having to pay out for expensive repairs from professionals; hopefully now you can save plenty more money towards buying other household items instead!
