## Upgrade Your Pool With an Electric Heat Pump

Nothing beats a refreshing dip in the pool on a hot summer day, but what happens when the weather turns cold? For pool owners, the thought of high heating bills and unexpected maintenance costs can keep them from enjoying their backyard oasis. Today, electric heat pumps are changing the way homeowners heat their pools, and provide a reliable and efficient way to maximize pool enjoyment. 

An electric heat pump works like a typical air conditioner or refrigerator, but in reverse. It collects heat from its environment and uses it to warm the pool water. This is much more efficient than a traditional electric pool heater, as a heat pump can utilize up to 3 units of energy for every 1 unit used. This translates to considerable savings on heating bills. Even more savings can be had if the heat pump can be connected to a smart home system and programmed to run only during the most cost effective times. 

Beyond savings, electric heat pumps are practically maintenance free. As most of the components are indoors, pool owners have no worries about their heat pump weathering the natural elements. Many models also come with robust warranties and are designed to last up to 15 years. The only routine maintenance that may be required is to routinely clean the filter, which helps keep the unit cooling efficiently.

By investing in an electric heat pump, pool owners can reap the benefits of greater savings and convenience. They can access a reliable and cost effective way to keep their pool at a comfortable temperature all year round.
