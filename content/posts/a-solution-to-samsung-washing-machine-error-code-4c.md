## Fixing Samsung 4C Washing Machine Error Code
Is your Samsung washing machine throwing an E4 or 4C error code? Don't worry, it’s easy to fix. We'll show you how to troubleshoot an error code on a Samsung washing machine.

Error code 4C stands for a problem with the door lock. Your washing machine won't complete a cycle if the door isn't properly closed. First, make sure the door is shut properly. If not, shut the door and try again.

If that fails, you might have a problem with the door switch. This is located behind the control panel and monitors if the machine is empty or full. You can check that the door switch is working properly by unplugging the power cord and then checking the door switch with a multimeter.

If that doesn’t work, you may have a faulty board. To make sure the board is working, disconnect the power supply and run a diagnostic test. The diagnostic test will check the electronic control board and any other components connected to it.

If all of these fail, you should consider replacing the whole door lock assembly. To replace the lock assembly, begin by unscrewing the back panel of the washing machine and then detach the old lock assembly. Install the new lock assembly and then reattach the back panel.

If you’re not comfortable doing any of these repairs yourself, call a professional. They should be able to diagnose and repair the problem quickly.

Error code 4C can be a bit of a hassle but it is possible to fix it yourself. After all steps have been taken, you should be able to get your Samsung washing machine working again in no time.
