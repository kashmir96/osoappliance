## Common Stove Problems

1. Why won't my stove turn on? 
This could be caused by a few things. First, it’s important to make sure that the stove is plugged in correctly and that the circuit breaker has not been tripped. If those both check out, your elements may need to be replaced.

2. Why is only one burner not heating up? 
It’s possible that one burner is not receiving the electricity needed to ignite the heating element. You should first check to make sure that the burner is not clogged with debris. If it is not, then it’s likely an issue with the burner switch needing to be replaced. 

3.Why is there an odor when I turn on the stove? 
An odor could be coming from either the burner switch or the heating elements. It’s common to find that the burner switch has gotten hot over time and may need to be replaced. If the odor persists, the heating element may need to be replaced.

4. Why is only one side of my electric stove heating up? 
This is most likely caused by a defective heating element. You should check the element to see if it appears damaged or burnt. If it does, it should be replaced.

5. How can I clean my stove quickly and efficiently? 
Cleaning your electric stove is simple! You should first remove the burner grates and plates, then wash them using warm, soapy water or a degreasing detergent. Afterward, dampen a cloth with warm water and wipe down all areas of the stovetop.
