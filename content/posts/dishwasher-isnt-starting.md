If your dishwasher isn't starting, there are a few potential causes you should consider. Below are some tips to help you troubleshoot the issue and get your dishwasher running again.

1. Check the power source: Make sure the dishwasher is plugged in and the power is turned on. If the power source is working, you may have a faulty switch or control panel.

2. Check the door latch: Make sure the door is securely closed and the latch is engaged. If the door is open, the dishwasher won't start.

3. Check the water supply: Make sure the water supply is turned on and that the water is hot enough. If the water is not hot enough, the dishwasher won't start.

4. Check the filter: Make sure the filter is clean and free of debris. A clogged filter can prevent the dishwasher from starting.

5. Check the drain hose: Make sure the drain hose is connected and not blocked. If the drain hose is blocked, the dishwasher won't start.

6. Check the water inlet valve: Make sure the water inlet valve is open and that there is no blockage. If the valve is closed or blocked, the dishwasher won't start.

7. Check the start button: Make sure the start button is pressed and that it is not stuck. If the start button is stuck, the dishwasher won't start.

8. Check the timer: Make sure the timer is set correctly and that it is not stuck. If the timer is stuck, the dishwasher won't start.

9. Check the cycle settings: Make sure the cycle settings are correct and that the cycle has been selected. If the cycle is not selected, the dishwasher won't start.

If none of these tips help, it may be time to call a professional to take a look at your dishwasher. A technician can diagnose the issue and provide you with a solution.
