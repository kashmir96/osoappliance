A glass stovetop is a great way to cook, but it can be difficult to keep clean. Grease, food particles and other dirt can quickly accumulate on the surface, making it look dirty and unsightly. However, with the right cleaning products and a few simple steps, you can easily keep your glass stovetop looking shiny and new. 

The first step in cleaning your glass stovetop is to remove all debris from its surface. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe away any crumbs or spills that may be present. Once everything has been wiped away, it’s time to get into the nitty gritty of cleaning the surface. 

To tackle tougher stains or caked-on grease, use an abrasive cleaner such as baking soda or vinegar. Simply mix together some baking soda and water (or vinegar) until you create a paste-like consistency, then apply the mixture directly onto the affected area using a soft cloth or sponge. Scrub gently in circular motions until all dirt and grime have been removed. 

Once you’ve finished scrubbing with an abrasive cleaner, rinse off any residue with warm water and dry thoroughly with a soft cloth or paper towel. If there are still stubborn stains present after this step, you may need to use a glass cooktop cleaner specifically designed for this purpose. These cleaners are typically safe for use on most types of glass stovetops and will effectively dissolve greasy residue without damaging the surface of your appliance. 

Finally, make sure you always use caution when cleaning your glass stovetop by avoiding harsh chemicals that could cause scratches or damage its finish. With regular upkeep using these simple methods, you’ll be able to keep your stovetop looking spotless for years to come!
