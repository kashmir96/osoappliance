If your stove isn't working, don't panic! There are a few simple steps you can take to troubleshoot and identify the source of the problem. 

First, check to see if the stove is plugged in and that it’s receiving power. If it's not plugged in or if the outlet isn't working, then that could be the cause of your stove not working. 

Next, check to see if any of the stove's controls are set incorrectly. If you've recently changed any settings on your stove, it's possible that you may have inadvertently changed something that's preventing it from working correctly. 

If those two steps don't reveal anything, then you may need to take a look at your stove's wiring and components. Start by checking for any signs of damage or wear and tear on the wiring or components. Look for frayed wires, loose connections, burned out fuses or other signs of damage. If you find any problems with the wiring or components, then you'll need to replace them before your stove will work again. 

Finally, if all else fails, then it’s time to call in a professional repairman to take a look at your stove and diagnose the problem. A professional will be able to pinpoint exactly what’s wrong with your stove and provide an effective solution to get it up and running again in no time!
