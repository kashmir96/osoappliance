Hair dryers are a popular tool used to style and dry hair, but they can also cause damage if not used properly. Here are some of the effects of using a hair dryer on your hair. 

1. Damage: When used improperly, using a hair dryer can lead to heat damage that can leave your hair brittle, weak and prone to breakage. Additionally, the heat from the hairdryer dries out the scalp and can cause irritation or even dandruff. 

2. Frizz: Using high temperatures when drying your hair can create frizz as it opens up the follicles and makes them more vulnerable to humidity in the air. If you want to avoid frizzy strands, use lower temperatures or opt for an ionic blow-dryer which helps seal in moisture and reduce static electricity from forming on your hair strands. 

3. Color Fading: High temperatures from hairdryers can also fade color treated or colored hair over time as it strips away natural oils that protect against fading caused by UV rays of sunlight or other environmental factors like chlorine in pools or salt water at beaches etc.. To avoid this happening too quickly use lower settings on your hairdryer and always apply a good quality heat protection spray before blow-drying for added protection against fading color treatments faster than normal rate . 

In conclusion, while using a hairdryer has its benefits such as quick drying times and ease of styling; it is important to remember that improper use could result in damaging effects such as frizziness, dried out scalp irritation/dandruff ,or fading color treatments . Therefore it is best practice to always use low settings when possible , apply heat protection sprays regularly , avoid prolonged exposure with direct heat from any source ,and invest in good quality products like ionic blow-dryers which help reduce static electricity forming on strands .
