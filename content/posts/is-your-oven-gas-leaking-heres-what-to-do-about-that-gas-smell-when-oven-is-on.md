## Dealing with a Gas Leaking Oven

Is your oven giving off a gas smell when you turn it on? Most likely your oven is suffering from a gas leak. Before taking any action, it's important to understand the possible cause of your oven's gas leak, and what steps you should take in order to ensure safety and effective repair.

One of the most common sources of gas leaking from an oven is a faulty gasket. A gasket is an internal part of the oven which ensures heat does not escape. As it ages, the gasket can become worn and begin to stick, allowing natural gas to escape when your oven is on. While gas leaking from your oven is an inconvenience, if the gas is leaking in greater amounts it can be a safety hazard. If you suspect your oven is leaking gas, you should take immediate action.

To ensure your oven is no longer leaking gas, the best course of action is to call an experienced appliance repair technician. A professional will have access to the parts needed for any repairs and have the technical knowledge to inspect your oven for any additional problems. It is also important to remember that any repairs needed may go beyond the gasket.
