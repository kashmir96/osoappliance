## Get Cool with Helpful Tips for Troubleshooting Air Conditioning Problems 

When the summer heat starts to become unbearable, the last thing you need is to be without air conditioning. Issues with air conditioning units can crop up quickly and without warning, leaving you and your family in the uncomfortable heat. Before resorting to calling a repair technician, here are some cool tips for troubleshooting air conditioner problems.

First and foremost, check if the thermostat has been set correctly. If your thermostat has been set on heat, the fan won’t be running and the system won’t deliver cool air. If the temperature is correct, check if the HVAC system is still active. If the air conditioning unit is off and the fan isn’t running, try replacing the fuse or resetting the main circuit breaker.

Next, check the air filter of your air conditioner. Clogged air filters impede the unit’s performance and will prevent cool air from being distributed in the building. If the filter is clogged, clean or change it immediately. If this doesn’t solve the problem, check the outdoor unit’s condenser for any obstruction like leaves, grass, or debris. Any blockage will limit airflow through the unit and reduce its cooling efficiency.

These are some of the basic troubleshooting tips for residential air conditioning systems. In case your system is still not working after following these steps, it’s best to call a qualified repair technician to perform a professional inspection and diagnose the issue.

Having a professional inspect and repair air conditioning problems is the best way to ensure that your system is working properly and efficiently.

## Cool Tips for Troubleshooting Air Conditioning Problems

Q1: What should I do if my air conditioning does not turn on?

A1: Make sure the thermostat is set on the “cool” setting and the temperature is set lower than the current room temperature. Then, check the circuit breaker. If it has been tripped, reset it. If the air conditioner is still not turning on, it may be an issue with the fan motor, compressor, or other system components and you may need to call an HVAC professional.

Q2: Why is air conditioning blowing warm air?

A2: There are several potential causes. First, make sure the thermostat is set correctly to “cool”. We suggest double checking all settings and adjusting the temperature down a few degrees. If the air conditioner is still blowing warm air, it may be a lack of refrigerant or an issue with the compressor. If these are the root cause, then an HVAC technician should be called.

Q3: How can I diagnose an air conditioning system before calling an HVAC technician?

A3: Try to observe any unusual behaviors with the air conditioning system. Check for debris or other items blocking the fins on the outdoor unit. Then, check the air filter and make sure it is not overly dirty or clogged. Also, check all wiring to make sure they are properly connected and functioning.

Q4: Can I repair an air conditioning system without a professional?

A4: Generally it is not recommended to attempt repairs on an air conditioning system without the help of an HVAC professional. An air conditioning system has the potential to be dangerous to work on, so anytime a repair is needed, it is best to contact an HVAC professional.

Q5: How can I increase efficiency of my air conditioning system?

A5: Taking steps to ensure the system is running properly and maximized is the best way to ensure efficiency. Start by checking the air filter and replacing it if necessary. You may also want to seal any air leaks in the home with weather stripping or caulking. Installing shades, blinds, curtains, or drapes on windows can also reduce the amount of sunlight entering the home and improve efficiency.

## Key Takeaways for Troubleshooting Air Conditioning Problems

1. Check if the thermostat is set correctly, and if needed replace the fuse or reset the main circuit.
2. Regularly check the air filter, and replace if clogged to ensure cool air is distributed.
3. Clear any blockages from the condenser outside the unit to improve cooling.
