## Understanding E92 Error Code on Electrolux Dryer
It can be very frustrating to encounter errors while trying to operate an appliance. However, if you own an Electrolux dryer, the appliance manual should have a list of error codes, which can help you to find out the cause and resolve the error.

In this blog, we will take a look at the potential causes and solutions for this error code.

### Potential Causes of E92 Error Code
The main potential cause of the E92 error code issue is due to problems with the control board. The error code can indicate that the board has failed or that it is not operating properly. This can be due to a number of reasons including a faulty power supply, low voltage, a loose connection, or a faulty circuit.

In addition, the issue may be due to problems with the heating element. The heating element is designed to provide the heat needed for the dry cycle. If it is malfunctioning, it can cause the E92 error code. 

### How to Fix an E92 Error Code
The best way to start when solving the E92 error code is to check the power supply and make sure the dryer is properly connected at the block. If there is still no power, you will need to contact your local electrician to help diagnose and repair any potential electrical issues. 

If the power supply is working, you will then need to check the control board. To do this, you may need to contact a qualified appliance technician to help you check the board and make any necessary repairs.

The heating element may also need to be checked. It is important to remember that this should only be done by a qualified technician, as the element can be easily damaged.
