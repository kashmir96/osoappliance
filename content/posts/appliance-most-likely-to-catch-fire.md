We all know that appliances can cause fires if not properly maintained. But which ones are most likely to catch fire? To help you understand the risks and keep your home and family safe, here is a list of the most common appliance fires and how to prevent them.

1. Refrigerators: Refrigerators are the number one cause of appliance fires. Refrigerators are prone to sparking and arcing due to their motor and compressor. Make sure that all cords and wiring are in good condition and not frayed. If you have an older model, itâ€™s a good idea to replace it with a newer, energy-efficient model.

2. Dryers: Dryers are the second-most common appliance fire. Lint buildup is the leading cause of dryer fires. Make sure to clean the lint trap after every use, and periodically clean the inside of the dryer vent.

3. Dishwashers: Dishwashers are known to cause fires due to their high-temperature wash cycles. Make sure to clean the dishwasher filter and spray arm regularly, and to clean the inside of the dishwasher with a dishwasher cleaner.

4. Washing Machines: Washing machines can cause fires due to their electrical wiring, which can become overheated. Make sure to check the wiring for any signs of damage, and if you have an older model, consider replacing it with a newer, energy-efficient model.

5. Microwaves: Microwaves are the fifth most common appliance fire. Make sure to keep all food containers away from the walls of the microwave, and make sure to clean the interior of the microwave regularly.

By understanding which appliances are most likely to cause fires, you can take the necessary steps to reduce the risk of having a fire in your home. Make sure to inspect your appliances regularly and replace any damaged wiring or cords. Also, make sure to keep your home free of clutter and combustible materials, and install smoke alarms throughout your home. With these simple steps, you can help to keep your home and family safe.
