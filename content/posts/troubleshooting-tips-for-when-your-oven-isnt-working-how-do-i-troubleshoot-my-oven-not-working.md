## Troubleshooting a Non-Functional Oven
Has your oven stopped working? Don’t panic! It’s easier than you think to troubleshoot and diagnose the issue. Many times, this is just a minor issue that can be resolved with a few simple adjustments. Here are some troubleshooting tips for when your oven isn’t working.

First, check to make sure your oven is on and that it’s plugged in. Sounds obvious, but you’d be surprised how many times this is the solution to the problem. If it’s plugged in, but still not running, try resetting the circuit breaker or replacing the fuses.

Next, try cleaning the oven. Food and grease can easily build up and create a blockage, which will prevent your oven from working. Use a damp cloth or sponge to clean the interior and exterior of the oven, as well as the door.

If your oven is still not working, it’s best to hire a professional to inspect and diagnose the problem. They may be able to replace a fuse, replace the heating element, unblock the pipes, or make other adjustments to get your oven back to functioning its best.

No matter the problem, having a malfunctioning oven is a hassle. However, with the right self-repair or professional help, you’ll have it working again in no time.
