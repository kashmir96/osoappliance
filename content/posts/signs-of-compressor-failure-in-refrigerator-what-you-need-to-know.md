## Recognize the Symptoms of Refrigerator Compressor Failure
Compressors are the workhorses of a refrigerator, and when they fail, the refrigerator stops performing its essential job of keeping food cold. Understanding the signs of compressor failure is essential to helping you diagnose problems in your refrigerator and maintain a healthy refrigerator.

### Causes of Refrigerator Compressor Failure 
A refrigerator compressor typically fails due to excessive wear and tear, age, or an overload from a power surge. While sometimes a repair can be made, in some cases, it may be more economically sound to replace the entire refrigerator.

### Signs of Refrigerator Compressor Failure
If your refrigerator isnâ€™t working properly, it may be a sign that the compressor is failing or has already failed. Here are some signs to look out for:

* A sudden increase in noise - If the compressor starts to make loud and unusual noises, it may be a sign that the pump inside is wearing out.

* Refrigerator suddenly stops running - If the refrigerator suddenly stops running, it's possible the compressor is beginning to fail, particularly if the compressor fan is still running.

* Intermittent cooling - If your refrigerator is only cooling intermittently or not cooling at all, then it could be a compressor failure.

* Constantly running compressor - If the compressor is running for long periods of time without turning off, then it could be an indication that the compressor is failing.

### Understanding Your Refrigerator Compressor
In order to diagnose and repair a problem with your refrigerator compressor, it pays to understand how the compressor works. The compressor is the component that pumps refrigerant gas throughout the refrigerator to maintain the appropriate temperature. It is powered by a motor and will ultimately wear down just like any part subject to motion. 

### Dealing with Compressor Failure
If you think your refrigerator compressor has failed, it is best to consult a professional technician in order to determine how to proceed. Depending on the age, make and model of your refrigerator, it may make more economical sense to replace the entire refrigerator. Be sure to consult the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to determine the source of the problem quickly and easily.

Compressors are the cornerstone of a refrigerator, and understanding the signs of compressor failure can help you maintain a healthy and efficient refrigerator. Keeping an eye out for the symptoms listed above can help you diagnose and address a refrigerator compressor failure quickly and cost-effectively. If you are experiencing problems with your refrigerator and think it may have to do with a compressor failure, be sure to consult the [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for fast and efficient troubleshooting.
