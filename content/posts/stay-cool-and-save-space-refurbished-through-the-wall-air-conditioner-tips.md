##Tips for Shopping for a Refurbished Through the Wall Air Conditioner

When the summers heat up, staying cool and comfortable indoors can be challenging. Installing a through the wall air conditioner can provide an efficient and dependable solution to indoor air quality. Here, we are going to provide tips on shopping for a refurbished through the wall air conditioner. 

When considering a through the wall air conditioner, it is important to note the BTU ratings. To ensure that the air conditioner is adequate for cooling spaces, one should calculate the spaceâ€™s cooling needs and find an air conditioner that has a rating that is 150 to 600 BTUs higher. For example, if the space needs a 6,000 BTU air conditioner, finding one rated 7,000 BTUs is necessary. 

An important feature of a through the wall air conditioner to consider is a dehumidifier mode. This can be a great money saver because when the air conditioner is set with the dehumidifier mode on, the air conditioner will shut off when humidity levels have been reached. This saves energy overall by running the ac only when needed. 

A final key feature to note is that the installation of a through the wall air conditioner requires some electrical or carpentry experience.
