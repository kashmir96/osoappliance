## Delving into the Inner-workings of a Kettle
Electric kettles are an essential part of many households, from the first cup of coffee in the morning to a soothing cup of tea in the evening. But do you know what powers your kettle? Most kettles use various electrical components to operate, and understanding what they do can help you appreciate just how useful they are. 

The heating element is perhaps the main component of an electric kettle. These are designed as either coils or strips that are wrapped around or inserted into the base of the kettle. When powered by electricity, they produce a great amount of heat in a very fast amount of time. This heat is then transferred to the water, so it quickly boils. 

The power cable is a second component that is responsible for delivering electricity to the heating element. These are usually long and flexible to make them easy to store, and are equipped with plugs that are compatible with the electrical outlet. The power cable is also used to transfer power from the outlet to the kettle itself, so the heating element is able to do its job.

The power switch is an important component as it allows you to safely turn the kettle on and off. These switches tend to be located on the handle of the kettle and have a safety feature that requires the switch to be held down for a few seconds before the heating element turns on. This ensures that your kettle wonâ€™t start heating up if you forget to close it. 

The thermostat is the final component that helps an electric kettle operate. It is responsible for shuttling off the power when the water has reached a certain temperature. This prevents the water from boiling over and potentially burning you. The thermostat also helps to regulate the temperature of the water, so it stays at a consistent level regardless of how long it's been boiling. 

Electric kettles are an essential part of many households and understanding the electrical components that power them can help you better appreciate the wonders of modern technology. If you're looking for a new electric appliance, check out our overview of the top appliances available today.
