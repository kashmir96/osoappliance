## Understanding the Fix to a Broken Coil Fan in an Air Conditioner
When you’re relying on an air conditioner to keep your home comfortable on hot summer days, the last thing you want is to find that the coil fan is broken. Fortunately, if you understand a few basics, you can fix this issue yourself or contact a professional from the [Appliance Repair Directory - Christchurch](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians/new-zealand/christchurch).

The majority of air conditioners these days use an evaporator coil to cool the air. This coil is connected to a fan that draws air across the fins of the coil to help the air cool faster. Over time, these fans can become broken due to normal wear and tear. The most common cause of a broken fan is due to an accumulation of dust, dirt, and debris inside the fan's motor housing.

Once the fan is disconnected, open the fan panel and inspect the fan’s motor and bearings. Clean the motor and bearings using a vacuum and compressed air. If the fan still won’t work after cleaning, then it is time to replace the fan and its components. This will typically require purchasing a new fan, connection cable and installation tools. Having these tools will make the process much easier and help you replace the fan and its components quickly.

Once the fan is replaced and re-installed, turn on the power and test the fan again. If the fan works, then your new fan is installed and operating properly. However, if the fan still isn't working it’s time to call in a certified air conditioning technician to complete the job.

Fixing a broken coil fan in an air conditioner can be quick and easy if you know the right steps. If you don’t feel comfortable tackling the problem on your own, contact a certified technician from the [Appliance Repair Directory - Christchurch](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians/new-zealand/christchurch) to get the job done right. They will have the skills and resources to repair any type of air conditioner to keep your home cool and comfortable.
