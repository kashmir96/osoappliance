## Examining Noisy Washer Spins: Find the Root of the Problem
A noisy washer can be an incredibly annoying problem - your appliance is making enough noise to fill the entire house. But discovering the source of the noise is key to solving the problem. In this blog we will look at the different causes of noisiness and what you can do to resolve the issue.

When your washer is making too much noise during its spin cycle, there are a variety of potential culprits. The most common causes of noisy spinning is a broken or unbalanced drum or a worn out belt, but there can also be other causes. To determine the source of the rattling and humming, first it is important to identify the exact type of noise. A shaking, vibrating sound could indicate an unbalanced drum, while humming or buzzing could point to a more complex issue.

Once you understand the type of noise, the next step is to consider what may have caused it. It is possible that wear and tear is the culprit, as washers are made up of several moving parts that can show signs of slight deterioration over time. Alternatively, it is possible that the drum of the machine is unbalanced or the belt has snapped.

Inspecting the different pieces of the machine is the best way to start to narrow down the exact source of the issue. Start by removing the rear panel to access the drive belt. Check the motion of the belt itself, paying attention to any signs of damage or fraying. If there are no signs of wear, move on to the drum by opening the door and checking for signs of damage or misalignment. 

Finally, inspect the balance of the machine by checking the levelers located at the bottom of the washer. A bubble level is a helpful tool for this as it will tell you if the washer is level. If the washer is not level, there may be an issue with the floor.

Once you have narrowed it down to a few potential possibilities, you may consider hiring a professional appliance repair technician to complete the work and restore your washer to its former glory.
