## Unlocking the Mystery of Washer Codes

Understanding the codes that your washing machine produces can be tricky. Fortunately, you can use the codes to troubleshoot problems and potentially save time and money from having to call an appliance repair technician. In this blog we'll explain what each code means and how to interpret them.

Modern washing machines are built with a host of features and controls. Unfortunately, when a problem occurs, the machine’s control panel may display an error code to alert you of the issue. These code letters, numbers and symbols can be confusing, but they are actually designed to help you identify the cause of the problem. 

Different washers have different codes. To find out which codes are associated with your washer, look up the model number in the user manual or online. Once you know which code means what, reading them is a piece of cake. 

Common codes are usually related to certain problems that are associated with a particular washer type. The control will usually display an "E" if the load is unbalanced, while a "F" usually indicates a problem with the door latch. Other codes, like "LF" or "UL", might indicate the unit is having trouble filling or draining. 

If your washer displays a code that isn't listed in the manual or you're unsure what the code means, you can always look it up in our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). This reference guide is a great resource for identifying problem codes and troubleshooting issues.

With just a bit of research and a helpful resource like our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary, you can easily decipher and solve the issue quickly.
