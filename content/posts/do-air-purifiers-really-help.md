Air purifiers have become increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more people are looking for ways to improve the air quality in their homes. But do air purifiers really help? 

The answer depends on a few factors, such as what type of air purifier you are using, the size and layout of your home or office, and the level of pollutants present in your environment. 

To start off, let’s look at what an air purifier does. An air purifier typically works by filtering out airborne contaminants such as dust, pollen, pet dander, smoke particles, and other allergens. Some units also use ionizers or ultraviolet (UV) light to reduce bacteria and viruses from circulating in the air. By trapping these particles before they enter our breathing zone, an air purifier can help reduce symptoms from allergies and asthma. 

Air purifiers can also reduce odors by trapping airborne molecules that cause smells. This is especially helpful for helping to control pet odors or cooking smells in kitchens or bathrooms. Many models also come with activated charcoal filters which can be particularly effective for removing unpleasant odors from tobacco smoke or paint fumes. 

Now that we know how an air purifier works, let’s look at how well it works at improving indoor air quality (IAQ). Generally speaking, the effectiveness of an air purifier will depend on several factors including: 

 - The size of your space – larger rooms need more powerful units with higher CADR ratings; 

 - The type of filter used – some filters may be better suited than others for specific pollutants; and 

 - The level of contaminants present in your environment – if there is a high level of allergens or other airborne particles present then you may need a more powerful unit to really make a difference. 

Overall if you are looking to improve IAQ then investing in a good-quality HEPA filter-based unit is probably your best bet. These types of filters have been proven to capture 99%+ of airborne particles down to 0.3 microns so they are very effective when it comes to reducing allergens and other irritants from circulation around your home or workplace
