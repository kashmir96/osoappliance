## Tumble Dryer Scrap Values Going Down

The scrap value of tumble dryers across the world is tumbling, and the reasons why vary from country to country. In this blog, we'll explore some of the most commonly cited reasons for the drop in scrap values and discuss the implications for your household appliance appliances. 

One of the primary factors contributing to the falling scrap value of tumble dryers is the age and condition of the existing stock. With older models usually fetching a lower scrap value than brand-new units, the used tumble dryer market is beginning to depreciate. In addition, new models have much better energy efficiency and longer lifespans, which is not only making them cheaper to run but is also reducing the scrap value of their predecessors. 

Another factor impacting the scrap value of tumble dryers is the prevalence of more advanced and efficient technologies entering the market. In particular, heat pump tumble dryers are becoming increasingly popular, managing to dry clothes up to 30 percent faster and using up to 20 percent less energy than the models that came before them. With energy efficiency playing an increasingly important role in appliance purchase decisions, manufacturers of those older models simply can't compete with the newer, more efficient technologies. 

In addition, the rising cost of parts is also having an impact. As the cost of spare parts increases, it's becoming harder and harder to repair older tumble dryers and a fewer people are prepared to pay extra money to make these repairs. As a result, the scrap value of these models continues to fall. 

The declining scrap value of tumble dryers has implications for both homeowners and manufacturers. On one hand, those with older models must weigh the cost of repair against the scrap value of their dryer. On the other hand, manufacturers of the older models are being forced to lower the scrap value of their wares in order to remain competitive in the market.

## FAQ on Tumble Dryers and the Declining Resale Value

1. **What is causing the scrap value for tumble dryers to decline?**
The scrap value for tumble dryers is declining primarily due to two reasons. Firstly, the cost of new tumble dryers is coming down significantly, meaning that people are more likely to choose to buy the new models rather than the second hand ones. Secondly, some older models have been deemed unsafe and are being recalled by manufacturers. 

2. **Are dryers being recalled due to safety concerns?**
Yes, some dryers have been recalled by manufacturers due to safety concerns. It is important to check if your tumble dryer is affected by any such recalls and to act promptly if so, as it could put you and your family in danger. 

3. **What should I do if my tumble dryer is affected by a safety recall?**
You should follow the instructions of the recall carefully and take quick action to remedy the situation. Depending on the severity of the safety recall, it may be necessary to switch off the appliance immediately, contact the manufacturer to arrange for a technician to come and to install a replacement part and then book an additional appointment for the technician to come and review the work. 

4. **Should I repair my tumble dryer if it breaks down?**
It may be worth considering repairing the dryer, depending on the age of the appliance and the cost involved with the repair. Generally, if the appliance is over 8 years old and the cost of the repair is more than half the cost of a new model, itâ€™s not worth repairing it. 

5. **Are there any alternate uses for my old tumble dryer?**
Yes, your old tumble dryer can be recycled and repurposed into a plethora of new uses. Old tumble dryers can be transformed into outdoor storage spaces, photo-booth backdrops and even mini-greenhouses. So, with a bit of creativity, you can give your old tumble dryer a new lease of life.
