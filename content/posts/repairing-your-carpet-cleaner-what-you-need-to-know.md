## Maintaining Your Carpet Cleaner 
Owning a carpet cleaner is a convenient and cost-efficient way to keep your carpets clean and free of allergens and dirt. Unfortunately, all machines require maintenance and repairs from time to time. To make sure that your carpet cleaner is always in peak condition and functioning correctly, it’s important to know the basics of maintaining and repairing it. This blog post will cover the essentials of carpet cleaner repairs and maintenance so that you can feel confident in taking good care of your appliance. 

The first step in maintaining your carpet cleaner is to empty the water reservoirs after each use. You should also make sure that the brushes, hoses, and filters are also cleaned to keep your machine running properly. Regularly checking your carpet cleaner for debris like pet hair and fibers is also a great way to not only prevent performance issues, but to also keep your carpets looking their best. 

Occasionally, your carpet cleaner may need additional repairs and parts that require replacing. If your suction is weak, you may need to change your filters. If the brushes aren’t spinning, then the brush belt may need replacing. If the hoses are clogged, you may need to clean or replace them. While some repairs are fairly simple and can be done by the average consumer, other repairs may best be left to trained technicians who understand the specifics of your particular appliance. 

Taking good care of your carpet cleaner is essential to keeping your carpets clean, fresh, and looking great. By making sure that you regularly empty the water reservoirs and check the brushes, hoses, and filters, as well as by adhering to the manufacturer’s maintenance schedule, you’ll keep your machine running optimally.
