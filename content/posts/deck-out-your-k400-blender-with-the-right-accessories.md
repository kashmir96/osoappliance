## Enhance Your K400 Blender Experience With the Right Accessories 
Using an immersion blender for making smoothies or preparing delicious soups and sauces is an invaluable tool for many cooks. The K400 blender is an effective, durable and customizable tool for any kitchen. Taking the time to outfit your K400 with the right accessories can give you an even better experience with an even more powerful resulting performance. 

One of the most helpful accessories for your K400 is the wall mount. Installed vertically on the wall, it keeps the blender organized and off your countertop, freeing up valuable workspace. Using the right accessories in combination with your K400 blender also makes sure that each piece of equipment is specialized for the job it needs to do. One such example is the whisk attachment. It not only makes it faster to whip cream and egg whites, but also works steadily to incorporate delicate ingredients like cheese, chocolate, and fish into your recipes. An added benefit to buying a quality blender that has the right accessories is the flexibility it gives you in the range of uses. 

Having all the right accessories to go along with your K400 blender can really help boost your culinary experience. The right whisk attachment, for example, can help you create mini works of art out of multiple ingredients you are combining. It helps you achieve lightweight and delicate whipped cream, mousses and sauces, or a light and airy meringue. The wall mount gives you easy and quick access to your K400 blender, making for a faster and more efficient process. 

For any cook looking for a multi-functional and durable blender, the K400 with the right accessories is an excellent choice. Use the higher-level attachments to take your culinary endeavors to the next level. Get creative and finally be able to make recipes come to life the way you want them.
