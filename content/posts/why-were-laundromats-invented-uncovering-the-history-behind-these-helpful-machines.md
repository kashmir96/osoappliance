## Uncovering the History Behind Laundromats
With the convenience of easily accessible laundromats available today, one may not think to ask how these machines first came to be. We are all familiar with the idea of washing laundry at home, but what inspired inventors to bring this concept outside the home? Uncovering the history of laundromats can give us greater insight into the journey of these invaluable machines.

The invention of the first commercial laundromat is attributed to J. F. Cantrell in the year 1934. He was inspired to create his first laundromat--or “Washette”--in Fort Worth, Texas after seeing the difficulty customers had in cleaning their clothes. He designed his laundry machines to be coin-operated to make it easier for customers to use them. This required customers to bring their own laundering supplies, and Cantrell rented out the machines on a weekly basis. 

The public welcomed the idea of coin-operated machines with open arms. Laundromats quickly spread all across the United States, and they eventually caught the attention of others beyond America's shores. By the mid-1950s, manufacturers were producing specialized equipment to make laundry easier and faster. While the first machines used were coin-operated, modern versions now use cards or contactless payments, eliminating the need to carry around coins. 

Today, laundromats are a vital part of many households all over the world. With the introduction of energy-efficient machines, they have become increasingly popular with those who don’t have a washing machine or dryer in their homes. Even with the growth of technology, some people may opt for the traditional laundromat option for their laundry due to its convenience and affordability. 

Laundromats have been an invaluable part of the everyday life. They have made it possible for those without the resources to keep their belongings clean and hygienic in an efficient and cost-effective way.
