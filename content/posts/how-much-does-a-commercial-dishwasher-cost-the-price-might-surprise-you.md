## Commercial Dishwasher Cost Can Fit Within Any Budget
There are many advantages to having a commercial dishwasher in a home kitchen. From being able to safely and quickly clean and sanitize dishes, to being more energy efficient than washing dishes in the sink, commercial dishwashers can be a great addition to any home. But when it comes to purchasing one, many people are surprised at the cost. 

The price of a commercial dishwasher depends on a variety of variables, including size, features and your budget. The smallest models tend to be less expensive, and come with fewer features. However, you don't need to worry about spending too much; there is a wide range of prices, depending on the features and types of dishwasher you are looking for.

Below are a few of the different types of commercial dishwashers on the market, as well as their price range:

* High-temperature commercial dishwasher: Starts at approximately $1,400 and tops out at around $15,000.

* Low temperature commercial dishwasher: Starts at about $1,500 and can range up to $12,500.

* Rack conveyor dishwasher: Starts at about $4,000 and can reach up to $40,000, depending on the size and features.

* Undercounter commercial dishwasher: Starts at around $1,200 and can range up to $3,000.

With such a wide range of prices, you're sure to find an option that fits your budget. Plus, if you shop around, compare features and read reviews, you may be able to find even lower prices. 

Your investment in a commercial dishwasher can pay off in the long run, as it can help you save money and time in the kitchen. Not only is it faster than hand-washing dishes, but it can also help you conserve water, save on energy costs, and extend the life of your dishes.
