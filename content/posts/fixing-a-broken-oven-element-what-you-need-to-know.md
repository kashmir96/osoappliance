## Fixing a Broken Oven Element - Everything You Need to Know

If you’ve ever had to deal with a broken oven element, you know exactly how frustrating it can be. Not being able to cook a meal or avoiding using your oven until you've had it fixed can really put a halt to your everyday life. Fortunately, there are a few steps that you can take to troubleshoot and repair the problem without needing to call in a specialist. 

The first thing you should do is to check the circuit breaker. If it has tripped, reset it. If it trips again, then this could signal a more serious issue, such as a short circuit or a problem with the wiring. It’s best to call a qualified technician in this case to repair the issue safely.

For a simpler issue, such as a broken element, you can usually replace it pretty easily. Make sure to unplug your oven before getting started. To replace the element, you will need to open up the back panels of the oven and use a Phillips-head screwdriver to unscrew the element. Then, you can unscrew the bolts that are holding the element in place and remove it.

At this point, you can take the broken element to the hardware store to find an exact replacement. If you’re unsure which element to purchase, it’s best to bring the old element with you, so a staff member can match it up. When you return home, simply attach the new element and replace the panels.

Lastly, make sure your oven is plugged back in to test it out. If it’s still not working correctly, you may need to get a qualified technician to take a look.
