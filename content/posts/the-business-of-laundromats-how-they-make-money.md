Laundromats are a convenient way for people to wash their clothes without the hassle of having to own and maintain a home washing machine. This type of business has been around since the 1950s and continues to be popular today. But how do laundromats actually make money? The answer lies in a combination of services, products, and fees. 

One way laundromats make money is by charging customers for using their washing machines and dryers. Depending on the size, type, and age of the machines, they typically cost anywhere from $1-$3 per load. Additionally, many laundromats also offer coin-operated vending machines which provide customers with detergent, fabric softener sheets, bleach, stain remover sprays etc., at an additional cost. 

Another way that laundromats generate revenue is through services such as folding clothes or offering pickup/delivery options for those unable to come into the store themselves. These types of services can either be offered for free or charged depending on how much time it takes staff to complete them each day. For instance some stores may charge an extra fee for folding shirts while others may simply fold them as part of their regular service package at no extra charge. 

Aside from these two methods of generating income there is also potential to sell other merchandise such as snacks or drinks in order to further increase profits from customers coming into your store daily looking for a place to clean their laundry items quickly and conveniently without having access to a washer/dryer at home or work place environment! 

Finally because most laundromats offer extended hours throughout the week they often take advantage by hosting events such as movie nights or bingo nights within their spaces which can bring in additional revenue through ticket sales or food/beverage purchases made by those attending! As you can see there are many different ways that one can go about monetizing a traditional Laundromat business model – it’s just important not forget about any potential options when considering how best make money off this type venture!
