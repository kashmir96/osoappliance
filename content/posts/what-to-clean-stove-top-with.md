When it comes to cleaning your stove top, it’s important to use the right products and techniques so that you don’t damage the surface. The type of stove top you have will determine the best cleaning method, so make sure you read your owner’s manual before beginning. Here are some tips for cleaning a range of stove tops:

Glass-top stoves: Start by removing any food debris or particles from the surface with a damp cloth or sponge. Once all large pieces are gone, spray on a glass cleaner specifically designed for stove tops and wipe with a soft cloth in circular motions. If there are still areas with stubborn grime, sprinkle baking soda over them and scrub gently with a sponge or cloth soaked in warm water. Rinse with clean water and dry thoroughly with a microfiber cloth.

Gas stoves: Begin by turning off the gas supply to the burners and remove any burner grates or caps. Then use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the surface, paying special attention to areas around knobs and dials that can trap grease and dirt easily. Once all visible residue is gone, use an all-purpose cleaner sprayed onto a soft cloth to degrease more stubborn spots such as burners or knobs. Finally, rinse off any remaining cleaner residue with clean water and dry thoroughly with a microfiber cloth.

Electric stoves: Start by unplugging your appliance from the wall socket before cleaning its surface. Use warm water mixed with dish soap (or an all-purpose cleaner) to remove dirt and grease from the surface of your electric stove top – just make sure not to soak too much liquid into cracks as this could damage electrical components inside! Once done wiping down, rinse off any remaining suds using clean water then dry thoroughly using a microfiber cloth – making sure no dampness remains on any electrical components such as igniters or heating elements which could cause short circuits if left wet! 

No matter what type of stove top you have, remember that regular maintenance is key for keeping it looking its best! Cleaning regularly will help prevent built up dirt and grease which can be difficult to remove if left too long!
