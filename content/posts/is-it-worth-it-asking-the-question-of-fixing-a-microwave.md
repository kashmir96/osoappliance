## Weighing The Cost vs Benefits of Microwave Repairs 

We've all encountered one at one point or another: a microwave oven that has broken down. Is it worth it trying to repair it or it is better to replace the appliance? All too often, households must consider the cost-benefit ratio of repairing a microwave oven, or purchasing a new one. 

The decision to repair or replace a broken-down oven will depend on several factors. First, consider if there is warranty still remaining on the unit. If the appliance is still under warranty, then it will likely be free of charge to service or sometimes even receive a replacement. That can be a valuable benefit, you’ll want to consider when making will be making your decision.

Stephen, a major appliance service tech is experienced in making these choices when it comes to microwaves. “If it’s a real simple repair - a bad door switch or something like that, it’s probably worth fixing. But if the inverter board is out or you’ve got problems with multiple components, replacing it’s probably going to be the way to go.”

Moreover, it is also important to consider your usage and needs. If you are in a household of two or three who use the microwave often, then you might need to replace the old oven with a new one regardless of the warranty status.

If your research indicates you need parts for a repair and it does not fall under warranty, look for universal parts for the job. Universal parts are more expensive than OEM parts, but still cheaper than buying a brand-new replacement. 

Finally, consider whether you have the skills and knowledge to do the job. If you have extensive background and experience in repair, then it may be worth trying to perform the repair yourself. However, if you do not have the knowledge and skills, or the time to do it, than leaving the job to the professionals might be your best option. 

Weighing the cost vs benefits can be challenging when it comes to repairing or replacing a microwave. Consider the warranty status of the appliance, parts availability, and experience to make the best decision for your household needs.
