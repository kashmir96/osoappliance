Laundry service is an important part of the hotel industry. It is used to clean and maintain the uniforms, linens, and towels used by hotel guests and employees. Laundry service can also be used to clean other items such as curtains, carpets, and upholstery.

There are a few different types of laundry service that can be offered in a hotel. The most common type is called wet cleaning. Wet cleaning involves using a detergent or solvent to clean the item. The item is then rinsed with water to remove the detergent or solvent. Another type of laundry service is called dry cleaning. Dry cleaning uses a chemical solvent instead of water to clean the item. The solvent is then removed from the item by blowing hot air over it.

Most hotels rely on outside contractors to provide their laundry services. These contractors usually have specialized equipment and staff that are trained in how to properly clean hotel linens and uniforms. Hotels typically have contracts with these contractors that specify what items need to be cleaned, how often they need to be cleaned, and what type of cleaning process should be used.
