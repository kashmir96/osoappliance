## Fixing Issues with Your Washing Machine
For the average homeowner, an occasional hiccup with a washing machine isn't out of the ordinary, but making sure it's quickly resolved is key to keeping your laundry running smoothly. A few simple checks can help you diagnose problems with your washing machine and restore order to your weekly chores.

### Check the Water Supply
For your washing machine to function optimally, there needs to be sufficient water pressure and when the pressure is low it will affect the appliance’s ability to soak and rinse clothes properly. If water is not entering the washer, check the inlet hose and ensure the washing machine valve is fully open and allowing water in. You can also verify the pressure coming out of the hose. If none of these steps does the trick, then it may be time to contact a professional appliance repair technician for further inspection.

### Take a Look at the Motor
If your machine is not spinning, agitating, or draining correctly during a cycle, then the motor may need to be examined. Make sure to check the motor regularly and see if there are any blockages and if the belt connecting elements of the motor to the washer is loose or detached. Because of the complexity and risk of electric shocks that come along with checking out the motor, it is wise to call a professional service technician who can diagnose and fix the issue.

### Pay Attention To Your Laundry Habits
Sometimes, the solution to a washing machine problem isn't about the machine itself, but rather your usage habits. If you have noticed that your washer is beginning to overflow, then the chances are you are overstuffing the drum. Overloading can damage the appliance, so it’s important to limit yourself to the proper amount of clothing per load.

### Get Professional Assistance
It is understandable you want to try and fix the issue with your washing machine yourself, but sometimes it's in your best interest to seek professional help. Qualified appliance repair technicians have the experience and tools needed to identify the source of the problem. The sooner you get help, the faster the repair and resolution.

In order to keep your laundry routine running smoothly, make sure to stay aware of your washing machine’s performance and address any issues that might arise. The earlier the problem is detected, the more likely you are to make a full and quick recovery. If the DIY approach fails, then the best option is to turn to a trusted professional.

## Tips for Troubleshooting Problems with Your Washing Machine

1. How do I know when my washing machine needs maintenance? 
 If you are noticing frequent errors or problems with your washing machine, it may be time to have it serviced or inspected. Additionally, if you’re noticing any changes in your washing machine’s performance or a decrease in its cleaning quality, it could also be time for maintenance or a repair.

2. Should I attempt to repair my washing machine myself?
 We recommend leaving the repair and maintenance to a licensed washing machine specialist. DIY washing machine repairs can often do more harm than good and can void your manufacturer’s warranty.

3. How much does it cost to fix a washing machine? 
 The costs to fix major issues in a washing machine can vary depending on the cause, model, and parts and labor needed. Most washing machine repairs will cost around $100-200, but could be higher or lower depending on the issue.

4. What causes a washing machine to leak? 
 Washing machine leaks are usually caused by one of 3 problems: a worn-out door seal, an issue with the connections of the hoses, or a problem with the inner tub.

5. How can I prevent problems with my washing machine? 
 Regular maintenance and cleaning are the best ways to help prevent any issues with your washing machine. Clean your washing machine’s filter and hoses regularly, use the proper type and amount of detergent and only run the machine when it’s full. Additionally, to help prolong its life, store your washer in a dry place and use a soft mat or platform underneath to help absorb vibrations.
