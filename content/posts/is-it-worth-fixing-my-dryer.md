# Is it worth fixing my dryer

If your dryer is on its last legs, you may be wondering if it’s worth fixing or if you should replace it. This is a difficult decision to make and there are a few factors that can help you decide which route to go. 

One factor to consider is the age of your dryer. If it’s an older model, chances are that repairing it could be more expensive than replacing it with something newer and more energy efficient. You should also consider the cost of repairing vs. buying a new one - if the repair cost is significantly higher than the price of a new model, then replacing is probably the better option. 

You should also think about how often you use your dryer, as this will have an effect on whether or not repairing makes sense financially. If you only run one or two loads each week, buying a new machine may not be worth the money since you won’t get much use out of it before needing another repair down the line. On the other hand, if you rely heavily on your dryer and use it multiple times per week, then investing in repairs now can save you money in the long run as opposed to constantly having to buy replacements every few years due to wear and tear from excessive use. 

Finally, think about how important having a working dryer is for your lifestyle - do you have any other options for drying clothes such as hanging them up outside or using an alternate appliance? If not, then investing in repairs might be worthwhile since not being able to get by without one could cause major inconveniences in your life. 

Ultimately, deciding whether or not to fix your dryer comes down to personal preference and finances - there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer for everyone since every situation is different. Consider all of these factors before making any hasty decisions so that you can make an informed decision that will benefit both your wallet and lifestyle!
