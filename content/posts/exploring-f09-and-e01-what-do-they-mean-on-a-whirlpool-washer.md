## Unraveling the Mystery of Whirlpool Washer Error Codes F09 and E01

When a modern washing machine malfunctions, you may find that it displays an error message, usually consisting of a combination of letters and numbers. These codes provide hints as to what has gone wrong, so that you can troubleshoot and, hopefully, fix the issue. In this post, we’ll explain what Whirlpool washer error codes “F09” and “E01” mean.

Error code F09 typically indicates a problem with the motor. If a Whirlpool washer experiences this error, it’s likely that the motor rotor position sensor has failed (RPS). This sensor is responsible for monitoring the position of the motor rotor in your appliance. When it fails, your washing machine won't be able to complete any cycles.

Error code E01 is a related issue. It may indicate that the motor or motor control has failed. This can occur when one of the motor’s components doesn’t respond to changes in frequency or rotation. This can be a more complex problem caused by either a computer board failure or an actual motor malfunction.

Ultimately, the causes of both error codes can be traced to the appliance’s motor. Fortunately, such a motor is a repairable part - but professional help will be needed to access and replace it.
