## Charting the Most Common Kitchen Appliances

When it comes to kitchen appliances, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to deciding which ones are necessary for your home. But depending on what you’re trying to accomplish – from simple dinners to complex meals – there are certain appliances that are sure to make life easier. Understanding which kitchen appliances are the biggest game changers can be important when you decide to invest in a new appliance or remodel your kitchen. 

The two most popular and most essential kitchen appliances are the refrigerator and range combination. This duo can handle the daily essentials involved in meal preparation, such as storing food and cooking it. Other major kitchen appliances that help meal preparation run smoothly are the dishwasher, microwave and oven. These appliances are meant to help clean up and cook food faster, as well as help with storage. 

Additionally, small kitchen appliances can make meal prep more efficient. Popular small kitchen appliances such as blenders, toasters and slow cookers can help make food preparation run smoother. Small kitchen appliances are also often more affordable and thus more accessible to people with a smaller budget. If you’re looking for more specialized cooking, stand mixers can help you whip up flavorful dishes that can be served easily and quickly.

No matter what type of kitchen appliance you’re in the market for, it’s important to recognize that real kitchen magic doesn’t exclusively come from major or small appliances, but rather from the person behind them. Knowing how to use each appliance in recipes and creative ways can instantly make meal prep easier and more enjoyable.
