If you have a gas stove, it's important to know where to light the burner. Lighting a gas stove properly is essential for safety, as well as efficiency. Here are some tips on how to light your gas stove safely and effectively.

First, make sure the burner is in the off position and all knobs are turned completely off. Place a match or lighter near the burner and depress the knob while continuing to hold it down. This will allow gas to flow out of the burner and be ignited by the match or lighter. Make sure you keep your face away from any open flame when lighting your stove.

Once you've lit the burner, let go of the knob and adjust it until you have reached your desired flame size. Be careful not to move it too quickly or too far, as this may lead to an uneven flame or even an accidental fire hazard. Also, be sure that all other knobs are still in their off position before you leave your stove unattended.

Finally, make sure you always turn off your burners when they're no longer in use â€“ even if it's only for a few minutes! Leaving them on can be dangerous and could lead to a fire hazard if left unattended for too long. 

With these tips in mind, lighting up your gas stove should be easy and safe! Just remember: check all knobs are off before lighting up any burners; keep your face away from any open flames; adjust only one knob at a time; and always turn off burners when they're not being used!
