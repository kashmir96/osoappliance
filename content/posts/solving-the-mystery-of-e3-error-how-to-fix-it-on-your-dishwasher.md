## Understanding the E3 Error on a Dishwasher
Having a dishwasher capable of doing the hard work of cleaning our dishes is a great convenience. Most of the time, these appliances run smoothly, but just like any other device, they can suffer problems. One common issue can be the E3 error code. If you’re struggling with this code, check out this blog to help you find out how to fix it.

An E3 error code indicates that there’s a problem with the heating element or electronic board of your dishwasher. Since different systems can affect the temperature of the washing water, this code warns you that your dishwasher isn’t able to heat up as it needs to. This means that the dishes will be left dirtier, and once this error code is shown, the dishwasher will shut down.

Luckily, there are a few steps you can take to try and fix this issue. Keep in mind that depending on how your dishwasher is set up, you might need to call in a professional electrician to fix the issue. 

The first thing you should check is the power supply. Ensure that the voltage is correctly regulated, since this can be essential for the functioning of the heating element. Also, verify whether the dishwasher power cord is receiving power and check whether the fuses are intact.

Next, you should focus on the heating element itself. Make sure that it isn’t damaged, that the connections are all tight and secure, and that nothing is blocking it.

Finally, you should have a look at the electronic board. Gently inspect it to see that it looks alright, and check the connections for any potential malfunctions.

After carefully doing all of this, you should run a test cycle to check that the error code isn’t back.

Remember, depending on the complexity of the diagnosis, you might need a qualified technical service to properly check your dishwasher and make sure it’s up and running.
