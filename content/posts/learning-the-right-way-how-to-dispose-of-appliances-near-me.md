## Properly Disposing of Appliances - The Essential Guide 

If your home is like most people, you may have a few outdated or malfunctioning appliances lying around. While repairing and recycling appliances is always the best option, sometimes disposing of them is the only solution. But how exactly do you go about disposing of appliances? 

The first thing to consider when disposing of an appliance is your local regulations. Many cities and even some states have specific laws governing how appliances must be stored, recycled or disposed, so it’s important to research your local regulations and find out what steps need to be taken. It is also highly recommended to check with your local environmental agency as they may be able to provide additional insight on rules and regulations.

In some areas, you may be able to drop off any appliances you’d like to dispose of at local recycling centers or charities. Additionally, most places are equipped to pick up appliances for a small fee. Some may even provide appliance pick up for free. 

If recycling or donating appliances isn’t an option, most appliances cannot simply go into the trash and must be disposed of properly. Depending on the particular appliance, you may have to hire a professional junk removal service, specific hazardous material disposal company or contact a local dump to properly dispose of it. Can’t find any of the previously mentioned options? Most local handymen, plumbers and electricians can often do the job for you. 

Knowing the proper way to dispose of redundant or outdated appliances is essential for homeowners and apartment-dwellers alike. Doing it right will keep your home free of clutter and avoid expensive fines or other penalties if you aren’t aware of or ignore any local regulations.

When shopping for new appliances, keep in mind that some models are designed to last longer. Investing in well-made, reliable, and energy-efficient models can result in fewer old appliances collecting dust and having to be disposed of.
