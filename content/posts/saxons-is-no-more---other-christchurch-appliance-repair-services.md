# Saxons is no more - other christchurch appliance repair services

Saxons Appliance Repair, located in Christchurch, New Zealand, was one of the longest serving appliance repair services in the area. It provided reliable service for years and had an excellent reputation in the area. Unfortunately, Saxons is no more. 

Saxons had been providing appliance repairs to local customers since 1998 and was well-known for their efficiency and dependability. The company specialized in repairing many makes and models of washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, ovens, stoves and fridges. They also offered services such as installation advice as well as servicing to keep appliances running perfectly. This made them a go-to service for many people when they needed help with their appliances. 

Unfortunately, Saxons closed its doors in 2022 due to a downturn in business. The closure of Saxons came as a shock to many customers that had come to rely on this service over the years.
