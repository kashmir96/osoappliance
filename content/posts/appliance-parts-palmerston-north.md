Welcome to the blog post about appliance parts for sale in Palmerston North! If you are looking for a new appliance part or replacement part, then you have come to the right place. At this blog post, we will discuss some of the best places to find appliance parts in Palmerston North and what types of parts they offer.

First and foremost, if you are looking for an appliance part that is not regularly stocked in regular stores, then your best bet might be online retailers like Amazon or eBay. These websites have a wide selection of both new and second-hand appliance parts at great prices. It is also worth noting that many online retailers offer free shipping on orders over a certain amount or provide discounts when purchasing multiple items. 

If you would prefer to buy your appliance parts locally, then there are several local stores that specialize in selling spare parts for appliances as well as general home maintenance items like tools and cleaning supplies. One such store is Plumber's Mate which offers a range of plumbing supplies as well as spare parts for appliances including washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators and more. They also offer installation services if needed – meaning getting your machine up and running again will be hassle free! 

Another great local store with an excellent range of spare parts is Appliance Parts & Service Centre located on Main Street in Palmerston North City Centre. The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable about all sorts of home appliances from vacuum cleaners to refrigerators – making them the perfect go-to place when it comes to finding the right part for your needs. 

Finally, there’s one more option available which can help save money while still providing quality spares – second-hand shops! The Salvation Army Thrift Store on Fitzherbert Avenue stocks preowned goods such as furniture, clothing and even electrical appliances - all at deeply discounted prices compared with buying brand new items from retail outlets. Furthermore, they also stock second-hand spares so if you need a small piece like a lid handle or something more substantial like an oven element - there’s every chance these can be found here too! 

In conclusion, finding quality appliance spares at affordable prices does not need to be difficult thanks to these stores located throughout Palmerston North city centre offering everything from brand new pieces through to used spares – helping keep costs down while ensuring reliable performance from any machine!
