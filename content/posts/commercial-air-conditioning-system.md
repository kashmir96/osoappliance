Commercial air conditioning systems are designed to provide cooling and comfort in large buildings. These systems are used in many types of businesses, including schools, hospitals, offices, and other places where a large number of people gather. Commercial air conditioning systems are typically more complex than residential units and require expert installation and maintenance.

The main components of a commercial air conditioning system include an outdoor condenser unit, an indoor evaporator unit, ductwork for distributing the cooled air throughout the building, thermostats for controlling the temperature settings, fans to move the air around, and filters to keep the air clean. The outdoor condenser unit is responsible for compressing cool refrigerant gas into liquid form before it is sent indoors through the ductwork. The liquid refrigerant then evaporates inside the indoor evaporator coil which absorbs heat from inside your building’s space before being recondensed back into a gas form outside by the condenser unit. 

The most important part of any commercial system is proper installation in order to ensure long-term performance and efficiency. This includes selecting a system that’s properly sized for your building’s needs as well as making sure all components are correctly connected together with secure seals that won’t leak any refrigerant or allow dirt particles into your system which can cause damage over time. Additionally, regular maintenance such as filter changes should be done regularly in order to keep your system running at peak efficiency levels while also minimizing energy costs associated with running it over time. 

Overall commercial air conditioning systems play an essential role in keeping our businesses comfortable while ensuring they remain energy efficient so they don’t take too much from our wallets!
