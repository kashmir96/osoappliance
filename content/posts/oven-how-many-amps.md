When it comes to home appliances, the amount of power they use is an important consideration. One of the most common questions people have is how many amps does a stove use? 

The answer depends on the type of stove you have. Most electric stoves require between 20 and 50 amps to operate properly. Gas stoves typically require less power, usually between 10 and 20 amps. The exact number will depend on the size and type of your stove. 

If you are looking to install a new stove, it is important to check with your local electrician to ensure that your homeâ€™s wiring can handle the load. It is also important to check with your local utility company to make sure that your service panel can handle the additional load. 

In addition to the amps needed for operation, you should also consider other factors such as energy efficiency, safety features, and convenience features when selecting a new stove for your home. Taking all of these into account will help you make an informed decision when it comes time to purchase a new stove for your home.
