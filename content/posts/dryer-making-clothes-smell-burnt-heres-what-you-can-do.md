## Troubleshooting That Burnt Smell From Your Dryer

If your clothes come out of the dryer smelling like something is burning, it can be both startling and concerning. Not only can it be an unpleasant smell to deal with on your laundry, it can also be a sign that something is wrong with the dryer itself. Don't panic though! There are steps you can take to figure out the issue and get your dryer running cleanly in no time. Read on to learn how to troubleshoot and address the burning smell coming from your dryer. 

The first step when diagnosing this issue is to check the dryer itself. Make sure that the lint filter is clean and free of any blockages. A clog in the filter can cause heat to back up and burn the lint, which produces that burning smell when your clothes are placed in the dryer. Alternatively, check the dryer vent itself to see if it's clogged with lint or backed up in any way. Take caution here, as the vent is usually hot when doing this. Once you're sure that the lint filter and the vent are clean and clear, you're ready to move on to the bigger picture. 

If you can still smell the smell of burning after cleaning the lint filter and the vent, you may need to inspect the drum of the dryer. Reach in and make sure that nothing is stuck onto the heating element or wedged between any of the other parts. Make sure to remove any debris, lint, or objects that were stuck and re-start the dryer to see if the burning smell returns.

Lastly, if none of the above does the trick, the issue may lie with the belt of the dryer. If it's loose, broken, or simply old and worn, it may be producing the burning smell and doing damage to the drum of the dryer itself. It's best to consult with an appliance repair technician in this case, as they are best equipped to change the belt safely and check any other components in need of repair. 

No matter the cause of the burning smell coming from your dryer, it's best to take steps to get at the root of the problem in order to keep your dryer running efficiently and your laundry smelling clean.
