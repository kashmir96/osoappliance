When it comes to washing and drying your blankets, you want to make sure that you are taking the proper steps to ensure that your blankets last for years. One of the most important steps is choosing the correct settings on your dryer. Setting the wrong temperature or time can damage your blanket, so it’s important to pay attention when drying. 

When using a dryer for a blanket, you should always use the low heat setting. High heat settings can cause shrinkage and damage to some fabrics, and since blankets come in a variety of fabrics (such as wool, cotton, polyester blends) it’s best to err on the side of caution and stick with the lowest heat setting available. 

You should also avoid over-drying your blanket by using a timer or setting an alarm on your phone. Over-drying can cause fabric fibers to break down and weaken, resulting in premature wear and tear. For best results, remove your blanket from the dryer as soon as it is done drying – or even slightly before – to avoid over-drying. 

Finally, if you want extra protection for your blanket when drying, consider using a laundry bag or pillowcase in order to prevent any tangles or snags from occurring during the process. This will help ensure that your blanket remains in top condition for years to come!
