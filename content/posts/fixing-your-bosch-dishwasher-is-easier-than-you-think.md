## Easy Fixes for Your Bosch Dishwasher
Living without a dishwasher can be a nightmare. The process of scrubbing and soaking all your dishes can be tedious and time consuming. So it can be heartbreaking when your Bosch dishwasher has an issue and stops working correctly.

However, you don't need to fear. In some cases, the issue can be an easy fix. Common sightings of these issues are humming noises, standing water, and machines that won't start.

To fix a humming noise, the issue is typically a clog. Check for a larger part, such as a spoon or fork, that may have made its way down to the dishwasher drain. If found, remove the appliance, and clear out the built-up material in the hose.

If you have standing water, then likely your water line is clogged. Unstrap the hoses and check if they’re curved or kinked. If so, straighten them out, but ensure that it’s turned off before attempting this fix. You should also try to clean out the filter too.

Lastly, if it isn't starting at all, check your circuit breakers, or switches, first. It’s possible your breaker has been tripped up, which can be rectified by simply flipping it back. Then, make sure the door latch is closed properly. If you’re still having difficulty, the issue may be a more complex problem requiring the help of an appliance repair technician.

Though fixing your Bosch dishwasher can seem daunting, there are quick and painless repairs you can try before calling in support. At the very least, you’ll feel prepared and in the know before speaking with a technician if the job is more complicated than you can manage.
