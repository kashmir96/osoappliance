## Broken Air Conditioners and their Visual Impact
No matter how careful we are with our air conditioning unit, the inevitable occurs: cracks, scrapes, and tears. When this happens, the appeal of the air conditioner and its general aesthetic, deteriorates quickly. Let's take a look at what damaged, cracked and distressed air conditioners look like and how to keep your unit looking its best.

The appearance of an air conditioner can vary from room to room. Even though some air conditioners may be made from the same materials, each one may succumb to weathering differently. An excellent example of this is the corrosion of aluminum siding. In the absence of regular maintenance, the aluminum will eventually corrode and paint will begin to peel away. The result is an air conditioning unit that looks aged and worn.

The other type of damage that can occur with air conditioning units is cracking. Cracks can be caused by direct sun exposure or an improper fit of the mounting brackets. Once the unit is installed, these cracks can worsen over time, leading to an increasingly deteriorating state. The result is a damaged air conditioner that appears to be on its last legs.

Finally, tears and scrapes often occur in air conditioning units due to hazardous materials or sharp objects. When metal is bent or punctured, the unitâ€™s design is compromised and these tears can lead to a less than ideal appearance.

It's important to keep your air conditioning unit looking its best, however it can be difficult to maintain. Luckily, there are experienced professionals that can help bring your air conditioner back to its original state.
