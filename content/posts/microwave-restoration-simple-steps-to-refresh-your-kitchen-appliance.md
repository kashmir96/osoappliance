## Microwave Restoration FAQ

1. What should I do to restore my microwave?

Restoring your microwave requires proper cleaning, deodorizing, and maintenance. To get started, remove any food residue or buildup with a damp cloth. Make sure to use a liquid dish soap with warm water to break down any grease or grime. Wipe the interior and outside with a microfiber cloth. You can also add a few drops of essential oils to the damp cloth for a fresh scent. 

2. How can I clean the inside of my microwave?

Making a DIY cleaning solution is a great way to get rid of pesky grime and stains from the inside of the microwave. Simply mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a microwave-safe bowl and heat for about five minutes. The steam will loosen up any gunk, so you can simply wipe it away with a cloth. 

3. How often should I clean my microwave?

It’s recommended that you clean your microwave on a regular basis, preferably once a week. This way, you can keep it in like-new condition and prevent any build-up or odors.

One way to remove strong smells and odors from your microwave is to use lemon juice. Mix equal parts lemon juice and water and heat the mixture in your microwave for 1-2 minutes. The lemon juice will absorb the odors, leaving your microwave smelling fresher. 

5. What other steps should I take to restore my microwave?

It’s important to not just keep your microwave clean but to also maintain it. Once the microwave is clean, you should make sure to inspect it for any loose parts or worn out elements.
