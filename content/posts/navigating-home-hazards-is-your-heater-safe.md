## Navigating Winter Home Safety: Keep Your Heater Working Safely

The winter season can bring extreme weather and freezing temperatures. For homeowners, home safety is a primary concern, particularly with regard to heating systems. Is your heater safe for use? Read on for tips to help ensure you and your family are safe from home heating hazards.

When it comes to safely using your home heating system, there are several steps you should take. Take the time to inspect your home's heating equipment. Look for any damages or hazardous conditions by checking for frayed wires or casing damage. If you see anything that worries you, turn off your heating appliance and contact a certified technician for repairs.

Check for combustible materials that may be too close to the heating equipment. Keep all combustible materials, such as paper, fabric, carpet, boxes, and other materials, at least three feet away from any heating appliance.

You should also check to make sure your home has working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors as well as an emergency evacuation plan. Carbon monoxide is a silent killer, so it is important to make sure your home is equipped with working detectors to warn when levels are dangerous.

Another important safety step is scheduling annual maintenance for your heating equipment. This will help keep it in good working condition and reduce the risk of a breakdown. Servicing by a certified technician should include verifying proper operation, flue inspections, and pilot light and thermocouple checking. 

To ensure that your furnace or heater is running properly and safely, follow these tips. You can also keep your whole family safe by knowing the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and having an emergency response plan prepared and in place ahead of time. 

Having a certified repair technician check the safety of your home's heating equipment during the cold season is an important step for homeowners.
