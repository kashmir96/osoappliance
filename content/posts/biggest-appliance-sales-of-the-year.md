It's no secret that the holidays are one of the best times of year to take advantage of some great deals on major appliances. Supermarkets, department stores, and online retailers all offer discounts during the holiday season, so it pays to shop around. But if you're looking for the biggest appliance sales of the year, there's no better time than Black Friday and Cyber Monday. 

Black Friday is a day after Thanksgiving in which retailers traditionally slash prices on items to get shoppers into their stores for an early start on Christmas shopping. It's become an annual tradition for many shoppers who look forward to taking advantage of these deep discounts. This year, Black Friday falls on November 27th and will mark some of the biggest savings available all year round. 

Cyber Monday follows shortly after Black Friday a few days later on November 30th this year and has become another major shopping event in recent years. On this day, online retailers offer deep discounts that can be even bigger than those offered in-store during Black Friday sales events! 

No matter which way you go about it - going out or staying home - you're sure to find great deals this holiday season when it comes to buying appliances like refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines and more! Whether you need a new appliance or want to upgrade your current one at a discounted price, now is definitely the time to do so as both brick-and-mortar stores as well as online retailers offer unbeatable savings during this period every single year.
