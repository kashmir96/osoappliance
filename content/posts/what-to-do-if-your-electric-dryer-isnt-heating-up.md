## Diagnosing and Troubleshooting an Electric Dryer That's Not Heating

If your electric dryer is running but not heating, it's only natural that you'll want to get it fixed as soon as possible. While a properly working electric dryer is a must-have appliance for many households, a malfunctioning one is a huge hassle. Luckily, many home owners can take on the issue themselves to save time and money.

There are many reasons why an electric dryer may not be heating up. Before jumping into any expensive repairs, begin with the simplest fixes first - such as cleaning the lint trap and checking the exhaust hose. If the dryer isn't heating up after cleaning the lint trap and exhuast hose, the next step is to take a look at the dryer's heating element. If the heating element is no longer working, it may need to be replaced. Depending on the model of your dryer, this will involve either removing the rear panel or accessing the heating element from the sides.

In addition to the heating element, the cause of a non-heating dryer may be thermostat, thermal fuse or timer problems. The thermostat keeps the temperature at the optimum level for clothes to dry and regulates the current to the heating element. The thermal fuse acts as a safety to shut off the current and avoid further damage if the temperature inside the dryer should become too hot. The timer helps to control the length of the drying cycle, but it does not control the heating element.

It's important to properly diagnose the cause of the problem before jumping into repairs. If you're unsure of the exact cause or don't feel comfortable taking on the repair yourself, it's best to call in a professional.
