If you’re looking to save money on a new appliance, timing your purchase is key. The best time of year for appliance sales is generally during the fall and winter months. Not only are there usually more discounts available, but manufacturers will also be releasing their newest models around this time. This can make it easier to find the perfect appliance at a great price. 

One of the best times to shop for appliances is during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. Many stores offer deep discounts on these days that can save you hundreds of dollars on your purchase. And since Black Friday falls right after Thanksgiving, many companies will have special holiday promotions that can really sweeten the deal. 

The month of September also typically has some good deals on appliances as well. This is when most manufacturers roll out their new models, so retailers will often offer discounts or freebies in order to clear out old inventory and make room for the new models coming in December or January. You may even be able to snag an older model at a fraction of the cost if you look around enough! 

Finally, don’t forget about end-of-season sales in June and July. These are often one of the best times to buy appliances as many stores want to get rid of their excess inventory before summer vacationers start shopping for summer items like air conditioners and pool toys! 

Overall, if you’re looking for a good deal on an appliance, try to shop during one of these three times: Black Friday/Cyber Monday in November/December; September; or June/July end-of-season sales events!
