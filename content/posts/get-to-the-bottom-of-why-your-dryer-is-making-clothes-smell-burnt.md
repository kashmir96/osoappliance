## Uncover Reasons for Burnt Smells in Your Dryer
Do you smell something burning when your dryer is running? It's not a pleasant smell and it could be a sign of a serious problem with your dryer. Uncovering the source of the smell and fix it is essential to stay safe and keep your dryer in good condition. 

The burning smell that originates from a clothes dryer is often due to lint build-up. Lint is composed of tiny fibers from cloths such as towels and clothing that are released in the drying process. Over time, lint builds up and restricts air flow to your dryer's heating element. If too much lint builds up, the air flow is reduced further, causing the heating element to overheat. The overheating of the element causes the smell that is often described as a burning rubber smell. 

If you suspect the smell you smell is due to lint build-up, you can remedy this by cleaning the lint screen after each load of laundry. The screen should be cleaned with a soft brush. Additionally, inspect the dryer vent outside of your home. Make sure all the connections and joints are secure and there is no damage or blockages. 

A second potential cause of a burning smell can be a bad thermal fuse. The fuse acts as a failsafe and turns off the heat if the dryer excessively heats. Over time, the thermal fuse can fail and break, allowing heat to continue to be produced without interruption and cause the burning smell. To diagnose if the thermal fuse is bad, a professional should be called.

If your dryer is emitting a burning smell, take the necessary steps to prevent potential fire hazards and protect your home and family. Clean lint screens and inspect for vent blockages and damage. If that has no affect, or the smell persists, call a professional and have them diagnose and repair the appliance.
