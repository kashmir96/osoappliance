A washer dryer combo is a single appliance that combines a washing machine and a clothes dryer. It is an all-in-one solution for laundry needs, saving both space and time. The cost of a washer dryer combo can vary depending on the size, features, and brand. 

Small washer dryer combos typically cost between $800 and $1,500. These units are usually between 1.5 and 2.5 cubic feet, making them ideal for apartments or smaller households. They are also portable and can easily be moved from one place to another. 

Mid-sized washer dryer combos typically cost between $1,500 and $2,500. These units are usually between 3 and 4 cubic feet in size, making them suitable for larger households or those with more laundry needs. They also tend to have more advanced features than smaller models such as multiple wash cycles, temperature settings, and steam options. 

Large washer dryer combos typically cost between $2,500 and $3,000 or more depending on the brand and features. These units are usually over 4 cubic feet in size and can handle large loads of laundry with ease. They also tend to have the most advanced features such as steam cleaning, sanitizing cycles, delay start options, and energy efficiency ratings. 

Overall, the cost of a washer dryer combo depends on the size, features, and brand you choose. Small models may be more affordable but may not have all the features you need while larger models may be more expensive but will give you more options to choose from.
