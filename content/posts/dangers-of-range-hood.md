If you are a homeowner and have enjoyed cooking in your kitchen for some time, you may have noticed that a range hood is an important addition to any kitchen, as they help to keep the air clean when cooking. Range hoods work by capturing smoke, grease, and other airborne particles before they can spread throughout your home. While they are an incredibly valuable addition to any kitchen, there are some dangers associated with range hoods that homeowners should be aware of. 

The first danger associated with range hoods is fire safety. If the exhaust fan of the range hood isnâ€™t properly ventilated or installed correctly, heated air and grease particles can build up inside the ductwork and cause a fire hazard. To avoid this risk it is essential for homeowners to ensure that their exhaust fan is properly vented outside of their home and regularly inspected for any signs of damage or clogged filters. 

In addition to fire hazards, there is also another potential danger associated with range hoods - carbon monoxide poisoning. While most modern models are designed with built-in carbon monoxide detectors, these detectors cannot detect small amounts of carbon monoxide build-up over time resulting from the incomplete combustion of gas stoves or other appliances connected to the same vents as the range hood. To avoid this risk homeowners should make sure that their exhaust fans are regularly cleaned and inspected for proper ventilation and have regular professional inspections done on their gas stove units to ensure no dangerous levels of carbon monoxide buildup over time. 

These risks can easily be avoided by taking some simple steps such as regularly cleaning out your filter, having it professionally inspected every so often, ensuring proper ventilation outside your home, and installing a carbon monoxide detector in close proximity to your stove unit if it does not already have one built-in. Taking these precautions will help keep you safe while enjoying all aspects of cooking in your kitchen!
