If your dryer isn't starting, it can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to try and get it working again. Here are some common causes of a dryer not starting and some tips on how to fix them.

1. Check the Power Source: The first thing you should do is make sure the dryer is plugged in and the circuit breaker hasn't been tripped. If the power source is working, then move on to the next step.

2. Check the Door Switch: If the door switch is not working properly, then the dryer will not start. To check the door switch, open the door and press the switch with your finger. If it doesn't click, then it may need to be replaced.

3. Check the Thermal Fuse: The thermal fuse is a safety device that shuts off the dryer if it gets too hot. If the thermal fuse has blown, then the dryer won't start. To check the thermal fuse, remove the back panel and check for any visible damage. If the fuse looks okay, then replace it.

4. Check the Timer: The timer controls when the dryer turns on and off. If the timer is not working properly, then the dryer won't start. To check the timer, remove the control panel and inspect the timer for any visible damage. If the timer looks okay, then replace it.

These are some of the most common causes of a dryer not starting. If you've checked all of these and the dryer still won't start, then it may be time to call a professional for help.
