When it comes to convenience, few kitchen appliances can beat the microwave. From quick and easy snacks to full meals, the microwave is an invaluable tool for busy people who need something fast and tasty. But what are the most popular microwave foods? Let's take a look!

1. Popcorn: One of the most popular microwave foods is popcorn. It’s quick, it’s easy, and it’s tasty – what more could you want? All you need is a bag of popcorn kernels and some oil (or butter if you prefer), and in minutes your favorite snack will be ready!

2. Macaroni & Cheese: Another great microwavable food is macaroni & cheese. This classic comfort food can be made in no time with just a few ingredients – like butter, milk, cheese, and of course macaroni noodles! Plus it tastes amazing warm or cold – making for an excellent lunchbox option too. 

3. Pizza: Who doesn't love pizza? And thanks to the microwave oven, you don't have to wait hours for one either! Just pop your favorite frozen pizza in there for a few minutes (check package directions) and voilà – dinner is served! 

4. Burritos: Burritos are another great microwavable meal that can be ready in no time at all! Just heat up your favorite store-bought burrito or wrap some seasoned ground beef into a tortilla with some cheese and salsa then pop it into the microwave until everything is hot and bubbly – perfecto! 

 5. Soup: Last but not least on our list of popular microwavable foods are soups – from canned varieties like Campbell's Chunky Soup to homemade creations like creamy tomato soup or hearty vegetable soup - these liquid meals always hit the spot when heated up quickly in the microwave oven - especially on those cold winter days when all you want to do is curl up with something warm to eat!
