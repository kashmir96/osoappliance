## How to Clear Bosch Washing Machine Error Codes

Bosch washing machines are known for their reliability, quality, and performance. However, even these top-of-the-line appliances can have an occasional error code. Some of the most common error codes found on Bosch washing machines are E02, E04, E06, E11, and E45.

In order to clear the error code on your Bosch washing machine, the first step is to turn off the power at the outlet or fuse box. Once the power has been disconnected, you can open the washing machine's control panel and locate the Error Reset button. This will usually be found behind the control panel or on the bottom left side of the machine.

Once the Error Reset button has been located, press and hold it for 5 to 10 seconds or until the error code lights begin to flash.

Once the error codes are cleared, it is important to properly diagnose the cause of the error code, as clearing it without addressing the underlying issue may lead to the same error code resurfacing. In most instances, where minor issues are causing the error code to display, simply running a cycle again may clear the error. 

If the error persists, you should contact a professional to help diagnose and repair any underlying problems. 

By following the steps above, you can easily clear the error codes found on your Bosch washing machine. If you need additional help in understanding the error code or the necessary repairs, be sure to check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to learn more.
