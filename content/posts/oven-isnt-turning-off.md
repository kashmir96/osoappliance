If your oven isn’t turning off, it can be a worrying issue. Not only could this be a safety hazard, but it can also cause your electricity bills to skyrocket. Luckily, there are some simple steps you can take to try and fix the issue. 

First of all, check the power cord is plugged in properly and that the socket is working. If this isn’t the issue, then you should check the circuit breaker to make sure nothing has tripped it. If nothing has tripped it, then you should reset it anyway as this could be the cause of your problem. 

Next, check that the clock or timer hasn’t been set incorrectly. This could mean that the oven will keep running until manually switched off or until the timer runs out. If this is the case then simply adjust the settings on your oven and switch it off manually. 

It is also important to check that none of your oven’s buttons are stuck down or malfunctioning. This could be causing your oven to stay on even after you have switched it off manually. If this is the case then you should contact an engineer for repairs as soon as possible. 

Finally, if none of these solutions have worked then there may be an issue with your oven’s thermostat or heating element. This could be causing your oven to overheat and not turn off when it should do so. In this instance you should contact an engineer for repairs as soon as possible in order to prevent any further damage or safety hazards from occurring. 

By following these steps you should hopefully have fixed any issues with your oven not turning off properly and can now enjoy using it safely again!
