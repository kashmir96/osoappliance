Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular as people become more aware of the quality of air in their homes. With so many features and models on the market, it can be difficult to know which features are most important when it comes to selecting an air purifier. To make your decision easier, here are the top 10 features you should look for in an air purifier: 

1. HEPA filter – The HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filter is the gold standard when it comes to filtering out pollutants in your home’s air. It is capable of removing 99.97% of all particles 0.3 microns or larger in size, including dust mites, pet dander, mold spores, pollen and other allergens. 

2. Carbon filter – A carbon filter helps eliminate odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by trapping them within its activated carbon granules or chemical bed media. This can help improve indoor air quality by reducing the levels of airborne chemicals and odors caused by things like paint fumes or cigarette smoke. 

3 .Ozone generator – While some ozone generators can be used to help purify indoor air, many experts advise against using them due to potential health risks associated with ozone exposure at high levels. If you do choose a model that includes an ozone generator, make sure that you set it only at low levels and keep it away from any occupied areas of your home for safety reasons. 

4 .UV light – Ultraviolet (UV) light technology uses short-wavelength UV radiation to kill airborne bacteria and viruses as they pass through the unit's internal fan blades or filters before being released back into your home’s atmosphere cleanly and safely without producing any harmful ozone emissions like some other methods do . UV lights also have the added benefit of helping reduce odors caused by these microorganisms as well if they have been left unchecked for too long in a room without proper ventilation. 

 5 .Ionizer – An ionizer works alongside other filtration systems by releasing negative ions into your indoor environment which helps attract airborne particles onto surfaces such as walls or furniture where they can then be easily vacuumed away without releasing them back into circulation again inside your home's breathing space . This feature is especially beneficial for people who suffer from allergies because these ions help capture even small particles such as dust mites that may otherwise go unnoticed through traditional filtration methods alone .

 6 . Fan speed control– Many air purifiers come with adjustable fan speeds so that you have control over how much air passes through their internal filters each hour depending on how quickly you need clean air circulating throughout your living space at any given time . Adjustable fan speeds also allow users to customize their unit's noise output level , making sure that it runs quietly enough not to disturb anyone while still effectively doing its job correctly !

 7 . Room coverage area– Room coverage area is important when choosing an air purifier because larger rooms require a more powerful unit with a higher Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) rating than smaller ones do in order for them both effectively remove airborne pollutants from all corners equally well over time . Make sure that whatever model you purchase has enough power within its motor capacity range stated on its product page specs sheet listed online before purchasing ! 

 8 . Energy efficiency– Most modern units come with energy efficient labeling , meaning they use less electricity than older models did while still providing good performance standards overall when needing clean fresh breathable oxygenated living spaces inside homes & commercial buildings alike ! 

 9 Auto mode & timer settings– Many high end models include not only auto mode & timer settings but also have built-in sensors which detect changes in particle concentrations inside rooms - allowing users adjust their settings accordingly whenever needed if sudden spikes occur during certain times throughout day/night cycles too! 

 10 Replacement parts availability– Last but not least , check what kind replacement parts are available online before buying one - having access spare cartridges & filters makes cleaning maintenance much easier since regular upkeep necessary prolong life expectancy device itself while maintaining optimal efficiency ratings! 

Overall, these are the top 10 features you should look for when selecting an air purifier. Remember to keep in mind factors such as size and power requirements, as well as replacement parts availability and energy efficiency when making your decision. With the right information, you can find the perfect air purifier for your home’s needs!
