## How to Diagnose and Repair an FA Error Code on Your Washing Machine

When an appliance stops working suddenly, it’s never a pleasant experience. This is especially if you encounter an error code like FA while attempting to complete a load of laundry. To save time and money, here’s some tips to help you troubleshoot and repair the FA error code on your washing machine.

**Understanding the FA Code**

The FA error code is usually associated with a draining issue. Your washing machine’s pump isn't able to drain the water from the appliance because it's either blocked, restricted, or malfunctioning. It's important to note that different types of washing machines will experience the FA error differently. As such, the troubleshooting process may vary from washer to washer.

**Troubleshooting Tips**

If your washing machine is displaying the FA error code, then it may indicate that there is something impeding the pump from draining the water. To resolve this issue, you will need to locate and remove any obstructions that may be stopping the water from running into the pump. If your washing machine has an impeller, check it for any foreign objects that may be blocking it. 
 
You can also try resetting the appliance by unplugging it and plugging it back in after a few minutes have passed. This will likely reset the error code and if not, then you may need to check the pump to assess whether it is functioning properly. If the pump is damaged, then it will need to be replaced.

**Conclusion**

Fixing an FA error code on your washing machine can be a daunting task, especially if you're unfamiliar with the appliance. If you don't feel comfortable troubleshooting the issue, it always best to call in a professional appliance repair technician.
