## Uncovering the Most Common Microwave Problems

Microwaves are a staple of most modern homes and kitchens, making it easier to cook everything from frozen dinners to popcorn. Unfortunately, microwaves break down from time to time. We have compiled the most common microwave problems and their fixes, to help get your much-loved kitchen appliance back up and running again.

When microwaves fail to turn on, the most common cause is a faulty door latch. The door latch must be fully and securely closed for the microwave to work, so it’s possible that one of the switches in the latch system has malfunctioned. To check, simply push the door latch with your hand to see if it will engage. If the door still won’t fully close, then inspect the two switches that are responsible for the door latch security system.

Another common microwave problem is burning food. This usually happens when microwave power decreases over time, causing food to take longer to cook and burn. If this occurs, verify that the door latch is ín working order and that the microwave cavity is free of any food residue. If all looks good, then you may need to replace either the magnetron or the diode. 

Finally, if your microwave is making an unusual noise, it is likely caused by loose fan blades or damaged belts. To check this, access the fan and inspect the blades, making sure they are connected securely to the fan axle. If they are and the noise persists, you may need to replace the belt of the fan motor.

Microwaves are complex pieces of machinery and fixing them can be challenging. However, by understanding and diagnosing the most common microwave problems, you can save yourself time and money by quickly troubleshooting and finding the right repair solution for your appliance.
