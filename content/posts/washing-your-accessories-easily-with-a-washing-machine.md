## Easily Clean Your Accessories in a Washing Machine

Having a washing machine makes your life easier. Not only can you wash your clothes, but you can also use it to clean your accessories such as scarves, hats and gloves. While there are some items which should be hand washed, most can be easily and quickly cleaned in a washing machine with a few key pieces of information in mind.

Before you start, it’s important to check the labels on your items. Avoid using the washing machine on items labelled ‘dry clean only’ or with special instructions as these items may shrink, change colour or otherwise be damaged if put in a washing machine.

Next, make sure that when washing delicate items such as scarves, gloves or clothes with beading or sequins, put them in a mesh laundry bag or pillow case to prevent damage to the fabric or trims. If possible, it’s best to wash delicate items separately from other laundry.

When you’ve chosen a washing program, use a mild detergent and a low temperature. For added protection, there are specific detergents for delicate fabrics which will help further protect your items of clothing and accessories.

Weatherproof items such as hats and gloves should also go in the washing machine. Avoid any extreme temperatures and abrasive detergents and then leave to dry naturally.

Afterwards, to help keep your accessories looking their best, it’s best to iron and press them afterwards, or use a hand steamer. This will help to maintain item shape and texture and help to lift the pile.

By following the tips above, it’s easy to quickly and easily clean accessories in your washing machine without causing shrinkage, discoloration, fading or damage to the fabric.
