If you have ever experienced your oven making noise even after it is turned off, you know how unsettling it can be. Not only is the noise annoying, but it can also be a sign of a potential problem with your appliance. To help you better understand what might be causing the noises, and how to potentially fix them yourself before calling an appliance repair service person from our directory list here are some things to consider:

1. Check Your Oven Settings - First and foremost, make sure that your oven settings are correct and not creating any unnecessary noise. This could simply mean checking that the timer is off or that the fan has been switched off. If these settings were accidentally left on, this could be causing the unwanted noises in your oven. 

2. Clean Out Any Bits of Food - If there are any bits of food stuck inside or around your oven’s heating element, this could create a loud buzzing sound when turned on or off. Make sure to clean out any food particles so as not to interfere with its operation or create excessive noise when running and turning off. 

3. Inspect for Loose Parts - Another potential cause for loud noises coming from within your oven can be due to loose parts rattling against each other when heated up or cooling down after being turned off. Carefully inspect all parts of the oven (especially near where heat is generated) for anything rattling around that shouldn’t be there as this could easily explain why you're hearing such loud noises coming from within it even after being shut off! 

4. Check Your Oven Door Gasket - Lastly, make sure to check if there are any damages along the edge of either side of your oven door gasket as these too can cause excess vibrations which in turn will lead to an unpleasant humming sound even after being shut down completely! 

Hopefully one of these tips gave you some insight into why your oven may be making strange noises even when it’s turned off and provided you with some troubleshooting methods which may help in fixing it without having to call an appliance repair service person from our directory list .
