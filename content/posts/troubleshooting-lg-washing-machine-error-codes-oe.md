## Troubleshooting LG Washing Machine OE Error Codes
There are a wide variety of error codes that can appear on your LG washing machine. One of the most common is the OE error, which can occur for a number of reasons. It's important to understand what the code means before attempting to troubleshoot and fix the problem.

The "OE" error code stands for "overflows error" and can be caused by a number of issues. The most common reason is a clogged drain, which prevents the machine from draining properly. This can occur when there's a buildup of lint or other debris in the filter. It can also occur if the drain hose is blocked or bent.

In order to fix the problem, you should start by examining the filter, drain hose, and drain pipe for blockages. If you find one, remove it and try running a cycle again. If the issue persists, you may need to contact a professional for assistance.

It's also important to note that the OE error code can also indicate problems with the machine's water supply. This can occur if there's poor water pressure or if the water inlet valve is not functioning properly. You should check these parts of the machine before attempting any other fixes.
