## What Time Do Laundromats Close: A Guide to Laundry Hours
If you’re looking for a public laundry facility, you’ll likely find it at your local laundromat. Whether it's near your home or your college campus, laundromats provide an affordable place to do your laundry when you don't have access to a washer and dryer. But what time do they close? 

The exact operating hours of any given laundromat may vary from location to location, so be sure to check with the staff before making any assumptions. In general, most large chain locations are open seven days a week for extended hours — usually from 8am-10pm on weekdays and 8am-8pm on weekends. That said, smaller independent stores may have shorter hours or even close during the afternoon between lunchtime and late afternoon or evening shifts. 

In addition to regular day-to-day business hours, many laundromats also offer special deals that might include extended evening or weekend hours. These deals may be advertised on their website or social media accounts so be sure to stay up-to-date with the latest offerings! 

When using a public laundry facility like a laundromat, it's important to take care of both the machines and clothing being washed as damage can occur if either is not handled properly - especially if you're using an older machine that's seen some wear over time!
