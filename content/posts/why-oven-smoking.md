If you're asking why your oven is smoking, the answer can depend on a few different things. 

The most common cause of oven smoke is due to food residue being burned off during the pre-heating process. This is perfectly normal and will usually stop after a few minutes once the oven has reached the desired temperature. 

Another possible cause of smoke could be due to grease or oil dripping onto the heating elements underneath the oven. This can happen if you are cooking something that has a lot of fat or oil in it, such as bacon or fried chicken. If this is what's causing your smoke, you should clean up any excess grease or oil from around and underneath your oven before attempting to use it again. 

If you recently cleaned your oven and it's now smoking, the cleaning chemicals you used may be the cause. If this is the case, you should turn off your oven and allow it to cool before attempting to use it again. Additionally, you may want to avoid using harsh chemicals in the future as they can damage your oven and cause unnecessary smoke.

Finally, your oven may be smoking due to a faulty heating element. If this is the case, you should contact a professional for help in repairing or replacing the element before attempting to use your oven again. 

No matter what the cause of your oven smoke may be, it's important to take precautions and properly address any issues before using it again. Doing so will help keep you and your family safe from potential hazards associated with a malfunctioning appliance.
