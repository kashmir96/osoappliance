Are you in the market for a new washer and dryer? If so, you’re probably wondering when is the best time to buy. The answer depends on several factors such as budget, brand preference, and availability. Generally speaking, the best time to buy washers and dryers is during sales periods such as holiday weekends or Cyber Monday. 

Retailers usually offer sales around major holidays like Memorial Day or Black Friday. During these times, stores will often offer deep discounts on washers and dryers from top brands like LG or Samsung. Additionally, shoppers can also save money by looking for bundle deals that include both a washer and dryer at once. 

Another great time to purchase new laundry appliances is during Cyber Monday. This online shopping event typically falls on the Monday after Thanksgiving each year and offers some of the lowest prices of the season. Online retailers like Amazon often have exclusive deals on washers and dryers that are only available for this one day sale. 

Finally, shoppers may also want to consider buying their new laundry appliances in January after the holidays have passed. Many stores offer clearance items at this time of year as they make room for new models arriving in February or March. 

No matter when you decide to buy a new washer and dryer, it’s important to compare prices from different retailers before making your purchase. Doing research ahead of time can help ensure you get the best deal possible on your next set of laundry appliances!
