## Uncovering the Meaning of 'err' in Coding

Do you commonly see the error code ‘err’ when using or troubleshooting household appliances? If so, you are probably familiar with the frustration that comes with trying to figure out what this cryptic code actually means. 

When first introduced to coding, many people find the mix of numbers and letters incredibly confusing. Although 'err' looks like a simple form of shorthand, it is actually an invaluable tool that can help you to understand what could be causing an issue with a household appliance.

In coding, err is short for error. It is used to indicate that something has gone wrong, and is sending a signal to alert you to this fact. Technicians are able to look at the ‘err’ on an appliance’s display and use it to determine what action needs to be taken. It can tell the technician whether a problem could be the result of a hardware or software issue and what steps need to be taken to fix it.

If you are ever presented with an ‘err’ code when using your appliance, it is important to take note of what the code is and then contact a technician in order to get a proper diagnosis of the issue. Making use of a tool such as our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) can be incredibly helpful in providing more detailed information about the code.

The next time you see an ‘err’ code, don’t panic. Instead, take a few moments to write down the code and contact a qualified technician to help you identify what is causing the issue. Investing the time and effort to properly diagnose the cause of the problem will often be well worth your while in the long run.
