## Making an Oven Knob Reparation Easier
An oven knob shaft can get broken due to accidents or wear and tear. If the shaft breaks, it can be difficult to repair it on your own. Here we provide tips that can make the repair process easier.

When a knob shaft gets broken, it needs to be replaced. Replacement knobs are usually sold at home improvement stores or online. Before purchasing, you will need to check the model number on your existing knob and get one that is the same size and design.

You will also need a screwdriver. Now unscrew the knob from its base using the screwdriver. At times, the shafts may get jammed which makes it difficult for you to unscrew them; in such cases, a vice or a wrench can be used to loosen the knob.

Once you have taken off the knob, inspect the flat metal part that is underneath. Carefully detach the 0-ring gasket before replacing it with the new part. To make the gasket easier to remove, you can use a butter knife or a similar slim instrument.

Before attaching the new knob, make sure that the new 0-ring is in its right place. Tighten only until the knob is firmly secured. Over-tightening can cause damage to the parts.

The best way to make sure that your oven knob shaft repair is done correctly is to hire a professional appliance repair technician. Not only will they have the right tools to make the process easier, but they will also be able to identify other potential problems that may need attention.
