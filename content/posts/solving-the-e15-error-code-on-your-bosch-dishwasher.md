## Identifying and Resolving a Bosch Dishwasher E15 Error

Regular maintenance and troubleshooting can help to ensure your Bosch dishwasher is working reliably and efficiently. Luckily, Bosch dishwashers provide error codes to explain the underlying issues when your dishwasher is not performing properly. One of the more common error codes displayed on the Bosch dishwasher is the E15 error code. This guide will explore what the E15 error code is, explain likely causes and possible solutions guide to help you quickly get your Bosch dishwasher back up and running.

### What is the E15 Error Code?

The E15 error code on your Bosch dishwasher indicates a water heating issue. When your dishwasher does not receive adequate hot water for its operation, you are likely to see an E15 error code displayed. Your Bosch dishwasher could require additional troubleshooting to determine what is causing the inadequate water heating.

### Potential Causes for the E15 Error

When your Bosch dishwasher displays the E15 error code, it is often the result of a few potential causes. One of the most common causes of the E15 error code is clogged filters. The filters inside your Bosch dishwasher become clogged over time and can reduce water flow by preventing water from entering the dishwasher. This can happen when there is too much build-up inside your filters, so it is important to clean the filters regularly to prevent errors like the E15.

In addition to clogged filters, a kinked supply hose or inadequate water temperature can also result in the E15 error code being displayed. A kinked hose can effectively reduce the amount of water coming from the supply line and cause your dishwasher to not receive enough water. Similarly, a water heater set below 120째F (49째C) can also be the cause of inadequate water heating, resulting in the E15 error code. 

### Resolving the E15 Error 

To resolve the E15 error code, you will need to inspect your Bosch dishwasher to address the underlying cause. Cleaning the filters will often get rid of issues like the E15 error code, so this should be looked into first.

If the clogged filters do not address the issue, check the supply hose to make sure it is not kinked and affecting the water flow. You should also check the temperature of your water heater and make sure it is set to at least 120째F. Once any of the above potential causes of the E15 error code have been addressed, you should see the error code clear from the display. 

Should the E15 error code not disappear after you have addressed the potential causes, you may need to consult with an appliance repair technician to inspect and repair your Bosch dishwasher.
