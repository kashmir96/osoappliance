Have you ever wondered how your dryer works? Whether you’re using a standard clothes dryer or a combination washer/dryer, the process of drying your clothes is actually quite simple.

In a standard dryer, the drum is heated by an electric heating element. This heat circulates air and moisture in the machine, which helps to evaporate moisture from wet clothes. This heated air then passes into the outer walls of the drum and exits through vents near the back or bottom of the machine. A fan helps to remove even more moisture from your clothes by blowing out this hot air and pushing it through an exhaust vent outside your home. 

A lint filter catches any debris like lint and hair that may have been picked up during washing as well as fibers that are released from clothing during drying. The lint should be cleaned before each use for best results. 

The temperature setting on your dryer allows you to set how hot or cold you want it to be for different types of fabrics. In addition, many machines offer additional drying settings such as “Low Heat” and “Delicate” which are designed for delicate fabrics like silk and wool that would be ruined with too much heat or agitation in traditional settings. 

The timer control sets how long your machine will run until it automatically shuts off when finished so that you don't have to worry about leaving wet laundry in too long or not long enough! 

By understanding these basic components, you can ensure that your laundry comes out just right every time!
