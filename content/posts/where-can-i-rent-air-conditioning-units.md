When the temperatures rise in the summer, it can be difficult to beat the heat without air conditioning. Fortunately, you don’t have to purchase an air conditioning unit; you can rent one instead. Here’s where you can find a place to rent an air conditioner:

1. Home Improvement Stores - Home improvement stores like Lowe's and Home Depot often carry a wide variety of air conditioners for rent. You can find window units, portable ACs, and even whole house systems at these stores. Be sure to call ahead to make sure they have what you need in stock.

2. Rental Companies - There are companies that specialize in equipment rentals, including air conditioners. These companies usually carry all types of AC units that range from small window units to large central systems with multiple cooling zones. Prices vary depending on the size and type of unit you need and may be higher than those found at home improvement stores since these companies cater specifically to contractors and other businesses that require heavy-duty units for long-term use or large jobsites. 

3 . Online Retailers - If you don’t want to leave your home, there are also online retailers who offer AC rentals as well as sales. These retailers usually have a wide variety of models available and their prices may be lower than those found at rental companies or home improvement stores since they typically order their units directly from manufacturers or distributors. 

No matter where you decide to rent an air conditioner from, make sure that it is properly installed by a professional before operating it so that it works efficiently and safely within your home or business environment.
