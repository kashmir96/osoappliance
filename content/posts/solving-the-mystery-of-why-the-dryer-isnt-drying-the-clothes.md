## Why Isn't the Dryer Drying the Clothes?
Taking care of laundry can be a challenge, but when appliances don't work, it can be frustrating. If your clothes don't seem to be drying in the dryer, there are a few things you can do to diagnose and potentially solve the issue.

First, check to make sure the dryer is getting power. If you don't hear it running, check the circuit breaker to see if it has been flipped. If the circuit breaker is intact, then the problem may be with the dryer.

Next, check the lint filter in the dryer. It should be emptied after every load of laundry. Clogged lint filters can not only reduce airflow in the dryer, but they can also be a fire hazard. If the lint filter isn't the problem, move on to checking the outside vent for clogs. If wind is blowing towards the vent, a clog can cause the dryer to stop working.

If the outside vent is clear, then you should check the internal components of the dryer. Check the vent tube from the back of the dryer to the outside vent and make sure there are no obstructions. Also, disconnect the dryer vent hose at the dryer and check the blower fan inside to make sure it is running.

In some cases, the problem might be the heating element inside the dryer. This part allows air to be warmed and circulated around the dryer, drying the clothes. To test the heating element, you will need an ohmmeter. You can check your appliance repair manual to find out how to standard replace the heating element.

If these steps do not fix the dryer problems, it might be time to call a professional appliance repair technician. Qualified technicians will be able to diagnose the the issue and get the dryer running properly again.
