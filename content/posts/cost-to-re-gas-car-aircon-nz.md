Cost To Re-Gas Car Aircon NZ 

The cost of re-gassing a car's air conditioning system in New Zealand can vary significantly depending on the make and model of the vehicle, with prices starting at around $150 and going up to $400 or more. The main factors that will determine the cost are the type of refrigerant used in your car's system, how much is required to fill it back up and any additional services such as diagnostic checks or repairs that may be required. 

The first step is to identify what refrigerant your car uses - this information should be listed in your vehicle handbook or available online. Most cars use R134a, but there are other types such as R1234yf, R12 and R22 that may be used instead. Once you know what type you need, it’s time to find a reputable supplier who can provide it for you - many auto shops will stock a range of refrigerants so it shouldn’t be too difficult to find one close by. Some suppliers may even offer additional services such as diagnostic checks before they start work on recharging your system which could save time and money in the long run! 

Once you have sourced a supplier, they will then need to evacuate any remaining gas from your car’s system before filling it back up with fresh refrigerant. This process requires specialist equipment so ensure that whoever you choose has experience with this procedure and can guarantee their workmanship. It's also important to check what kind of warranty is included with the job - most companies should provide at least 12 months cover for any issues arising from their workmanship. 

Finally, once all necessary procedures have been completed the last step is for them to recharge your car’s system with new gas – generally this should take no longer than an hour but may require additional waiting time if diagnostic checks were performed beforehand. After everything has been done correctly then all that remains is for you to enjoy cool air coming out of your vents once again!
