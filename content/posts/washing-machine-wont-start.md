# Washing machine wont start

If your washing machine won't start, it can be a frustrating experience. There are a few things you can try before calling a repairman.

First, check the power supply. Make sure the washing machine is plugged in and the circuit breaker hasn't tripped. If the breaker has tripped, reset it and try again.

Next, check the door latch. If the door isn't completely closed, the machine won't start. Make sure the door is closed securely and the latch is engaged.

If the power supply and door latch are both working, check the timer and settings. Make sure the timer is set correctly and the settings are correct for the type of load you're washing.

If the timer and settings are correct, check the water supply. Make sure the water supply is turned on and the hoses are connected properly. If the water supply is off, turn it on and try again.

Finally, check the drain hose. Make sure the drain hose is not clogged or kinked. If the hose is clogged, clear the blockage and try again.

If none of these steps solve the problem, it may be time to call a repairman. Washing machines can be complex, and a professional may be able to diagnose and fix the issue.
