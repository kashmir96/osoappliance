## Finding the Perfect Refurbished Window Air Conditioner for Your Home or Office

Trying to find the perfect window air conditioner for your home or office? Buying a refurbished unit can save you money without having to sacrifice quality or performance. Here's a rundown of what to consider when shopping for a refurbished window air conditioner. 

When looking for a window air conditioner, you should start by looking into size. Consider the size of the room or space you would like to cool and then look for an air conditioner that can handle that size. Look at the power and BTUs (British Thermal Units) of a unit and make sure it's rated for the size of the space you'd like to cool.

Second, you need to pay attention to energy efficiency. Many refurbished window air conditioners will come from older models so make sure you determine how much energy it will use if you run it for extended periods. Also, keep in mind that the efficiency ratings show how much energy the unit uses at the highest setting, so you may be able to use lower settings and save on your electricity bill.

Third, you should pay close attention to noise output. As with older models, some of these refurbished air conditioners may be a bit louder than you'd prefer. Read reviews or check out the manufacturer's website to get an idea of what sound level you can expect. 

Finally, you should consider the cost. Refurbished window air conditioners can be quite affordable, but always take into account the cost of installation in addition to the unit. Many people opt for a professional installation to ensure everything is done properly. 

When shopping for a refurbished window air conditioner, it pays to do your research. Take into account such things as size, energy efficiency, noise levels and cost to make sure you find the perfect air conditioner for your home or office. 

Once you find the perfect refurbished window air conditioner, trust in a qualified and experienced technician to ensure that it's properly installed.
