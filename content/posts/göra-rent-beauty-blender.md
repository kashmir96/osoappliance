Göra rent beauty blenders are one of the hottest makeup tools out there right now. They have become a staple in any makeup artist's kit and are quickly becoming a must-have item for makeup enthusiasts everywhere. But, with all this use comes a lot of cleaning! Cleaning your beauty blender regularly is essential to keeping it in good condition and ensuring that it lasts you as long as possible. So, what is the best way to göra rent a beauty blender?

The first step is to rinse your beauty blender with warm water until all of the excess makeup has been removed from its surface. Once the sponge has been rinsed off, use an antibacterial soap or cleaner to thoroughly cleanse the sponge from top to bottom, making sure that no dirt or bacteria remain on its surface. Then, rinse off again with warm water until all of the soap is gone from your sponge and leave it out to dry on a paper towel or clean cloth. You should never put your wet beauty blender directly into your cosmetic bag – always let it air dry before placing it back into storage!

After drying, you can then apply some gentle cleanser such as baby shampoo or mild dish soap onto the beauty blender and massage it in gently with your fingers until all of the product has been removed from its surface. Rinse off thoroughly once again before leaving out once more to air dry completely. If you want an even deeper clean for stubborn stains, you can also add some baking soda paste onto your dampened sponge and work this into any problem areas before rinsing off once more and allowing time for drying afterwards. 

By following these simple steps regularly (ideally every few weeks) you should be able to keep your Göra rent Beauty Blender nice and clean so that it will last you for years!
