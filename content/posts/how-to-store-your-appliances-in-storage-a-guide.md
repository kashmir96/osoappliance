## Storing Your Appliances in Storage 

Ensuring your appliances are properly stored while temporarily placed in storage can help reduce damage, ensure a longer lifespan and provide a piece of mind. Follow these easy tips to ensure your appliances stay safe and secure until you’re ready to use them again.

### Preparing your appliances

Prior to putting your appliances into storage, it is important to ensure they are properly emptied and cleaned. Empty your appliances of any food items, use a soft rag and mild cleaning solution to clean the exterior, and take apart and clean any removable components as well. Once all of the internal and external components are clean and dry, make sure the doors are left slightly ajar to allow for some ventilation in a humid space.

### Preparing your storage unit

The most important step prior to storing your appliances is to make sure your storage unit is clean and dry. Clean the floors and walls and take necessary precautions such as pest control to prevent any critters from accessing your space. Place a few pallets on the floor for elevated support or to protect the floor from absorbing the moisture from any dripping or leaking.

### Storing your appliances

While storing your appliances, make sure they are wrapped in plastic or a special foam wrapper to protect them from dust, other items in storage, and any moisture. If possible, try storing your appliances in an upright position rather than sideways or upside down. This helps prevent any fluids from pooling and causing corrosion build up. With any refrigerators, make sure to keep the temperature level just above freezing.

### Assessing after storage

Once you take your appliances out of the storage, assess them to ensure all systems are working properly. Make sure to check that the seals are intact to protect against water and dust. Then clean the surfaces and internal components one more time before plugging them in and switching them on. 

Storing your appliances can be a hassle, but following the steps above and investing in a quality storage unit will help to ensure protection from any potential harm.
