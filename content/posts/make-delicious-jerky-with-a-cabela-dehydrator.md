## Making Delicious Homemade Jerky with a Cabela Dehydrator
 
If you love to have a healthy snack on the go, jerky is the perfect option. You can make it yourself at home with a Cabela Dehydrator and make sure you get the perfect flavor for you and your family. A dehydrator uses heat and low thermostat setting to evaporate the moisture from the food, in this case your jerky, giving you a chewy, delicious snack.

In a few easy steps, you can have your very own homemade jerky. Start by trimming the fat off your chosen meat and slicing it into thin, evenly sized strips. Then put your strips into a ziploc bag with your marinade of choice. Putting the marinade in the bag, then letting the meat soak in the marinade overnight, will give your jerky the extra flavor it needs.

When the meat has finished marinating, take it out of the bag and pat it dry with a paper towel. Once all your strips are dry, place them onto the trays of your Cabela Dehydrator and turn it on. Depending on the thickness of the meat, the drying period may take up to 8 hours. At the end of the dehydration process, your jerky should be chewy and not too dry. To keep it for a longer period of time, you should store your jerky in an airtight container.

Making your own jerky at home with the Cabela Dehydrator is a simple and easy process. This is a great way to add healthier snacks to your diet while taking control over what you and your family eat.
