## Examining Reasons for a Sudden Microwave Stop
Have you ever put something in the microwave, only for it to abruptly stop during the cooking cycle? This is an all-too-common occurrence, and it can be somewhat disconcerting. But it's important to stay calm and figure out the root of the problem before diving into a costly repair. There are numerous potential causes for a sudden stop that range from the simple to the complex. 

A trip to the breaker box is in order when dealing with a possible wiring issue. If a circuit breaker has been tripped, the power will not reach the appliance and it will immediately shut down. In some cases, the event may be due to a faulty connection within the microwave itself, rather than a problem with a circuit breaker. In that case, you can restart the microwave by unplugging the power cord, waiting a few minutes and then plugging it back in.

Ensuring that the microwave is an appropriate fit within the kitchen's layout is key. Make sure there is not too much space between the wall and the bottom of the microwave. Installing an over the range microwave properly can prevent overheating, shorts, and sudden stops lasting only a few seconds.

Blocked air ventilation can also be a major cause for both short and long term problems. Be sure that there is no tack, dust or other objects clogging up the backside vents. The microwave can also overheat from hot steam or food particles which are not cleaned properly on a regular basis. 

If the microwave has continued to stop even after making sure the circuit breaker is working, air vents are clear, and there is nothing wrong with the connection - it's time to consult a local professional for help. A qualified and certified appliance repair technician can quickly and accurately diagnose and repair the cause of the microwaveâ€™s abrupt stopping.
