## Natural Cleaning Solutions for Stainless Steel
It is important to keep your stainless steel appliances looking like new. Regular and routine cleaning can help keep your appliances looking beautiful and like new. However, not everyone has the time or the money to buy special store bought cleaners or wheel out the heavy duty appliances for deep cleaning. Luckily, with a few everyday ingredients, you can have your stainless steel appliances sparkling in no time.

One of the most effective natural cleaning alternatives for stainless steel is to use a paste made from water and baking soda. Start by mixing the two ingredients together until the mixture forms a paste. Apply it to the stainless steel surface then let it sit for a few minutes. Finally, using a dampened cloth, buff the sides of the appliance until the paste is gone.

Lemon juice and olive oil is also a great combination to naturally clean stainless steel appliances. Begin by pouring a small amount of lemon juice and adding a little bit of oil onto a cloth. Gently rub the surface of the stainless steel appliance with the cloth in a circular motion. Keep going until the entire surface has been treated. Finish up by wiping down with a dry cloth to remove any excess oil.

If you are looking for a quick and natural cleaning solution, white vinegar is the way to go. Combine an equal amount of white vinegar and water into a bowl, and then dip a microfiber cloth into the solution. Wipe down the surface of the stainless steel appliance using the microfiber cloth. Once all the surfaces are cleaned, be sure to rinse it off with a cloth dampened with plain water.

These easy and natural cleaning tips will help make sure your stainless steel appliances stay looking great. Try them out today and take advantage of the natural cleaning power of these common items.
