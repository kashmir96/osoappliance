## What to Make of 1 and 2 on an Espresso Machine?

We often take for granted the numerous household appliances that shape our daily lives. When something goes wrong with an appliance, however, we’re at a loss for what to do next. In these situations, the appliance’s user manual is the best resource - that, and our comprehensive appliance error codes glossary. In this blog, we will look specifically at espresso machines, and the mystery surrounding the numbers 1 and 2.

One of the most common experiences when it comes to espresso machines is encountering some form of error message. Usually, this will come in the form of a blinking code. A flashing light that reads “1” can indicate a flush error, meaning the boiler needs to cool down and the espresso machine needs to be flushed. On the other hand, a “2” could indicate either a temperature error or a water pressure error.

More often than not, these errors can be remedied simply by pressing the “reset” button. To ensure safety and avoid damage, users should be sure to consult their espresso machine’s manual before attempting to perform any DIY repair. With an understanding of the owner’s manual and an error codes glossary of your own, you’ll be armed with the correct knowledge to help you troubleshoot any issues with your espresso machine. 

For more complex problems, it's important to contact an authorized service center and have a professional look at your appliance. Not only will this help to ensure optimal use and safety of the machine, it might also reveal a hidden problem that only a trained technician would be able to spot.

At the end of the day, it’s important to remember that espresso machines are complex machines, and the best way to help them stay healthy and functioning efficiently for longer is to always consult the user manual and an error codes glossary.
