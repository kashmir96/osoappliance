Bathroom air can be a source of pollutants, such as mold spores, dust mites, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). An air purifier may help to reduce the amount of these pollutants in your bathroom.

An air purifier is an appliance that cleans the air by removing particles (such as pollen and dust) and other airborne contaminants from it. It works by drawing in contaminated air, filtering out the pollutants using a filter or other technology, and then releasing clean air back into the room. 

Air purifiers are designed to remove airborne contaminants such as dust mites, pet dander, smoke particles, bacteria and VOCs from your bathroom’s environment. The best way to choose an air purifier for your bathroom is to look at its Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). This measures how quickly an air purifier removes contaminants from a room’s environment; higher CADR ratings indicate better performance. 

You should also consider the size of your bathroom when selecting an appropriate model for your space. The size of the unit will determine how much area it can effectively clean in one cycle. If you have a large bathroom with high ceilings or multiple rooms within it then you may need a larger-sized unit to ensure adequate coverage. On the other hand if you have a smaller space then you may be able to get away with a smaller-sized model which is more energy efficient than its larger counterparts. 

Finally, some models come with additional features such as ionizers which produce negative ions that help improve indoor air quality by reducing odors and allergens in addition to trapping airborne particles like dust mites and pollen in their filters. Additionally some units come equipped with HEPA filters which are designed specifically for removing fine particulates such as smoke particles from indoor environments while others include activated carbon filters that can remove VOCs and odors from your bathroom’s atmosphere as well. 
 
Investing in an effective bathroom air purifier can help improve the overall quality of your home’s environment while also helping you breathe easier when spending time there!
