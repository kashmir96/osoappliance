## Error Code F3 E1: What to Do When Your Whirlpool Washer Stops Working

Having a working, reliable washing machine is a must-have in any household. When your Whirlpool washer suddenly stops working and displays an error code like F3 E1, it is a frustrating experience. The quick action of determining and fixing the issue can prevent further damage to the appliance.

The F3 E1 error code signals "overflow detected" on the washer. It is telling you that the unit is taking on too much water and either is overflowing or going to soon start overflowing. This can be caused by a few different things; a blockage in the drain line, too much laundry for the washer to handle, and a faulty drain pump to name a few. 

The first step is to unplug the washer from the electrical outlet and if the unit is still full of water, remove the water with an old towel or rag. If the washer is empty of water and you don’t have access to a soft cloth, you should use a vacuum to remove any lint or other debris that has collected in the basket/tub. 

Once this is done, check the drain hoses for clogs and blockages. If you find that the water is not draining properly, you can remove any possible clogs in the drain hose and the drain pump. If the drain pump is faulty, you may need the help of a trained and experienced appliance technician. 

It is important to take appropriate and timely action when dealing with a washing machine issue, especially one like the F3 E1 error code. Fixing the issue as soon as possible can prevent further damage to the unit and costly repair bills.
