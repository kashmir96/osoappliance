## Identifying & Fixing Washing Machine E4 Error
If you’re experiencing an E4 error code on your washing machine, you may already be feeling overwhelmed with the process of identifying and fixing the problem. The E4 error code indicates a problem with the pressure switch, which monitors the water’s flow into the drum. 

First things first, it’s important to identify the make and model of your washing machine so that you know how to access and fix the pressure switch. Depending on your model, you may also need to shut off the water supply valves before removing the sensor. There are high and low water pressure switches, so you will want to make sure you are replacing the correct part. 

If the pressure switch is clogged or jammed, it will be necessary to clean it with a rag or a brush. You may also need to replace the hose between the pressure switch and the washer drum. If the switch itself is broken, you may need to replace it. However, you should double check the manufacturer’s guide before replacing a broken switch as it could also be an indication that the water level control is malfunctioning.

In most cases, solving a washing machine E4 error code will require attention to proper maintenance and some troubleshooting. If your washing machine is still not functioning correctly after all the steps we’ve discussed, it may be time to seek the help of a professional.
