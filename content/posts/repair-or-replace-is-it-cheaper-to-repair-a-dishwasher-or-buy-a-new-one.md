## Should You Repair or Replace a Dishwasher?
When your dishwasher isn't functioning properly, it can be hard to decide whether it makes more sense to repair or replace it. The important thing to take into account when making this decision is the price. Will the repair cost be less than what it would cost to buy a new dishwasher?

When looking at repair costs, the first thing you should calculate is the cost of labor. If the problem is not covered by a warranty, you should consider adding that cost to the total repair expense. If there are parts to be replaced, you will want to compare their cost to the cost of a new model. Labor costs can vary significantly depending on the brand of dishwasher and the type of repair needed.

When it comes to replacing a dishwasher, you need to look at the overall cost of the new machine. If a new dishwasher will cost less than the combined cost of the repair and the labor, it may make more sense to go ahead with the replacement. Be sure to consider the cost of removing the old dishwasher and delivering and installing the new one.

If the dishwasher isnâ€™t too old, repairs may be your best bet. In most cases, the investment you put into the repairs should make it last for a few more years, thus making the price of the repair much cheaper than a brand-new machine.

In the end, the decision between repair and replace will depend on the cost of the repair, the cost of buying a new dishwasher, and how long you hope the dishwasher will continue to work.
