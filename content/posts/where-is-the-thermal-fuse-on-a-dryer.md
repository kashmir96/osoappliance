Thermal fuses are an important component of a dryer and help to prevent fires by cutting off the power supply if the dryer becomes too hot. The thermal fuse is usually located on the back or side of the dryer, depending on the model, and is usually near the heating element or motor. It can also be found behind a small access panel at the bottom or top of the dryer. 

In order to locate your thermal fuse, you will need to remove the back panel from your dryer. Once you have done this, you will be able to locate your thermal fuse more easily. The thermal fuse looks like a small white cylinder with two wires coming out of it. If you find that your thermal fuse is faulty, it is important that you replace it as soon as possible in order to ensure that your dryer continues to operate safely and efficiently. 

If you are not comfortable inspecting or replacing your own thermal fuse, it may be best to contact a professional appliance repair technician who can inspect and replace it for you. This will ensure that your appliance continues to operate safely and efficiently for years to come.
