## Is Your Washing Machine Not Finishing Its Cycle?

Are you dealing with a malfunctioning washing machine? A common problem many people face is having their washing machine not completing its cycle. It’s an annoying and tiresome situation that can cause a pile of wet clothes that can’t be used. There are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem and try and resolve it.

First, you should check to see if the power outage light is on. If it is, that means the power was disrupted during the cycle and the machine didn’t complete the wash. Try resetting the circuit breaker and seeing if that resolves the problem. If not, check if the water is being properly drained from the machine. If the machine isn’t emptying, the cycle won’t end. Make sure that the drain hose isn’t clogged up or kinked and the drain hose is installed correctly. 

If the power is working and the water is draining correctly, make sure the lid is completely shut and the lid switch is functioning properly. If the latch is worn out or loose, it may stop the wash cycle from finishing. If that is the source of the problem, it may be a good idea to replace the lid switch with a new one. 

Finally, check the water heater and the control board. If the temperature isn’t accurately set, the cycle will terminate early and your clothes will be cold and wet. You can adjust the water heat setting or the control panel to fix the problem.

Troubleshooting washing machines can sometimes be difficult, so if you’re still having problems with your machine finishing the cycle, it’s best to consult a professional, or check out our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary for more tips and insights.
