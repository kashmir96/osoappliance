A non-electric blender is a kitchen appliance that is used to mix, chop, emulsify, and liquefy ingredients. Unlike electric blenders, they are powered by manual effort. They are also known as manual blenders or hand blenders.

Non-electric blenders have been around for centuries and are much simpler in design than electric models. They typically consist of a container with a blade at the bottom, along with a crank or handle which is used to rotate the blade and blend the ingredients inside. 

The advantage of using a non-electric blender is that it requires no electricity to operate, which makes it perfect for outdoor use or during power outages. Additionally, non-electric blenders often require less clean up than their electric counterparts since there’s no need to worry about getting water all over electrical outlets and cords. 

Non-electric blenders can be used for a variety of tasks in the kitchen such as blending smoothies and purées, chopping vegetables and nuts, making salsa and guacamole dip, pureeing soups and sauces—the list goes on! 

One thing that you should keep in mind when using a non-electric blender is that you will need to apply more effort in order to get your desired results compared to an electric model due to its manual operation. Also, because these appliances typically don’t come with multiple speeds or settings like their electric counterparts do; you may have difficulty achieving smoother textures if you’re looking for something particularly fine—like baby food puree or creamy dressings or sauces—but if this isn’t an issue then these appliances will do just fine! 

Overall, non-electric blenders offer convenience without relying on electricity while still delivering great results when blending different ingredients together. If you’re looking for an easy way to quickly blend items together without having access to electricity then this type of appliance might be just what you need!
