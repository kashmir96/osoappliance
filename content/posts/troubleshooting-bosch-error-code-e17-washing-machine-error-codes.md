## Troubleshooting Bosch Washing Machine Error Code E17

This article has been created to help guide you through troubleshooting Bosch washing machine error code E17. Error code E17 may indicate a potential drain issue or a malfunction with your washing machine. It is important that you are aware of the potential danger of being in contact with electricity. If you approach the task with caution and patience, you should have no problem troubleshooting this error code.

The first thing to do when troubleshooting error code E17 is to unplug your washing machine from the wall socket and turn off the power to the appliance from the breaker. You should then check either the pressure hose, or the drainage hose for any blockages. This could be any obvious blockage, such as clothing or lint, or it could be a less obvious issue such as a kink in a hose or a damaged filter. It is also possible that the drain pump is defective, or that there is an issue with the wiring harness when the water level switch is being operated.

If you are unable to locate the source of the problem, you should contact a Bosch specialist or engineer. If this does not resolve the issue then you may need to contact Bosch directly for a new part.
