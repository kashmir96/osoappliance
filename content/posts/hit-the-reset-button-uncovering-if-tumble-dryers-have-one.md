## Do Tumble Dryers Have Reset Buttons?

We've all been there - a household appliance isn't working as expected and all we need to do is hit the reset button. But, do tumble dryers have reset buttons and how do you use them? In this blog, we'll be exploring these questions to help you get your tumble dryer back up and running. 

On the front or top of most tumble dryers, you'll find a control panel that looks something like a dashboard. Depending on the model of tumble dryer, there may or may not be a reset button included. Most tumble dryers do not have a reset button, however, some of the newer models may have a button that looks like a circle or hexagon with two arrows on either side. This is often used to reset the clock, timer or programming.

If there is no reset button, then it often means the manufacturer has built in a number of safety features and sensors which may have triggered if something isn't working properly. In this case, you'll first need to check your dryer's user manual to troubleshoot the issue. If that doesn't help, contact a qualified technician or the manufacturer. 

If your dryer does have a reset button, make sure the appliance is switched off and unplugged before you press it. This button is usually used to reset the timer and clock, however, if that doesn't help, then the issue is likely not the issue. In this case, it may be best to seek help from a professional that can identify the likely cause of the issue.

Reset buttons are a great way to quickly restore the factory settings of an appliance, however, make sure you consult your user manual before using any reset buttons. In many cases, resetting the appliance may not fix the underlying issue, so seeing a professional is often your best course of action.
