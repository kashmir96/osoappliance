## How Do Laundromats Clean Their Machines? 

Laundromats depend on their machines to keep their customers coming back and make them a profit. Keeping the machines clean and in good working order is essential to the success of any laundromat business. Fortunately, there are a few easy steps that can be taken to ensure that your laundromat's machines remain in great shape. 

The first step is to make sure that all of the machine's components are regularly checked for any signs of excessive wear or damage. If any damage is found, it should be noted and addressed as soon as possible so that it does not worsen over time and cause more costly repairs down the road. 

The second step involves regularly cleaning both the inside and outside of each machine with an approved cleaner designed specifically for laundry-machines. The cleaner should include ingredients such as bleach, vinegar, baking soda, or other disinfectants which will help remove bacteria and dirt from both interior surfaces as well as exterior surfaces such as buttons or screens which customers may come into contact with during use. 

Finally, all lint filters should be removed from each machine every few months (or at least once per year) in order to prevent fires from occurring due to built up flammable material around heating elements or motors which could ignite if left unchecked for too long a period of time. Regular maintenance like this will help ensure your laundry-machines stay in great condition over time! 

By taking these preventive steps owners can avoid costly appliance repairs later down the road; however if you do find yourself needing assistance our directory of [appliance repair technicians here](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) can help!
