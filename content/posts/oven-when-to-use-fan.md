If you're looking to get the most out of your oven, you may want to consider using fan-forced convection. Fan-forced convection is a type of cooking method that uses a fan to circulate hot air around the food, allowing for even cooking and faster cooking times. The fan helps to spread the heat evenly throughout the oven, resulting in more consistent temperatures and more even baking. This is especially beneficial when baking cakes, cookies, and other baked goods that require even heat distribution.

When using fan-forced convection, it's important to adjust the temperature settings on your oven accordingly. Generally speaking, you should reduce the temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit when using this type of cooking method. This will ensure that the fan doesn't blow away too much of the heat and result in undercooked food. Additionally, it's important to preheat your oven for at least 10 minutes before beginning to cook as this will help ensure that all of the elements are up to temperature and ready for use.

It's also important to note that some foods are better suited for fan-forced convection than others. For example, dishes like roasts and casseroles tend to benefit from this type of cooking method as it helps ensure that they are cooked evenly throughout. In addition, many types of breads and pastries can benefit from this type of baking as it helps create a crispier outer crust while keeping the inside soft and moist.

Overall, fan-forced convection is a great way to get more out of your oven by ensuring even temperatures throughout and faster cooking times. However, it's important to make sure you adjust your oven settings accordingly and preheat before beginning so that you can get the best results possible!
