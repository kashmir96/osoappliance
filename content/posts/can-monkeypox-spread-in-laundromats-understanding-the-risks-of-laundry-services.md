## Can Monkeypox Spread in Laundromats? Understanding the Risks of Laundry Services 

For many busy families, laundromats offer a convenient and time-saving option for getting large items of clothing or bedding washed. But before you take your items to the nearest washing machine, it's important to consider the risks associated with public laundry facilities. One possible risk is monkeypox transmission.

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that can cause mild skin illness in humans. While it's not common, it can be spread through contact with infected animals or humans; this could include coming into contact with contaminated clothing or bedding in a laundromat. It's also possible for someone to become infected by handling objects that have been contaminated by an infected person’s respiratory secretions (such as from coughing). 

When using public laundry services, it’s important to take steps to reduce your risk of exposure. This includes wearing protective gloves when handling the machines and laundering items at high temperatures where possible—it should be noted that some fabrics cannot withstand higher temperatures so always check care instructions first. Also, using detergents with disinfectant properties can help kill off any bacteria or viruses on fabrics before they’re returned home. 

Overall, while there is a small risk of monkeypox transmission in public laundry facilities, taking some simple precautions can help minimize this risk and make sure your family stays safe and healthy when doing their laundry. If you're looking for an alternative way to get big items washed without leaving home, then appliance rentals may be a better option as they provide access to washers and dryers without having to leave your house – [check out our directory of appliance rental companies here](./pages/appliance-rental) for more information!
