## Deciphering the Meaning of a Triangle on Laundry Care Instructions
Whether you’re a savvy laundry guru or a first-time washer, deciphering the meaning of a triangle on clothing care instructions can be a tricky task. Read on to discover exactly what the triangle symbol means and its implications when washing clothes.

The triangle on clothing care instructions is commonly used in Europe and other parts of the world to indicate that the item should not be washed. Although it might seem simple, the exact meaning of the triangle is actually more complex. With its three points, the triangle instructs the user to avoid washing, bleaching, and ironing. It’s an all-encompassing warning to not wet or otherwise alter these products in any way.

The triangle also often appears alongside other commonly-seen labels. For example, you may see a circle with a line through it, indicating that the item should not be dry-cleaned, or an “X” indicating that the item should not be tumbled-dried. You may even see all of these symbols — the triangle, circle and “X” — on one label, showing that the item should not be washed, bleached, ironed, dry-cleaned or tumble-dried.

Now that you understand the information the triangle is providing you, take time to understand the care instructions before laundering your clothes. Depending on the material, certain care instructions can have an impact on the life of your clothing item. Knowing the triangle’s meaning can help you properly care for and extend the life of your clothes.
