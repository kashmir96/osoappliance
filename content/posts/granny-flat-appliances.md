Granny flats are becoming increasingly popular as an alternate living arrangement for seniors and young adults alike. As such, granny flat appliances play a key role in making these spaces comfortable and functional. Granny flat appliances are small, space-saving versions of the typical household appliances found in larger homes. These smaller gadgets offer the same essential functions, but take up less space and energy than their full-sized counterparts.

Refrigerators are a must-have in any granny flat. While they may be smaller than traditional units, they still offer plenty of storage capacity and come with features like adjustable shelves and crispers to help you stay organized. Many also have energy star ratings to ensure they're as efficient as possible.

Stoves are another necessity for any kitchen or living area in a granny flat. Compact models offer all the basic amenities you need for cooking meals without taking up too much room or using too much electricity or gas. For even more convenience, consider getting one with a combination oven/stovetop to save countertop space while still having access to all your favorite recipes!

Microwaves provide quick and easy ways to heat up leftovers or defrost frozen items without needing a full-sized oven. Look for models that offer convection heating options so you can also bake items if desired! Some microwaves also feature built-in sensors that can detect humidity levels inside the unit so it knows when food is done cooking without any guesswork on your part! 

Finally, don't forget about laundry machines when outfitting your granny flat's appliances! Compact washers and dryers come equipped with many of the same features as their larger counterparts, such as adjustable spin speeds or temperature settings to ensure clothes come out clean yet still gentle enough on delicate fabrics. Plus, some even feature ventless drying technology which eliminates the need for an external venting system - perfect if you have limited space available! 

Granny flat appliances can provide all the comfort and convenience of regular household gadgets but with less energy usage (and often at a lower cost). Whether it's refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, or washers & dryers - there's something out there that'll fit perfectly into your unique living situation!
