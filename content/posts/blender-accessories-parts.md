Blender accessories are essential tools for any kitchen. They allow you to make a variety of recipes quickly and easily. Whether you’re making smoothies, soups, sauces or dips, the right blender accessories can make the job easier and faster. Here’s a breakdown of some of the most common blender accessories and their parts:

Blade Assembly: This is the part that attaches to the base of your blender and contains blades that chop up ingredients. Depending on your model, you may have one or two blade assemblies with different sizes and shapes to cut different types of food.

Cups/Containers: The cups or containers attach to the base of your blender and serve as a storage unit for all your ingredients before blending them together. Some models offer multiple cup sizes so you can store more food at once. 

Lids: These are usually plastic lids that fit securely over containers or cups to keep all the contents inside during blending. Some blenders come with additional lids for storing extra food in case you want to blend more than one batch at once. 

Plungers/Tamper Sticks: These are specially designed tools used to push down harder-to-blend items like ice cubes or fruits into the blades while mixing without having to stop and scrape down sides of container with a spoon or spatula every few seconds. 
 
Jar Grips: These attach directly onto jars so they can be securely held in place when blending without having any parts touching each other directly (especially useful when dealing with hot liquids.) They also help prevent spills by keeping everything tight during high speeds settings on blenders as well as allowing better grip while moving around container if needed while blending something thick like hummus dip etc.. 

Collars/Gaskets: This part fits between jar grip and container itself providing additional protection from splashing liquid when using higher speed settings on blenders as well as preventing leakage from occurring due to improper fitting between jar grip & container itself (can happen if not tightened enough). 

These are just some of the most common parts found in most modern blenders today; however, there may be several more depending on individual models available out there! Regardless, these components work together to ensure safe use for all types recipes so it’s important familiarize yourself before jumping into making any kind drinks/foods in order avoid potential accidents caused by improper handling etc..
