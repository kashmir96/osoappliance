## An Easy Way to Give Your Stainless Steel Appliances a Facelift

Stainless steel appliances are a classically stylish addition to any kitchen or home – however, they can accumulate dust, grime, and fingerprints over time. Fortunately, cleaning your stainless steel appliances with baking soda is an inexpensive and easy way to make them sparkle. 

The first step is to start with a damp cloth to wipe away any surface debris on the surface of your appliance. This can prevent the baking soda from causing a film or streak, which can leave an unpleasant texture. Then, make a mixture of one part baking soda and one part water. Dip a cloth or sponge into the mixture and gently scrub the appliance. Once the appliance is cleaned, rinse it off with water and dry it with a clean cloth. 

The beauty of this cleaning method is that it is a pure, natural product – no harsh chemicals, no expensive products. Plus, it smells nice! It also works great on range hoods, microwaves, ovens and more – giving you one excellent solution for a range of stainless steel appliances. 

Overall, cleaning your stainless steel appliances with baking soda is an inexpensive and all-natural approach to keep your home looking shiny and new. Whether you’re looking to give a facelift to a beloved classic oven or restore a range hood to its original sheen, baking soda can be an effective cleaning solution and keep your appliances looking great.
