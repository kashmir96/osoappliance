# Washing machine loud noise

Do you ever find yourself wondering why your washing machine is making loud noises? If so, you’re not alone. Washing machine noise can range from a low rumbling to a loud banging or clanging, and can be caused by a variety of problems. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the most common causes of washing machine noise, as well as some helpful tips for reducing or even eliminating the noise altogether.

One of the most frequent causes of noisy washing machines is an imbalanced load. If the clothes in your washing machine are unevenly distributed, the load will be unbalanced, which will cause the washer to rock back and forth and make loud noises. To prevent this, try to evenly distribute the clothes and lightly tap down the pile before starting the machine.

It could also be items that have fallen out of your clothes being thrown around inside the drum, pump or other locations in the machine, which can cause loud thumping noises. To help avoid this, make sure to shake out your clothes and pockets before putting them in the machine.

Another common cause of loud noises is worn or broken components within the washing machine. Over time, parts like the drum's bearings and motor may wear down and become loose, which will lead to rattling noises. In this case, you should contact a professional to inspect and repair your machine.

Loose parts, such as the washer’s hoses or bolts, can also be the source of noise. Check to make sure these parts are securely attached to the machine. If you find any that are loose, tighten them up.

Finally, it’s possible that the noise is being caused by the detergent you’re using. If you’re using an aggressive detergent, it can cause the washer to vibrate and make loud noises. Try switching to a mild detergent or a detergent specifically designed for top-loading washing machines.

Noisy washing machines can be annoying, but with a few simple steps, you can find the source of the noise and take steps to reduce or eliminate it. Try evenly distributing the clothes, checking for loose parts, and switching to a mild detergent to help reduce or eliminate washing machine noise.
