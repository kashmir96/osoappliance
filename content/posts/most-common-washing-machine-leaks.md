Washing machine leaks can be one of the most annoying and costly problems in a home. Whether it’s a small drip or a major flood, washing machine leaks can cause significant damage to your home and possessions. Knowing what causes common washing machine leaks can help you prevent them from happening in the first place.

One of the most common sources of washing machine leaks is the supply hoses. These hoses connect the water source to your washer and over time, they can become worn out or loose causing them to leak. This is why it’s important to regularly inspect these hoses for any signs of wear and tear and replace them when necessary. Additionally, check for water hammering as this can be another sign that your supply hose may need replacing.

Another common source of washing machine leaks is from worn-out door seals. The seal prevents water from seeping out when the washer is on but if it becomes worn down or cracked then you will likely have a damp floor around your washer when it’s finished its cycle. Replacing these seals regularly will help keep your floors dry and reduce leaks significantly.

Finally, clogged drains are another potential source of washing machine leaks that should not be overlooked. When drains become clogged with lint or other debris, they won’t allow excess water to flow freely away which causes it to build up inside your washer instead leading to potential flooding issues should something go wrong during operation. To avoid this problem, make sure you clean out all drain lines at least once every few months so that everything stays flowing smoothly without any blockages forming along the way. 

By understanding what causes common washing machine leaks you can take steps such as regular inspections and maintenance to prevent them from occurring in the first place – saving you time, money, and stress down the road!
