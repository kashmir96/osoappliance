## Make the most out of your Mi Home App

Controlling your robot vacuum with your Mi Home app is an efficient way to tackle your daily tasks and make life much easier. With the help of your app, you can keep track of your robot's cleaning schedule, real-time status and route, and remote control it without having to be physically present. So, let's explore how to properly utilize your app to gain the best performance out of your robot vacuum. 

For starters, most Mi Home apps require registration with a Xiaomi account to gain access. A QR code connection is available or you can use a Mi Home product key which is often found on the product packet. After that, your app will provide you features such as setting a cleaning schedule, checking the current and past routes, setting no-go zones and navigation. You can also tune up the cleaning power by controlling the power modes. 

Monitoring your robot vacuum's performance is also made simpler with the help of your Mi Home app. Through the app, you can keep track of real-time cleaning status, power levels and other statistics that can help analyze the robot's performance. When the robot is low on battery power, it will automatically go back to the charging dock and inform you about the same. In case of any issues, the app can help diagnose the problem and support customer service. 

So that's the gist of how Mi Home App can help you gain the best performance out of your robot vacuum.
