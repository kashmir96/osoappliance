Oven cleaner is a powerful chemical that can be highly dangerous if not handled and used correctly. While it is an effective way to clean and maintain your oven, there are some risks associated with its use that you should be aware of before using it.

First, oven cleaners contain hazardous chemicals like sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda or lye, and phosphoric acid. These corrosive materials can cause severe burns on skin contact and are highly toxic when inhaled or ingested. Even short-term exposure to them can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. For this reason, it’s important to always wear protective gloves when handling the cleaner and other cleaning products in the home.

Second, oven cleaners produce noxious fumes that may be noxious even when used outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. If you’re using an aerosol cleaner indoors, make sure you open all windows to allow adequate ventilation while working; otherwise you could possibly suffer from headaches or dizziness as a result of inhaling the chemicals. Similarly, if you have pets or children around while using an oven cleaner always keep them at a safe distance away from any fumes given off by the product. 

Finally, many oven cleaners are combustible and should never come into contact with open flames or sparks created by electrical appliances near your stovetop area; these could spark a major fire very quickly if exposed to high temperatures caused by these objects! Therefore it is important to read all manufacturer safety instructions carefully before using any type of oven cleaner in order to ensure your safety at all times. 

Overall, although oven cleaners are effective for cleaning your appliances they do come with certain associated risks so it's essential that they're handled carefully and appropriately at all times in order to avoid any serious accidents occurring!
