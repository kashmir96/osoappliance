## When Your Samsung Dryer Displays the TC Error Code 

Are you dealing with a Samsung dryer displaying a TC error code? It can be easily fixed with some basic troubleshooting. By understanding what the code is and why it pops up, you can be more prepared to tackle the issue and keep your dryer running in top condition.

The TC error on Samsung dryers is an indication that the unit has an issue with the thermistor or temperature sensor. This component helps measure the dryerâ€™s temperature and communicates with the internal control board of the unit. If something goes awry with the component, the internal controls see an out of range error, and your dryer will then deactivate to avoid any further issues.

To fix a TC error code, you should first check on the thermistor itself. Inspect its wiring for any potential damages that may have occurred and ensure all of the wire connections are still intact. It is also beneficial to measure the readings coming from the thermistor because the output should be close to 10k ohms at room temperature.

Next, you should move on to inspecting the vent system. Be sure to make sure it is not clogged with lint or has any structural damages like bends or kinks in the vent tubing that may be blocking airflow.

Once all of these steps are complete, you can attempt to reset the unit by unplugging it. After a couple of minutes have passed, plug the unit back into the wall outlet and hit the start button. Your dryer should now be back to normal.

If the TC code continues even after taking these necessary steps, it may be a potential sign of a deeper underlying issue. If it does, you may want to reach out to a to a professional appliance repair technician for further diagnosis. 

Overall, the TC error code from a Samsung dryer is not a formidable issue but it should not be taken lightly. Taking the necessary steps to properly diagnose and resolve this error is the best way to ensure the issue is taken care of correctly.
