## Error Code E2 and Its Meaning For Your GE Washing Machine
When a washing machine malfunctions, one of the most common indicators is that it will display a specific error code or series of flashing LED lights. Error Code E2 is a common LED light indicator that signals an issue with your General Electric washing machine. Here, we'll discuss the error code itself, what it means, and how to fix your GE washing machine.

Error Code E2 is a Water Level Pressure sensing switch error. This means that the water level pressure switch has exceeded the washing machine's pre-determined limits. This switch is responsible for the proper functioning of the machine, by regulating the water level and pressure within the drain hose. When the switch is malfunctioning, it can cause the excess build-up of pressure, often resulting in incorrect water levels and inefficiencies.

Though this error is typically an easy fix, it’s best to consult a repair professional for assistance. This is particularly true if the error code persists even after the attempt to reset the water-level pressure. A repair professional will be able to properly diagnose any further issues and can help you get your washing machine back up and running in no time.

It's important to stay on top of repairing your washing machine as this error — if unresolved — has the potential to cause more substantial and costly damages to your machine. As soon as you identify Error Code E2, it's time to contact a qualified service center and schedule an appointment.

Error Code E2 is a common issue, but identifying and addressing the error in a timely manner can help ensure that the problem does not compound and result in further — and more expensive — repairs. If you experience this error code with your GE washing machine, make sure you get in contact with a reliable repair service as soon as possible.
