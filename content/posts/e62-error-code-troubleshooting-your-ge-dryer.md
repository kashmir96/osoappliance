## Troubleshooting the E62 Error Code on a GE Dryer

When a GE Dryer stops working correctly and displays an E62 error code, the cause could range from a simple to a more complex issue. Knowing the troubleshooting steps for this code can help get your dryer back in working order.

To help resolve the E62 error code in a GE Dryer, start by unplugging the device and plugging it back in again. This will cause the machine to automatically reset its settings and give you another chance to start a new cycle. 

If it continues to display the error code, the issue could be with the moisture sensor. To test the moisture sensor, start by opening up the dryer. Locate the moisture sensor and remove it. Attach a multimeter to the two terminals of the sensor. You should see a slightly increased reading that will become higher the longer it is left attached. If the multimeter does not detect anything, the moisture sensor needs to be replaced.

Alternatively, the problem could be related to the motor overheating. To inspect this, unplug the dryer and remove the back panel to access the motor. Make sure there is no debris build-up that could be blocking the air flow and causing the motor to overheat. Cleaning the motor can often resolve the issue.

When the source of the E62 Error Code is not immediately clear, it is important to consult the dryerâ€™s User Manual, which typically outlines the steps to troubleshoot the code. A user can also reference our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to find a full list of error codes, along with their explanations and solutions. 

The E62 error code can be rectified if users take timely action and tinker with the moisture sensor or the motor. If the issue persists or cannot be diagnosed, then the best option is to consult a repair expert.
