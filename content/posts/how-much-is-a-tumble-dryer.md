A tumble dryer is an appliance that uses heated air to dry clothes and other fabrics. It is a convenient way to dry clothes quickly and efficiently without having to hang them up or lay them out in the sun. Tumble dryers come in a variety of sizes, styles, and prices, so it can be difficult to determine how much one will cost. 

The price of a tumble dryer can vary greatly depending on the size, features, and brand. Generally speaking, the larger the capacity of the dryer (measured in cubic feet) and the more features it has (such as steam settings or energy efficiency), the more expensive it will be. Basic models can start around $200 while more advanced models can range up to $2,000 or more. 

When shopping for a tumble dryer, it's important to consider your needs and budget before making a purchase. Think about how often you will be using the appliance and what types of fabrics you will be drying with it. You should also consider energy efficiency ratings when looking at different models - an energy-efficient model may cost more upfront but could save you money in the long run on your energy bills. 

Overall, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to determining how much a tumble dryer costs - prices can range from under $200 for basic models up to several thousand dollars for higher-end options with all of the bells and whistles. Take some time to research different models and compare prices before making your decision so that you can find one that fits both your needs and your budget.
