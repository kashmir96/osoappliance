Most of us love a good bargain, but when it comes to washing machines, the sky's the limit when it comes to price. In fact, some of the most expensive washing machines ever made have price tags that rival the cost of luxury cars. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line machine that can give you professional-level results at home, then these are some of the most expensive washing machines ever made. 

The Miele W1 TwinDos is one of the most expensive washing machines ever released. It's a high-end front loader with a 7kg capacity and boasts features like an automatic dosing system for detergent and fabric softener, as well as an steam option for better cleaning results. The machine has been designed with an innovative AutoDose system which automatically dispenses detergent at the right amount based on the load size and water hardness level. It also has 16 wash programs to choose from and a range of special functions including delicate cycles for silk and wool fabrics. With all its bells and whistles, this machine will set you back around $3200 AUD - making it one of the most expensive washing machines on the market today!

The Bosch WAW285H2UC is another pricey option that offers great performance in exchange for its hefty price tag. It's an energy efficient front loader with an 8kg capacity and features like AquaStop Plus Technology to prevent leaks during washes, as well as SpeedPerfect which shortens your wash time by up to 65%. This machine also has 18 wash programs including ones dedicated for specific types of fabrics like wool or silk so you can always get just what you need from each cycle. This model is priced around $2900 AUD - making it one of the more luxurious options if you're in search of top-notch quality from your washer! 

Last but not least we have LG's flagship model - The LG WM9500HKA Signature TwinWash Machine with Steam Technology. This 9kg capacity washer promises amazing performance thanks to its advanced AI technology which uses artificial intelligence to detect different types of fabric before selecting optimal settings accordingly - ensuring perfect results each time! On top of this impressive feature, it also boasts 20 distinct wash cycles (including Quick Wash) and powerful steam technology which can remove wrinkles without causing any damage - making it perfect even delicate fabrics like cashmere or lace! But that comes at a cost; this machine clocks in at around $5200 AUD so be sure you really need all these features before splurging on this luxurious appliance!
