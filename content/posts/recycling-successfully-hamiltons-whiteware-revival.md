## Reviving Hamilton's White Goods By Recycling

When it comes to recycling and reducing household waste, Hamilton in New Zealand was making history. Hamilton city was the first in the world to offer a comprehensive white-ware revival service. This service offers a range of solutions to a variety of whitegood items and allowing appliances that are unsuitable for repair to be collected for recycling. 

With the closure of some major whitegoods outlets, Hamilton had the perfect opportunity to create a sustainable resource from most disposable items in their electronic environment. As part of their commitment to industry best practice, Hamilton city council established a "Whiteware Revival" program with an aim to reduce the amount of electronic waste that would be heading to landfill. This program has continued to be a great success, with more than 5000 whitegoods being recycled and reused every year. 

This innovative program has allowed for the many of the whitegoods being recycled to be put to use within the local community. Upon collection, items are assessed by experienced technicians and categorized according to their suitability for repair or recycle. For items suitable for repair, they are then resold to the public at a discounted price, giving them the chance to extend the use of their electronics. 

For items that are not suitable for repair or reuse, they are then sent to experienced recycling companies where they will then be responsibly disposed of to minimize impact on the environment.

Hamilton's Whiteware Revival has shown to be a great success in reducing waste, while reusing and recycling items to enable people to extend their use of electronics. By engaging with a forward thinking approach to electronic waste, it shows that communities can be instrumental in creating and supporting more sustainable futures.
