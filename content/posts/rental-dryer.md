If you’re in the market for a rental dryer, it’s important to understand some of the key terms associated with these machines. Knowing what these terms mean can help ensure that you get exactly what you need and make sure your machine runs efficiently. Here are some of the most common rental dryer terms: 

1) Capacity: The capacity of a rental dryer refers to how much laundry it can hold at once. Some machines have larger capacities than others, so make sure you choose one that is suitable for your needs. 

2) Efficiency: Efficiency measures how much energy a rental dryer uses per load. An efficient machine will save money on energy costs and will also help conserve resources. 

3) Heat Settings: This refers to the number of different temperature settings available on a given machine. Different fabrics require different temperatures, so having multiple settings allows you to customize the drying process to each load. 

4) Timers: Many modern rental dryers come with timers that allow you to set when your laundry is finished drying and automatically shut off once it has completed its cycle. This helps conserve energy by preventing over-drying and helps save time as well! 

5) Damp Alerts: This feature lets users know when their clothes are finished drying but still slightly damp so they can be taken out before wrinkles form or mildew begins to grow in damp areas of fabric such as pockets or cuffs. 

 Understanding these rental dryer terms will help ensure that you get exactly what you need from your machine! Be sure to take into account all of these features when making your selection so that you won’t regret it down the line!
