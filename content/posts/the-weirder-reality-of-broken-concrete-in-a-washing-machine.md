## The Unexpected Reality: Concrete in a Washing Machine 
One of the strangest appliance mishaps that can happen is broken concrete pieces making their way into a washing machine. This is usually a very expensive mistake and one that poses some safety dangers as well. While this isn’t a common problem, it can occur so people should understand the consequences and take preventive steps.

Washing machines are designed to handle clothes, detergents, and small items such as coins. If pieces of concrete are thrown into the washing machine, the internal parts can be damaged or broken, the machine can become overworked and can lead to an expensive repair or replacement. Furthermore, broken chunks and dust from concrete can cause overexposure to concrete dust. This exposure can increase the risk of skin irritation, coughing and even asthma. Concrete dust may contain chemical ingredients that can also cause more serious health risks and should be avoided.

If there are any broken pieces of concrete in the washing machine, the safest option is to stop the operation immediately, unplug the machine and take steps to safely remove the pieces from the drum. It’s important to use protective gear, such as gloves and a face mask, when cleaning up concrete in the washing machine. If any damage to the washing machine occurred, contact a professional appliance repair technician to assess the damages and to recommend the needed steps to repair the machine.

The best way to avoid this type of problem is to take preventive measures and remember to check pockets and clothing before washing them. If any large pieces are found, put them in the trash can or anywhere that does not include the washing machine.
