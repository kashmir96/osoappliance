When it comes to buying an oven, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for the price. The cost of an oven can vary greatly depending on the type, size, and features you are looking for. A basic countertop oven may cost anywhere from $50 to $200, while a more advanced convection oven could cost over $1,000.

If you’re looking for a basic countertop model, you’ll likely find that prices range from $50 to around $200. These models are typically small and have limited features such as temperature settings and timer functions. They may also have a few basic cooking functions such as baking and roasting.

If you’re looking for something a bit more advanced, you can expect to pay upwards of $300 or more for a convection oven. These models typically feature multiple cooking functions such as baking, roasting, broiling and grilling. They also often come with additional features such as digital temperature controls and timers. Convection ovens can also be larger than countertop models, allowing them to accommodate larger dishes or multiple dishes at once.

Finally, if you’re looking for the most advanced model available, you could be looking at prices over $1,000 or more. These high-end models often feature multiple cooking functions such as convection baking and roasting along with additional features like digital temperature controls and timers. They are also usually much larger than other models so they can accommodate larger dishes or multiple dishes at once.

Ultimately, the price of an oven will depend on what type of model you’re looking for and what features it has. If you’re on a budget, there are plenty of basic countertop models available in the $50-$200 range that will do the job just fine. If you’re willing to spend more money on an advanced model with additional features like digital temperature controls and timers then expect to pay upwards of $300 or more for a convection oven or even over $1,000 for the most advanced model available.
