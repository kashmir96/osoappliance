If your dryer smells like burning, it can be a sign of a serious problem. The smell of burning could be caused by a buildup of lint in the dryer, a faulty heating element, or a worn out belt. It’s important to take action quickly to avoid a potential fire.

Lint Buildup

Lint buildup is a common cause of a burning smell from your dryer. Lint is created from clothing, towels, and other items that you dry. It accumulates in the lint trap, vent, and other areas of the dryer. If it’s not cleaned out regularly, it can cause the dryer to overheat and create a burning smell. To prevent this from happening, clean out the lint trap after every load.

Faulty Heating Element

A faulty heating element can also cause a burning smell. The heating element is responsible for generating the heat that dries your clothes. If the heating element is faulty, it can overheat and create a burning smell. To determine if the heating element is the problem, unplug the dryer and take off the back panel. If you see any damage to the heating element, it needs to be replaced.

Worn Out Belt

A worn out belt can also cause a burning smell. The belt is responsible for spinning the drum of the dryer. If it’s worn out or has become loose, it can cause the drum to rub against the heating element, creating a burning smell. To fix this problem, you’ll need to replace the belt.

If your dryer smells like burning, it’s important to take action quickly to avoid a potential fire. Check for lint buildup, a faulty heating element, or a worn out belt. If any of these problems are present, take steps to repair or replace the part.
