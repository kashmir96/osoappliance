## An Easy Solution to Whirlpool Cabrio F82 Error Code 
If you own a Whirlpool Cabrio appliance and you've encountered an F82 error code, fear not. This issue can easily be fixed.

F82 is an indication of a faulty temperature sensor inside the appliance that is unable to measure and report the temperature accurately. The best solution in this situation is to simply replace the sensor, which can be done easily.

The first step is to turn off the power to the appliance and disconnect the unit from the electrical outlet. Once the power is off, you'll need to locate the temperature sensor, which is located behind the lower kick panel or front panel, depending on the model. The panel needs to be removed in order to access the sensor. 

Once the panel is removed and the temperature sensor is visible, end of the connector and locate the sensor. The sensor is a small black tube that's located in the center of the appliance. Remove any excess screws and then carefully unplug the sensor before removing it.

Next, install the new temperature sensor in the same location. Be sure to plug the sensor in securely and then reinstall the kick panel or access panel.

Finally, turn the power back on and test the appliance by running a cycle to see if the F82 error code is no longer present. 

If you have followed the steps above and the F82 error code is still present, it's time to call in a professional appliance repair technician for assistance. A technician can diagnose the issue quickly and make any necessary repairs to get your appliance back in working order.
