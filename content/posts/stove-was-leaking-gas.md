If you have recently noticed that your stove is leaking gas, it is important to take action immediately. A gas leak can be a dangerous situation and should not be ignored. Here are some steps you can take to address a leaking stove:

1. Shut off the gas supply. If you smell gas in your home, shut off the main gas supply valve immediately. This will help prevent any further leaks from occurring.

2. Contact a professional. If you suspect that your stove is leaking gas, it is best to contact a professional for assistance. A qualified technician can come to your home and inspect the appliance, identify the source of the leak, and make any necessary repairs.

3. Inspect the connections and seals. Once you have shut off the main gas supply, inspect all of the connections and seals on your stove for signs of wear or damage. If any of these components appear to be damaged or worn out, they should be replaced as soon as possible to avoid further leaks or potential explosions.

4. Replace faulty parts as needed. Depending on the age of your stove, certain parts may need to be replaced due to wear and tear over time. If this is the case, it is important to replace them with new parts that are designed for use with your specific model of stove in order to ensure proper functioning and safety. 

5. Have your appliance serviced regularly. To avoid future problems with your stove or other gas appliances in your home, it is important to have them serviced regularly by a qualified technician who can inspect all of their components for signs of wear or damage and make any necessary repairs or replacements as needed. 

By following these steps, you can help ensure that your stove is safe and functioning properly at all times so that you can enjoy its use without worrying about potential risks from a gas leak!
