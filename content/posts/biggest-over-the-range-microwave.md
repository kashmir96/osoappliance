If you’re looking for a large, powerful, and convenient microwave oven, then an over the range (OTR) model is probably the best choice. OTR microwaves offer a combination of size and power that makes them ideal for large families or anyone who needs to cook or reheat larger dishes. The biggest OTR microwaves on the market have a capacity of 2.2 cubic feet or more and feature powerful cooking elements with up to 1,200 watts of power.

These larger models are perfect for cooking multiple dishes at once as well as reheating leftovers quickly and evenly. They also come with convenient features like convection baking that allow you to turn your microwave into an oven-like appliance capable of baking pies, cakes, and other treats. Some models even include sensors that detect humidity levels in food so you can achieve perfectly cooked results every time without having to guess how long something should be cooked for.

The biggest benefit of an OTR microwave is its size; most models measure about 30 inches wide by 15 inches high by 16 inches deep which allows you to fit them into almost any kitchen configuration without having to worry about clearance issues around cabinets or countertops. Most also come with adjustable mounting brackets so you can position it at your desired height without worrying about it being too low or too high off the ground. The additional space inside these larger microwaves also gives you more flexibility when it comes to types of dishes you can cook; they’re great for preparing full meals as well as snacks like popcorn or nachos since they have enough room inside to accommodate multiple plates at once.

Overall, if you need a lot of space in your kitchen but don’t want to sacrifice performance when it comes to heating food quickly and evenly then an over the range microwave is definitely worth considering!
