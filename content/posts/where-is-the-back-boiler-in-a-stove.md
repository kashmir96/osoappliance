A back boiler is an essential component of a stove, as it is responsible for providing hot water and heating in the home. It is located at the rear of the stove and is connected to a hot water tank or cylinder.

The back boiler functions by taking advantage of the heat generated by burning fuel such as wood, coal or gas. The heat passes through a flue pipe into the boiler where it heats up water which is stored in a hot water tank. This heated water can then be used for central heating and hot water supply in homes.

Back boilers are an efficient way to heat homes, as they take advantage of existing heat produced by burning fuels, rather than having to generate more energy. However, they can be inefficient if not maintained properly as dirt and debris can build up over time reducing their efficiency. Itâ€™s important to have your back boiler regularly serviced and cleaned to ensure its optimal performance. 

In addition to providing heating and hot water for homes, back boilers also offer other advantages such as being able to power cookers and ovens for cooking food. This makes them an ideal choice for those who want a multifunctional solution that can provide both warmth and convenience in one package.
