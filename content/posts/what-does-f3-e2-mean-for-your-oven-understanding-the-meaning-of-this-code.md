## Understanding the F3 E2 Oven Code

Ovens have become a commonplace household appliance, but many people are unaware of what their codes and error messages mean. The “F3 E2” code is a common error message associated with ovens. Understanding this code is essential to properly maintain and repair your oven, as well as ensure safety while cooking.

F3 E2 is an error code typically found on ovens with electronic control boards. It indicates that the oven temperature has exceeded the maximum range, usually 500-570 degrees Fahrenheit. This code tends to appear during the self-cleaning process, during which the oven heats past the normal ranges in order to burn the dirt off.

If your oven displays this code, it is likely that the temperature has exceeded the preset maximum and trigger the safety circuit. In cases such as this, it is important to take precautions and keep yourself and your family safe by unplugging the appliance and allowing it to cool.

If your oven displays the F3 E2 code regularly, you may need to call in a professional for repairs and replacements. In some cases, it could be indicative of something like a faulty oven control board or a bad temperature sensor. Oven control boards are essential in regulating the temperature of an oven and keeping it at an acceptable range.

To ensure that your oven functions correctly, it is important to understand the code and take the necessary action. If you have any concerns, we recommend calling a qualified specialist for servicing and repairs.
