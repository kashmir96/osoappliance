If you’ve recently purchased a Harvest Right Freeze Dryer, you’ll want to get the most out of it by purchasing some helpful accessories. Accessories can help you make the most of your freeze drying experience and expand your food-preserving possibilities. Here are some of the top accessories for Harvest Right Freeze Dryers:

1. The Mylar Bag Kit – This kit includes everything you need to store and protect your freeze dried food in Mylar bags with an oxygen absorber. The kit includes 25 each 1-gallon, 2-gallon and 5-gallon mylar bags with oxygen absorbers and labels, so you can quickly and easily package your freeze dried food for long-term storage.

2. Extra Trays – Extra trays give you extra room in your freeze dryer so that you can process more food at once. They also make it easier to organize different types of foods into separate batches, so that flavors don’t mix together during processing.

3. Vacuum Sealer – A vacuum sealer is a great tool for packaging up finished product for long term storage or for short-term use like camping trips or backpacking trips where weight is a factor because it removes air from the packaging which reduces bulkiness and helps preserve the shelf life of snacks like jerky or fruit leathers by blocking out light, moisture, bacteria, molds, etc., that could cause spoilage over time. 

4. Desiccant Packets – Desiccant packets help absorb moisture from the air inside packages to extend shelf life of products like jerky or grains that are stored in a pantry or shelf. 
 
5. Freeze Dryer Stand – If you want to store and use your freeze dryer in a different location, the freeze dryer stand is perfect for giving it a stable base and allowing it to be easily moved. It also helps keep the unit off the ground for easy cleaning and storage of accessories.

These are some of the top accessories for Harvest Right Freeze Dryers that can help you get even more out of your food preservation experience!
