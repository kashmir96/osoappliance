## Getting Creative with Your Old Heat Pump
Do you have an old heat pump? If so, you may be wondering what you can do with it. Don’t throw it out! Reusing and revamping an old heat pump can provide an extra layer of comfort and convenience to your home. 

The lifespan of a heat pump varies heavily depending on the model and general maintenance performed on it. Heat pumps usually last for about 15 years, with some brands lasting significantly longer. Before discarding your old heat pump, assess its condition to see if it’s worth keeping. If the parts are functioning correctly, then you can move on to selecting a new, improved model 

You may be thinking, “Okay, so I can’t throw it away, but what can I do with an old heat pump?” There are a variety of ways to use and repurpose your heat pump beyond its intended function. Here are a few ideas: 

* Use it to regulate your attic’s temperature. Older homes may lack sufficient insulation. By installing an old heat pump in your attic, you can warm it during the winter and cool it off during the summer. Make sure there’s sufficient supply and return air ducts present.

* Create an energy-efficient home office. If you work from home, you may appreciate the added comfort of a heat pump in your office. Whether you have a designated space for your at-home job or you take up residence in the den, an efficient heat pump will keep your workspace comfortable.

* Upgrade your outdoor living area. By installing a heat pump in your outdoor living space, you can create an area for family and friends to congregate year-round. Your garage workshop, outdoor workshop, or backyard patio can become an extension of your home with a properly installed heat pump.

Buying a brand new heat pump can provide optimal convenience and comfort to your home. However, by taking the time to reuse and revamp an old heat pump, you can still reap the benefits without the burden of additional costs. Consider these options and start taking advantage of the potential of your old heat pump.
