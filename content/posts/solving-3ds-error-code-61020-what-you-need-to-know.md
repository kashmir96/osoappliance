## Troubleshooting the 3ds Error Code 61020

If you are a user of a household appliance and you're stuck with 3ds Error Code 61020, don't worry, there's help on hand. Knowing the right steps to take can get your appliance running again.

The first possible issue with Error Code 61020 is that your Nintendo 3DS doesn't recognize that the router is compatible with its system. This can be reset by turning the two devices off and then back on again. To do this, hold the POWER button on your 3DS until it shuts down, then unplug power to your router and wait at least 10 seconds before turning it back on. Once both are back on, try to reconnect. 

Another possible issue is that your Nintendo 3DS could overheat and cause Error Code 61020. Make sure the 3DS is placed in a well-ventilated area, not tucked away in a drawer or covered by excess blankets or other clothing. If it is already in a well-ventilated area, be sure to periodically shut it down and restart it, so that it doesn't stay on for long periods of time. 

Finally, Error Code 61020 could be due to the connection between the Nintendo 3DS and the router. You should check that the connection is secure and that there is no interference (i.e. a wall blocking the connection). If the connection is weak, you may need to move the router closer to the 3DS or purchase a signal repeater / extender in order to strengthen it. 

By taking these steps, you can help increase your chances of solving 3ds Error Code 61020.
