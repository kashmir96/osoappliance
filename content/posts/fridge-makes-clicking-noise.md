If your fridge is making a clicking noise, it may be a sign that something is wrong with it. The most common cause of this noise is the compressor trying to start up but unable to do so. This could be due to a problem with the compressor motor or the thermostat. Fortunately, there are some things you can try yourself before contacting a repair service.

One of the first things you should do if your fridge makes clicking noises is check its power supply. Make sure that everything’s plugged in properly and that there’s no voltage problems from the outlet or circuit breaker box. If there’s an issue here, it could prevent your fridge from running properly and producing those clicking sounds.

Next, verify if the compressor fan and condenser coils are both clean and unobstructed. The condenser coils need to be able to dissipate heat effectively for your fridge to run at optimal levels and produce cold air for cooling food items stored inside it . Dust accumulation on these components can reduce their efficiency, causing them to struggle when attempting to start up and make those clicking noises in return . Cleaning these components regularly can help ensure they remain effective at cooling down your fridge properly .

If all of these steps have been taken with no success , then you may need professional assistance , as the issue may require more advanced knowledge or technical work which only an experienced serviceman can provide . Before calling in an expert however , double check any settings or controls located within or around your appliance as they may have become inadvertently adjusted over time leading up to this incident . With any luck , one of these suggestions should help resolve any issues with why your fridge is making unwanted noises !
