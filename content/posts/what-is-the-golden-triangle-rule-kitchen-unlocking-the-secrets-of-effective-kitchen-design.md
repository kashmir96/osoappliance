## Unlocking the Secrets of the Golden Triangle Rule Kitchen

The 'Golden Triangle Rule' is an important concept in the field of kitchen remodeling and design. It refers to the idea that all three main components of a kitchen - the stove, sink, and refrigerator - should be placed in a triangular formation in order to allow for the most efficient use of space. This important concept ensures that working in the kitchen can be a breeze; but how has it been adopted and refined over the years?

The Golden Triangle Rule has been around for some time now and has been used by kitchen designers and remodelers for many years. It was first formalized by architect Ernest de Vere Cole in his book "Designing the Kitchen-Living Room", which was published in 1938. The idea behind the rule is that, ideally, no task should require a person to move more than 3 steps (or 6 feet) away from the area they are working in, thus creating the kitchen triangle. 

As kitchen spaces have continued to evolve over the years, this concept has remained intact with it being incorporated in various ways by both new and experienced designers. This could be through adjusting the size and shape of the triangle as well as more intricate uses such as testing the equivalence and speed between two items, or using an elevation plan to layout and design the working triangle. 

No matter how the Golden Triangle Rule is used, the main takeaway is that by understanding the concept and its fundamentals, it can be used to ensure that kitchen design remains efficient and effective â€” making the process of working in the kitchen much easier for everybody.
