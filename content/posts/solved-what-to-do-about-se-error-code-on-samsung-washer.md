## Figuring Out the Samsung Washer SE Error Code 

Having an error code display on any washer can be an alarming sight. It can cause unnecessary worry and stress when we're unable to identify the issue. This article will discuss what an SE error code is typically associated with when it appears on a Samsung washer and how to fix it. 

When you see an SE code appear on the LCD display of a Samsung washer, it typically indicates that either the water level is too high or the pressure sensor is not working correctly. There are several troubleshooting steps that should be taken when this code appears. 

First, you must unplug the washer from the power source. After this is done, the pressure sensor should be first checked for any problems. This part can often be located near the bottom of the washer tub. If the pressure sensor is found to be working properly, the water levels should next be checked. If the water levels are too high, the drain hose must be disconnected, and the excessive water must be pumped out.

Finally, after completing all the steps above, plug the washer back in and turn it back on. After a few minutes on the start cycle, the washer should begin running again. If the SE code is still displaying after going through the suggested solutions, then it might be time to call a technician and have them inspect the washer.
