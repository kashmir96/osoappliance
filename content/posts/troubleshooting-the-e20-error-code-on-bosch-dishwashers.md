## How to Resolve Common Issues With Bosch Dishwashers
One of the most common dishwasher issues faced by Bosch users is the e20 error code. This error code can often occur when the dishwasher is being used, causing frustration and headache for Bosch dishwasher owners. To help resolve this issue, this article will explain the common causes of the e20 error code as well as how to troubleshoot and fix this common issue. 

The e20 error code is caused by a blocked or clogged drain. This can be a result of waste or food particles that have become stuck in the drain hose, or when an object or utensil has been accidentally placed in the drain hose. As a result, this blocks the water from the dishwasher from draining properly and the e20 error code is indicated. 

Fortunately, troubleshooting and fixing this issue can be done without involving a professional. The first step is to disconnect the dishwasher from power and from the water supply. Afterwards, check the drain pump and drain hose for any foreign objects blocking the water from draining. If there is an object that is blocking the flow of water, remove it and check if this resolves the issue. 

In cases where the e20 error code is still present, it is recommended that the dishwasher be cleaned manually. To do this, remove the lower spray arm and any visible debris that may have built up. Then, use a soft brush and warm soapy water to clean all the various crevices and components of the dishwasher. Finally, rinse the interior with warm water to ensure all debris has been removed. 

Although the e20 error code is a common issue for Bosch dishwashers, it can be resolved with a few simple steps. By disconnecting the power, checking the drain pump and drain hose and doing a manual clean, you can easily troubleshoot and resolve this common issue. If however, after trying these steps, you're still experiencing this issue, it is recommended that you consult with a professional appliance repair technician to help resolve the issue.
