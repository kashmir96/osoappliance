## Identifying & Resolving Common Issues with Fisher & Paykel Dryers

Fisher & Paykel dryers are becoming a popular choice among many households, thanks to their range of features, reliable performance, and the availability of spare parts. However, even with the best of care, these dryers can sometimes develop a range of faults that can affect the way they operate. Learning how to identify and fix common faults with Fisher & Paykel dryers can be an invaluable skill for any homeowner.

The first step in resolving any issue with a Fisher & Paykel dryer is to identify the source of the problem. This can include anything from problems with the drum not spinning, faulty thermostats, worn out belts, and more. By understanding the source of the issue, it will make it easier to determine the necessary solution.

If there is an issue with the dryer drum not spinning, it is important to check for any possible obstructions in the venting system. If the obstruction is cleared, you should ensure that the lint filter is cleaned, and then check to see if the drum is spinning properly.

If the thermostat appears to be at fault, it is vital to check and make sure that it is properly connected to the main power supply. If it is not connected properly, it may need to be reset or reset by an appliance repair technician.

Another common issue with Fisher & Paykel dryers is the issue of a worn out belt, which can cause the drum to become unbalanced and vibrate. A damaged belt should be replaced with an OEM belt, which is found in the product manual. It is important to take care when removing and replacing the old belt, as the unit must be disconnected from the main power supply before doing so.

No matter what the fault is with your Fisher & Paykel dryer, it is important to identify the problem, before attempting any repairs. To help with this, it is a good idea to seek out the assistance of a qualified appliance repair technician.
