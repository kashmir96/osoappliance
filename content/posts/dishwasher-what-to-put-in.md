If you’re a first-time dishwasher owner, you may be wondering what you can and can’t put in your dishwasher. The truth is, almost anything that can fit in your dishwasher can be washed in it, as long as it’s dishwasher-safe.

Most dishes, silverware, and glassware are safe to put in the dishwasher, as well as plastic containers, cutting boards, and some cookware. When in doubt, check the item for a dishwasher-safe symbol or look for the manufacturer’s care instructions.

However, there are some items that you should never put in the dishwasher. Anything made of wood, such as wooden cutting boards, should be washed by hand to avoid warping or cracking. Delicate items like crystal glasses, fine china, and antiques should also be washed by hand.

Also, be aware that some items can be washed in the dishwasher but may not come out as clean as you’d like. Items with a lot of baked-on food, such as pots and pans, may require pre-soaking or hand scrubbing before they go in the dishwasher.

In general, it’s best to double-check the care instructions for any item before putting it in the dishwasher. If you’re still not sure, it’s better to err on the side of caution and wash the item by hand.
