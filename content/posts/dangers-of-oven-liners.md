Oven liners are widely used in cooking, as they can help catch food and liquids that otherwise may drip onto the bottom of the oven and cause a mess. However, what many people don’t realize is that these liners can be potentially dangerous.

First of all, most oven liners are made out of foil or other thin metals that can easily tear or become misshapen when exposed to heat. If this happens, small pieces of metal may break off and get mixed in with your food. In some cases, these tiny pieces may even end up stuck in your throat or digestive tract, leading to serious medical problems. 

In addition to becoming misshapen due to excessive heat exposure, many oven liners are highly flammable. This means that if there is any grease or oil on them while they’re in the oven, it could catch on fire and cause a major fire hazard. To make matters worse, since most oven liners are thin and easily torn apart by heat, flames can quickly spread from one liner to another if multiple are being used at once. 

Finally, some types of oven liners contain harmful chemicals such as Teflon or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). These chemicals can emit toxic fumes when heated up at high temperatures which could be inhaled by anyone nearby— resulting in serious health problems ranging from headaches to respiratory issues. 

Overall, while using an oven liner can be convenient for catching spills and keeping your oven clean— it should always be done with caution and care as it comes with potentially dangerous risks associated with its use!
