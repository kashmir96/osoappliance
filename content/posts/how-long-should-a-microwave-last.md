# How long should a microwave last

A microwave is an essential appliance in your kitchen, and it’s important to know how long it should last. In general, the lifespan of a microwave typically ranges from 8-10 years. However, this can vary depending on the brand and model of your microwave, as well as how often you use it. 

To make sure your microwave is running efficiently and lasting longer, there are a few things you can do: 

1. Clean regularly: Cleaning your microwave regularly helps keep the interior free of food splatters and grease buildup that could reduce its efficiency over time. This is especially important if you’re using the oven for cooking food that tends to splatter or boil over easily (such as pasta). 

2. Avoid overheating: Overheating your food in the microwave could cause damage to the internal components like coils and other wiring. To avoid this, never leave your food unattended in the oven for a prolonged period of time – especially fatty foods like bacon or sausages – as they have a tendency to quickly overheat if left too long! 

3. Keep vents clear: Make sure nothing is blocking any vents on or around your oven. This will help maintain proper airflow which keeps it running more efficiently, increasing its lifespan overall. 

4. Upgrade when necessary: If you notice any performance issues with your current oven then don’t be afraid to upgrade! A new model may come with updated features that will last longer than previous ones – plus they may even save energy costs down the line! 

Overall, with proper care and maintenance you can expect a good quality microwave to last around 8-10 years of regular usage before needing replacement or repair work done on it – but following these tips can help yours stay running even longer!
