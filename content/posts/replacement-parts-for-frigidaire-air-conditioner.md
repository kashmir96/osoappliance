When it comes to air conditioners, Frigidaire is a popular brand. They offer a variety of models and sizes, so you can find one that fits your needs. If you have an older model or need to replace a part on your Frigidaire air conditioner, there are several replacement parts available.

The first type of part you may need to replace is the filter. The filter helps keep dust, pollen and other particles from entering the unit and clogging up the coils or other components. It also keeps dirt from collecting in the blower fan and causing wear on it over time. Depending on your model, this could be either a disposable filter or a reusable washable one. Replacement filters for Frigidaire air conditioners can be found online or at home improvement stores.

Another common replacement part for Frigidaire air conditioners is the evaporator coil. This component helps turn warm air into cool air by absorbing heat from inside your home and transferring it outdoors via refrigerant lines. If your evaporator coil becomes damaged due to corrosion or age, then you will need to replace it with an appropriate size coil that matches your system’s specifications. Replacement coils can be purchased online as well as through select home improvement stores like Lowe’s and Home Depot.

Finally, if you need to replace any of the electrical components like relays or switches in your Frigidaire AC unit then these are easily found at most major electronics stores such as Best Buy or Walmart. Make sure that whatever electrical component you purchase matches up with the existing wiring in order for it work properly with no risk of electrocution! 

Overall, there are several different types of replacement parts available for Frigidaire air conditioners so make sure to research what type fits your exact model before purchasing any items online or at local stores!
