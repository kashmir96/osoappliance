Dryer sheets are a great addition to any laundry routine, and they’re especially popular in New Zealand. They help reduce static cling, soften clothes, and even add a pleasant scent. Here’s a quick look at what dryer sheets are, how they work, and why you should consider using them in your laundry routine.

So what exactly are dryer sheets? Dryer sheets are thin pieces of fabric that you place inside your dryer along with your wet clothes. As the heat from the dryer circulates around the sheet, it releases chemicals that can help reduce static cling and soften fabrics. The scent from the sheet is also released during this process to give your clothes a pleasant smell.

How do dryer sheets work? The chemicals released by the sheet act as positive ions that bond with negative particles on fabric surfaces to neutralize static electricity and reduce static cling. The softening agents in the sheet also help relax fabric fibers which makes clothing softer after washing and drying. Finally, fragrances in the sheet provide an additional layer of freshness when your laundry is finished drying.

Why should you use them? Dryer sheets can be particularly helpful if you live in an area with hard water or if you use low heat settings when drying clothes (which can increase static). They can also be used to add extra scent to freshly washed items or reduce wrinkles on delicates like lingerie or silk items. Additionally, many people find that using a dryer sheet instead of liquid fabric softener helps keep their lint filter clean for longer periods of time! 

Using dryer sheets is easy! Simply add one new sheet into each load before running it through the wash cycle – as long as it’s not too full (otherwise there won’t be enough room for air circulation). Then transfer all items into your tumble-dry cycle – make sure not to overload again! Now just turn on the machine and let it do its thing! When finished drying remove all items promptly so wrinkles don’t set in - then enjoy smelling like fresh linen!
