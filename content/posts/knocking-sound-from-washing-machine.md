# Knocking sound from washing machine

If you own a washing machine, you’ve probably heard a strange knocking sound coming from it at some point. This sound is caused by an imbalance in the washer’s drum, which can be caused by a variety of reasons. Fortunately, this issue is usually easy to fix and doesn’t require any major repairs.

The most common cause of a knocking sound from your washing machine is an unbalanced load. If the clothes in the drum are unevenly distributed, the drum will spin unevenly and cause the knocking noise. To fix this issue, simply redistribute the clothes evenly around the drum before restarting your wash cycle.

Another possible cause of a knocking noise is worn out or damaged suspension rods or shock absorbers. These components help keep your washer balanced during its spin cycle and can wear out over time due to normal wear and tear. If you suspect this is the case with your washer, you should contact a professional repair service to replace these components as soon as possible.

Finally, if your washing machine has been moved recently or installed on an uneven floor surface, it may be causing an imbalance in its spin cycle that leads to a knocking noise. To fix this issue, try adjusting the feet on your washer until it is level with the floor surface before restarting your wash cycle.

In short, if you hear a knocking noise coming from your washing machine it could be caused by an unbalanced load, worn out suspension rods or shock absorbers, or an uneven floor surface. Fortunately, all of these issues are easy to fix and don’t require any major repairs!
