## Learning the Proper Pronunciation of the Word "Laundromat"
Want to learn how to say "Laundromat" correctly? Good news! Pronouncing "Laundromat" is actually quite simple compared to some vowel pronunciations — in fact you only need to know one syllable. 

An easy way to remember the correct way to pronounce this word is to break it into two shorter parts: the phrase “laundry-mat”. When spoken, the two elements are blended together and sound like the single word “Laundromat”. 

It’s important to remember that the “a” in “Laundromat” is pronounced like the “a” in “mat” rather than the “a” in “man” or “mate”. Additionally, it is stressed syllable, so you should emphasize it a little more as you’re saying it. 

When need used in a sentence, the word “laundromat” should have the same intonation as the other words in the phrase, like in the example: “I’m going to the laundromat to do my laundry.” 

So the next time you need to use the word “laundromat”, you can confidently pronounce it correctly. And if you’re ever in need of an appliance to use in your own laundry room at home, be sure to check out our [List of Appliance Rental Companies](./pages/appliance-rental) to find an option that works for you.
