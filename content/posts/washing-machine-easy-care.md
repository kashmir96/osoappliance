Are you tired of dealing with laundry stains and odor? Washing your clothes with the Easy Care cycle on your washing machine could help. The Easy Care cycle is a special setting designed to simplify the process of washing delicate fabrics, such as silks and woolens. This mode helps keep these clothes looking and feeling their best for longer. 

When you start a load in this mode, it will first begin by pre-treating any stains or spots on the clothing before it goes into the main wash cycle. It does this by releasing an extra dose of detergent into the water to help break down these hard-to-remove blemishes. The washer will also use a gentle agitation setting to minimize fabric damage during this stage. 

After pre-treatment, the Easy Care cycle begins its main wash cycle with cool water to avoid shrinkage or discoloration of fabrics like silk or wool. It uses less detergent than a regular wash cycle, which can help extend the life of your clothes by preventing fading and premature wear caused by overwashing them. The washer also runs at low spin speeds during this part, so that garments don’t become too tangled during spinning – another common cause of damage. 

Finally, when it’s time for rinsing, the Easy Care mode uses more water than regular cycles to better remove soap residue from fabrics that can lead to pilling or rough patches over time if not properly washed away. After rinsing is complete, your garments are given an extra spin at low speed for wringing out excess water before being ready for drying! 

The Easy Care mode is perfect for those who want their delicate fabrics looking new for longer without having to worry about damaging them in traditional wash cycles with higher temperatures and harsher conditions that can take their toll over time. So if you have silks or woolens in your wardrobe that could benefit from some extra TLC while still getting them clean – give your washing machine’s easy care cycle a try!
