## How Can I Tell if My Heat Pump is Working? 
Maintaining the health and condition of your household appliances is essential for them to perform to their highest potential. Heat pumps are no exception and it is important to check in on them regularly to make sure they are performing properly. Knowing how to tell if your heat pump is working will give you peace of mind, energy savings, and extend the lifespan of your appliance.

The easiest way to check if your heat pump is working and running properly is by listening to it. Listen to the outdoor unit while it is running and you should hear a soft humming noise with minimal vibration. Another good way to check the health of your heat pump is to measure the airflow. Do this by placing a hand near an air outlet, such as an air grill or register. If you feel air coming out, then your heat pump is properly working. 

You can also check for air temperature. When the heat pump is functioning correctly, the outside air is colder than the air inside. Acting as an air conditioner in summer, the room should cool down when the heat pump is running. Lastly, to ensure that your heat pump is doing its job as efficiently as possible, it is recommended to check for the filter once a month. Clean the filter with a vacuum or a mild detergent and water solution, then leave it to dry completely.

It is important to ensure that your heat pump is working properly so that you get the most out of it.
