# Washing machine keeps spinning

If your washing machine keeps spinning, it can be a sign that something is wrong with the appliance. There are several possible causes for this issue, and it’s important to identify and address them in order to keep your washer running smoothly.

The most common cause of a washing machine that keeps spinning is an unbalanced load. If you have too many clothes in the drum or they are not evenly distributed, the machine can become off-balance and continue to spin even after the cycle is complete. To fix this problem, redistribute the load so that it’s balanced and then restart the cycle.

Another possible cause of a washer that won’t stop spinning is a faulty lid switch. This switch tells the machine when the lid is closed so it knows when to start and stop spinning. If this switch isn’t working properly, your washer may continue to spin even after you’ve opened the lid. To fix this issue, you will need to replace the lid switch with a new one.

Finally, if your washing machine keeps spinning even after you’ve checked for an unbalanced load and replaced any faulty parts, it could be due to an issue with its motor or drive belt. In this case, you will need to contact a professional repair technician for assistance in diagnosing and fixing the problem. 

No matter what is causing your washing machine to keep spinning, it’s important to address the issue as soon as possible in order to prevent further damage or malfunctions from occurring.
