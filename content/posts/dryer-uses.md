Are you looking for ways to get more out of your dryer? It’s a great appliance to have around the house, and it can be used for more than just drying clothes. Here are some creative dryer uses that you may not have considered.

1. Freshen Up Your Shoes - If your shoes are starting to smell, put them in the dryer for a few minutes on the air-only cycle. The hot air will help to eliminate any odors.

2. Revive Stuffed Animals - If your child’s stuffed animals are looking a bit worse for wear, put them in the dryer on the air-only cycle for a few minutes. The heat will help to fluff them up and make them look like new.

3. Kill Dust Mites - Dust mites are microscopic bugs that can cause allergies. To get rid of them, put a few towels or sheets in the dryer on the highest heat setting for about 30 minutes. The heat will kill the dust mites.

4. Soften Towels - If your towels are feeling a bit stiff, put them in the dryer on the air-only cycle for a few minutes. The hot air will help to soften them up.

5. De-Wrinkle Clothing - If you’re in a hurry and don’t have time to iron your clothes, you can put them in the dryer on the air-only cycle for a few minutes. The hot air will help to reduce wrinkles.

6. De-Fuzz Clothing - If your clothes are starting to look a bit fuzzy, put them in the dryer on the air-only cycle for a few minutes. The heat will help to remove the lint and fuzz.

7. Make Play Dough - You can make your own play dough in the dryer. Just mix together 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of salt, 1/2 cup of water, and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Put the mixture in a sealed container in the dryer on the air-only cycle for 10-15 minutes. The heat will help to cook the dough.

These are just a few of the creative dryer uses that you can try. With a little bit of imagination, you can find even more ways to get more out of your dryer.
