The modern washing machine has come a long way since its invention more than a century ago. A lot of time, effort and money have gone into developing new designs that make the process of doing laundry easier, faster and more efficient.

One example of this is the front load washing machine. As opposed to top loading machines, these are designed so that you can load dirty clothes directly into the drum from the front instead of having to reach over your head to do so. This makes it much easier to load large loads or heavy items like blankets and towels.

In addition to being more ergonomic, front loading machines are also much more efficient when it comes to water usage. Because they use an impeller instead of an agitator, they require much less water for each wash cycle—as little as 10 gallons for some models. This can really add up over time in terms of cost savings for households with high water bills or those looking for ways to conserve resources.

Another innovation in modern washing machine design is steam technology. Many newer models feature a built-in steam cycle that helps reduce wrinkles in clothes as well as kill bacteria and allergens on delicate fabrics without harsh chemicals or extra effort from users. This feature is especially useful if you suffer from allergies or asthma and want your laundry done with minimal hassle but maximum cleanliness! 

Finally, one of the most important features in modern washing machines is their energy efficiency rating (EER). The higher the EER number on a model, the lower its energy consumption will be when operating at full capacity—so look for Energy Star certified models if you’re looking to save money on monthly electricity bills while doing your part for the environment! 

Overall, today’s washing machine designs have come a long way since their inception and offer many features that make doing laundry easier than ever before—all while helping reduce energy costs and preserving our precious natural resources!
