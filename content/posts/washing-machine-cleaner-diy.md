If you’re looking for a natural and effective way to clean your washing machine without harsh chemicals, a DIY washing machine cleaner is a great option. Using simple ingredients that you likely already have at home, you can easily clean your washer and keep it running smoothly for years.

The first step in making your own DIY washing machine cleaner is to choose the right ingredients. You will need white vinegar, baking soda, and lemon essential oil. White vinegar is a natural disinfectant that helps remove soap residue, mildew, and bacteria from the walls of the washing machine drum. Baking soda helps break down dirt and grime buildup while also absorbing odors. Finally, lemon essential oil adds a pleasant smell while working as an antibacterial agent that further helps to keep your washer clean and fresh smelling.

Once you have all of your ingredients ready to go, it’s time to start cleaning! Begin by pouring two cups of white vinegar into the detergent dispenser of your washer. Run a hot water cycle on the longest setting with no clothes inside—this will help ensure that the vinegar gets circulated throughout the entire drum of the washer. Once this cycle has finished running, sprinkle one cup of baking soda around the sides and bottom of the drum before running another hot water cycle on its longest setting (again with no clothes). This will help further break down any dirt or grime buildup in hard-to-reach places inside your washer drum. Finally, add 10-15 drops of lemon essential oil onto a washcloth or sponge before wiping down the outside surface area—including knobs and buttons—of your washing machine with this cloth/sponge combo (you don’t want any essential oils getting directly into wash cycles).

By following these steps using natural ingredients like white vinegar, baking soda, and lemon essential oil for an easy DIY cleaning solution for your washing machine can save you money while also keeping it running smoothly for many years! With regular maintenance using this method every few months (or as needed), you should notice less build up in hard-to-reach areas inside the drum as well as better smelling laundry coming out after each load!
