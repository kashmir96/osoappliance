## Get Fast Help for Your Tumble Dryer with This Guide
Getting help for a broken tumble dryer can be tricky and time consuming. Fortunately, this guide offers a quick fix by providing tips and advice on how to get it collected. From professionals to online services, we'll explore all the service options available. Finally, we'll provide a link to find a qualified appliance repair technician in Christchurch.

If your tumble dryer has stopped working, it's important to act quickly. It's especially important if it's a gas-powered model, as it can present a safety hazard if not serviced promptly. Therefore, it's best to contact a professional to examine the appliance. The professional can either fix the problem or arrange collection. 

First check if the tumble dryer is under warranty. If it is, contact the manufacturer or supplier and they should arrange collection. Usually, they will send a qualified engineer to repair your appliance or take it away for repair in the workshop. 

You can also contact an independent appliance repair technician. These are the professionals you can find in our [Appliance Repair Directory - Christchurch](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians/new-zealand/christchurch).

Going online to find appliance repair services can be a great option as well. This can provide a cost effective solution with often same day or next day service. Just make sure to check the reviews and also ask for proof of qualification and insurance. 

Finally, before you pick a service provider, it’s important to check the terms and conditions of the repair service. This includes checking if they offer a money back guarantee, if they offer any free collection/delivery service and so on.
