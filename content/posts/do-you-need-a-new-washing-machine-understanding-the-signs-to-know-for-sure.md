## Do You Need a New Washing Machine?

As washing machines are an integral part of keeping household laundry clean and fresh, it can be difficult to determine when it is time to replace an old washing machine with a new one. Here are some helpful signs to look out for which may indicate that it is time to make the switch.

Firstly, if your washing machine is over 8-10 years old, it is likely due for an upgrade. Modern washing machines are much more efficient when compared to older models, and come with a range of useful features such as faster spin speeds and lower water consumption, meaning significant cost savings in the long term.

Another key sign that it may be time to say goodbye to your old machine is persistent error codes. Even with a thorough cleaning, old machines can develop faults and sometimes the costs of repairs and parts replacement can outweigh the cost of a new washing machine. Our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary can help you identify errors and take decisive action on when to repair or replace an old washing machine.

Finally, if your washing machine is no longer able to clean laundry effectively, with results such as clothes not washing properly or whites fading over time, then it may be time to upgrade. New washing machines offer far superior results and can help keep your laundry in great condition for longer.

In summary, if your washing machine is 8-10 years old, or if it is displaying persistent errors, or if it is no longer delivering the desired results, then it could be worth considering a new washing machine. To get the most out of your new appliance, be sure to consult our Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary so you can always take quick action when any errors arise.
