Ovens are a great appliance to have in your home, but like all appliances, they can experience problems over time. The most common oven problems range from minor issues that you can fix yourself to major malfunctions that require the assistance of a professional. Here is a list of some of the common oven problems and what you should do if they occur. 

1) Oven not heating – One of the most common oven problems is that it won’t heat up properly or at all. This could be caused by a number of factors including a blown fuse, an issue with the power supply or even something as simple as an incorrect setting on the thermostat dial. If this happens, it’s best to check for any blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers before trying to adjust the thermostat dial manually. If this doesn’t work, then you may need to call in a professional electrician or repair person to diagnose and fix the issue. 

2) Oven light not working – Another common issue with ovens is when their light stops working. This could be due to an issue with either the bulb itself or with its wiring connections inside the appliance itself. To troubleshoot this problem, first try replacing the bulb and see if that fixes it (make sure you use a bulb specifically designed for use in ovens). If that doesn’t work then you may need to call in an electrician or repair technician who will be able to open up your appliance and investigate further into any potential wiring issues inside it. 

3) Door not closing properly – A third common problem with ovens is when their door won’t close properly due either misalignment issues between its hinges and frame or due to build-up of grease which prevents its seal from forming correctly when closed shut. If this occurs, first try cleaning off any build-up around its hinges and frame before attempting any manual adjustments yourself as these types of repairs should generally only be carried out by qualified technicians who have experience dealing with such repairs safely and effectively. 

4) Faulty temperature control knob – Finally, sometimes even after adjusting temperature settings on your oven using its temperature control knob nothing seems to happen at all (the temperature doesn’t rise/fall). In this case there may be an issue with either faulty wiring connections between your knob and its associated components within your appliance or simply worn out parts which need replacing altogether (i.e., your thermocouple). Again here it would be advisable for safety reasons alone that such repairs are best carried out by experienced professionals rather than attempting them yourself without proper training/knowledge beforehand. 

If you’re experiencing any of the above issues with your oven or any other appliance, it’s best to call in a professional repair technician who will be able to diagnose the problem and find the best solution. Not only will this help save you time and money, but it could also help prevent further damage from occurring to your appliance in the long run.
