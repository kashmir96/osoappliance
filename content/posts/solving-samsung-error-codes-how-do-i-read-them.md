To read Samsung Error codes, it is important to first understand the two main sections of each error code. The first two or three digits denote the type of error, while the last two digits provide a more specific details about the issue.

For instance, a Samsung washer code "nd" is a warning that the door will not open. The first two digits "nd" indicate the type of problem, while the last two digits "00" give more specifics. This code means that the washer door cannot be opened due to washing activity.
