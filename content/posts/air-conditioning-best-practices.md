When it comes to air conditioning, there are many best practices that can help you keep your home comfortable and energy efficient. Here are some of the top tips for getting the most out of your AC system:

1. Change your air filters regularly: Dirty or clogged filters can significantly reduce the efficiency of your AC system. Be sure to change them on a regular basis as recommended by the manufacturer. This will help ensure clean air is being circulated throughout your home and will also help reduce energy costs. 

2. Schedule regular maintenance: A professional should inspect and service your AC system at least once per year to keep it running at its best. This includes cleaning the coils, changing filters, lubricating moving parts, checking pressures and temperatures, tightening electrical connections and more. These routine tasks will help keep everything in good working order and can prevent costly repairs down the line. 

3. Utilize a programmable thermostat: Setting up a programmable thermostat is an excellent way to save money on energy costs while still keeping your home comfortable when you’re there or away from home. You can set specific temperatures for certain times of day or night so that you’re not running the AC continuously when no one is there to benefit from it (or vice versa). 

4. Check for drafts around windows and doors: Make sure all windows and doors are tightly sealed so that no cold air escapes outside or hot air enters inside during warm months– this can significantly increase energy costs if left unchecked! Look for any cracks around frames or gaps between weather-stripping as these are likely culprits that need attention ASAP. 

 5 Install window coverings: Window coverings such as curtains, shutters or blinds can greatly reduce solar heat gain in summer months (and likewise retain heat during colder months). Keep these closed during peak sunlight hours to block out direct sunlight which would otherwise cause an unnecessary spike in temperature indoors– leading to higher cooling demand on your AC unit! 

 Following these simple tips should help make sure that you get the most out of your air conditioning system without breaking the bank! It may seem like a lot at first glance but taking small steps now will pay off in comfort for years down the road!
