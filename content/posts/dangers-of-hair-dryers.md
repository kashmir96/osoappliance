Hair dryers can be a great tool to quickly dry your hair, however they can also be dangerous if used incorrectly. Hair dryers generate a lot of heat and this can cause serious burns or even start fires. Here are some important safety tips you should follow when using a hair dryer:

1. Always use the lowest setting possible and never hold the hair dryer too close to your scalp or skin. The heat from the nozzle of a hair dryer can easily burn your skin, so keep it at least 6 inches away from you at all times. 

2. Make sure that you unplug the hair dryer when it is not in use and store it in an area where children cannot reach it as they could easily get burned if they touch the hot nozzle or cord while playing with it. 

3. Never leave your hairdryer unattended while it is plugged in, as this could create fire hazards if something were to go wrong with the device or an electrical outlet nearby catches on fire due to overloading of electricity supply. 

4. Use only recommended attachments that come with your hairdryer model and never use any other objects such as paper clips or bobby pins to extend its reach as these items may damage the deviceâ€™s internal parts which could cause sparks or electric shocks when using them again next time around. 

5. If you notice any unusual sounds coming from your hairdryer while operating, stop using immediately and have it checked by an electrician before continuing further usage since these sounds might indicate potential issues within its wiring system that needs professional attention for safety purposes . 

Following these tips will help ensure that you stay safe when using a hair dryer and avoid any potential harm caused by misuse of this device!
