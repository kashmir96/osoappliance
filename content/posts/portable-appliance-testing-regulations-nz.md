Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) regulations in New Zealand are designed to ensure electrical safety in the workplace. All businesses are required to comply with these regulations, which determine the testing and maintenance of portable appliances. It is important for business owners to be aware of their obligations under PAT and how it applies to their operations.

The Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 requires all employers to take all practicable steps to ensure the safety of employees while they are at work. This includes assessing the risk of electrical appliances in the workplace and taking steps to reduce any risks identified. Portable appliance testing is one way that employers can meet this obligation as it helps identify any electrical faults or defects in portable appliances, which can then be rectified before they cause a hazard. 

PAT involves visual inspection followed by a functional test using an appropriate device such as an earth leakage tester that measures current leakage from the appliance under test (AUT). The inspector will also check plugs, cables, insulation and general condition for wear or damage that may indicate a potential problem with an appliance. The inspector will then issue a certificate for each AUT stating whether it has passed or failed according to set criteria. 

In order for employers to comply with PAT regulations, businesses must have their portable electrical equipment tested annually by a qualified person who holds a Certificate of Competence issued by WorkSafe NZ or another approved authority such as ECANZ (Electrical Contractors Association New Zealand). Employers must also provide suitable training on the use and care of portable electrical equipment so that staff understand how best to operate them safely. 
 
Ultimately, PAT regulations are designed to protect both employers and employees from potential dangers posed by defective portable appliances in New Zealand workplaces – ensuring everyone’s safety is paramount when dealing with electricity!
