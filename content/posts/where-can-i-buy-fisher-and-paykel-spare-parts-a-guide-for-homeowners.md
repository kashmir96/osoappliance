## Finding Fisher and Paykel Spare Parts - A Guide for Homeowners

When you own an appliance from a trusted brand, like Fisher and Paykel, you expect that their appliances will last a long time and remain reliable. But then one day, you press the power button and nothing happens. Replacing the entire appliance isn't always the answer, at times the problem can be solved simply with a spare part. But if you've ever looked for a spare part online, you know how challenging it can be. 

Fortunately, if you own a Fisher and Paykel appliance, you're in luck. They make it quite easy to find and purchase the spare parts you need to get your appliance back up and running in no time! 

The first thing to do is have your model number handy. This will make it easier to narrow down search results and find the right part. Once you have the model number, you can check out the official Fisher and Paykel website to find spare parts. They have an easy-to-navigate parts search menu so you can input your product type and model number and find the parts you need. 

If you're unable to locate your model number, another option is to call or email the Fisher and Paykel Customer Care department. It's best to have your serial number ready as they may also ask you for that. They can provide assistance and point you in the right direction. 

Finally, you can always contact a local Fisher and Paykel dealer. Many of their authorised service agents offer online spare parts sales, so you can buy the parts needed for your appliance. With more than six hundred authorised service agents across the globe, you'll likely find one close to you. 

With a level of support like this, it's easy to see why Fisher and Paykel is a top-rated brand amongst household appliance owners. To find out more about high quality appliances from Fisher and Paykel, take a look at our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
