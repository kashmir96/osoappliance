A fridge freezer is a very popular appliance in most households. It helps to keep food fresh, and at the same time it also provides cold storage for frozen items like ice cream and frozen dinners. But how does a fridge freezer work? 

The main components of a fridge freezer are the compressor, condenser coils, evaporator coils, expansion valve and the refrigerant. The compressor is responsible for compressing the refrigerant gas which then circulates around the system to remove heat from the inside of your refrigerator or freezer. 

The condenser coils are located outside of your refrigerator or freezer and transfer heat from inside to outside through convection currents. This process causes condensation on the outer sides of these coils that then evaporates away into thin air. 

Inside your refrigerator or freezer is where you’ll find evaporator coils that absorb heat from inside and pass it on to the compressor as hot gas so it can be cooled again by the condenser coil. The expansion valve controls how much refrigerant passes through each side of this cycle depending on how cold you want either side of your unit to be at any given time – giving you complete control over temperature settings in both compartments. 

Finally, when all these components have done their job properly, you should have a nice cool interior in both compartments for optimal food storage conditions!
