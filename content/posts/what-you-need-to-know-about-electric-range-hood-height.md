## Advantages of Setting the Proper Electric Range Hood Height 

When it comes to electric range hoods, setting the proper height is important for a number of reasons. An appropriate ventilation system height can help ensure the maximum efficiency of the system, eliminate airborn contaminants, and create an inviting aesthetic in the kitchen. In this blog post, we'll discuss what range hood heights are most suitable for different types of electric range hoods, so you can make an informed decision when purchasing or installing one in your kitchen.

Electric range hoods come in various sizes, shapes, and designs, each of which requires a specific height to allow air to be drawn in efficiently. When selecting a range hood, it is essential to consider both the type of appliance that will be under it and the distance from the cooking area to the hood. For electric ranges and cookstops, a range hood height that is not more than 30 inches from the cooktop will ensure the greatest level of efficiency and performance.

Some homes have taller ceilings, and for these types of cases, an appropriate range hood height would be between 36 and 40 inches from the cooktop. Installing a range hood at these heights ensures that the ventilation system captures cooking fumes and odours more effectively, and also helps to extend the hoodâ€™s life.

In addition to range hood height, you should also consider the type of material the hood is made of. Different materials can offer different levels of protection, noise reduction, and energy efficiency. Stainless steel is the most popular choice for range hoods, as it is durable and easy to clean, while aluminium is also a popular option due to its ability to hold up well to heat and humidity.

Finally, when installing a range hood, be sure to pay attention to the hood's shape. Curved range hoods better capture and reduce cooking smoke, while straight-sided hoods filter the air more efficiently.

Overall, finding the appropriate electric range hood height is essential to ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of your ventilation system. When shopping for an electric range hood, consider the type of appliance it will be covering, the distance from the cooking area, the material the hood is made of, and its shape to ensure optimal performance.
