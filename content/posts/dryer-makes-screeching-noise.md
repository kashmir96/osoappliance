If you're getting ready to do some laundry and your dryer starts making a screeching noise, it can be frustrating and worrisome. Fortunately, the issue might be something you can fix yourself before calling in a repair technician. Here's what you should know about why your dryer is making a screeching noise, and how to identify and fix the problem.

The most common cause of a dryer making a screeching noise is worn out bearings or rollers. These are located on the rear panel near the motor and drum or behind the front panel of the appliance. As these parts age, they become worn down due to friction from spinning around all day long when in use. This causes them to not spin as smoothly as they should which creates squeaking noises coming from inside your dryer.

Fortunately, this issue is often one that you can take care of yourself without having to call in an expensive repairman. First, make sure that you unplug your dryer before attempting any repairs on it! Then take off the back panel or front access door (depending on where your bearings/rollers are located), so you can get access to them directly. You'll then need some lubricant such as WD-40 or silicone spray lube, cotton swabs or rags, and needle nose pliers (or similar tool). Use these materials to lubricate all moving parts such as bearings/rollers with light oil/lubricant spray—don’t forget about any belt pulleys too! Taking care not to over-oil anything since excess oil may cause more damage than good if left unchecked for too long; using just enough will help reduce friction between components so they move more freely together without creating excessive noise levels during operation time again soon after completing maintenance tasks like this one at home by yourself successfully!

Once everything looks good again inside your dryer—and it's been unplugged throughout—you can now go ahead plugging back up safely with no more worries about annoying loud noises coming out when doing laundry loads every other day anymore soon enough hopefully! If after trying all these steps but still don't work then contact an experienced repair technician who should be able to properly diagnose what else might be wrong with its internal components needing attention next most likely…good luck getting it fixed soon & enjoy quieter washing times ahead once again soon hopefully!
