## What You Should Know About Dometic CFF Error Codes

When you find your Dometic control panel flashing error codes at you, it can be quite a disorienting experience. What exactly do those blinking codes mean? To the untrained eye, error codes can seem like gibberish, but the truth is that they provide powerful insights into what’s happening within your appliance.

In this blog post, we seek to help you understand Dometic’s error codes and provide you with the information you need to help get your appliance up and running again.

Dometic error codes are divided up into general codes and specificcodes. The general codes are divided into categories, the primary being LF and EF. LF stands for “Loss of Function”, and is used to indicate that a component within the device has failed to perform its designated function. EF, on the other hand, is used to signify “Electrical Fault” and identifies a component that has malfunctioned due to an electrical fault.

Specific codes are numeric codes ranging from one to five digits. For example, the code 40-2 indicates that the device has experienced a “Spark Ignition Failure”. Specific codes such as this are typically more complex than general codes, and as such require careful analysis in order to determine the best action to take to resolve the issue.

At this point, it’s important to remember that, when facing a malfunctioning appliance, it should not be taken apart or worked on without the assistance of a professional serviceperson. Attempting to do so could create safety risks and worsen the malfunctioning appliance.
