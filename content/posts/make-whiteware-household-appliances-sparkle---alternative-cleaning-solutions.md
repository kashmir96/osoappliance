## Household Whiteware Appliances - Without the Rigour of Harsh Commercial Cleaners 

Making sure that your appliances are sparkling and bright is not only for aesthetic appeal. Keeping your appliances in good condition can have a marked effect on their effectiveness and efficiency. Traditional cleaning products can be quite harsh on delicate surfaces and can leave streaks that are hard to remove. To make sure your appliances truly shine, there are a number of alternative methods to keep them clean using products that in your own home.

One of the options is using vinegar or citrus products. White vinegar is very good at breaking up grease, fingerprints, and other grime and is also antibacterial, making it perfect for cleaning a range of surfaces within the kitchen. For surfaces like stainless steel you can use a mix of white vinegar and water to make a spray that you can then use to clean the surface. Orange peels are also a great option for cleaning tough stainless steel surfaces because of their high content of natural oils which break down dirt and grease. 

A more “natural” option to use for cleaning appliances is baking soda. Baking soda is a well known product for cleaning, and when mixed with some warm water it is great for surfaces like the inside of refrigerators, or dust and dirt deposits that have collected through normal wear and tear. Baking soda also deodorizes and absorbs moisture, making it a great product for cleaning the inside of a refrigerator or freezer. 

Finally, a product that is very simple to use is a microfiber cloth. Microfiber cleaning cloths are very effective and have a tendency to attract dirt and dust, so it’s great for surfaces that need an even cleaning with no streaks. Microfiber cloths are great for removing dust from electronic appliances and monitors, or for wiping off large kitchen surfaces like counters and tables. 

With the range of products available to use, cleaning your appliances doesn’t have to mean the harsh chemical odors and residue that come with many traditional cleaning products. Alternatives are available for cleaning your whiteware appliances and keeping them shining inside and out.
