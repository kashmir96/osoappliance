## Filtering Out The Best Water Filter Pitchers

When it comes to drinking clean, healthy water, the convenience of having a pitcher-style water filter system can be ideal. With many different models and products on the market, however, it can be difficult to pinpoint the best water filter pitcher for your home. Luckily, there are resources available to make finding the ideal pitcher easier. 

When using customer reviews to narrow down your selection, consider how many stars a product has, and how useful customers have found the features offered by the pitcher. Quality customer reviews should explain actual performance related to the filtration of impurities and levels of hardness within the water. Consider customer reviews that spot all the pros and cons that customers have experienced when using a product. 

In addition to customer reviews, look up independent lab tests to assess the product’s ability to reduce impurities. A great resource to look over is Consumer Reports. Reviews provided by Consumer Reports will give you a scientific view of what the product can reduce from the water and the level of reduction. 

Finally, consider how easy the pitcher is to use and how often you will need to replace the filter. Many pitchers will offer suggested reminder times for when to change the filter, making it easier for you to stay on track and maintain your system. Additionally, pitchers with clear top lids with sealed filters can help reduce spills and messes as you refill. 

Finding the best water filter pitcher for your home does not have to be a daunting task. With quality customer reviews and independent lab tests, you’ll have the information you need to make an informed decision and purchase the ideal pitcher for your needs.
