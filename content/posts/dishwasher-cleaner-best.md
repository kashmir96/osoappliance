If you’re looking to keep your dishwasher running efficiently and effectively, it’s important to follow some best practices when it comes to cleaning it. Here are some tips for keeping your dishwasher clean and running optimally:

1. Clean the Filter: The filter is responsible for catching food particles and other debris. It should be cleaned regularly to ensure that your dishwasher is running properly. To clean the filter, remove it from the dishwasher and rinse it with warm water. If there is any build-up, use a brush to remove it.

2. Use a Dishwasher Cleaner: Regularly using a dishwasher cleaner can help to keep your dishwasher running efficiently. Look for a cleaner that is specifically designed for dishwashers and follow the instructions on the package.

3. Clean the Interior: The interior of the dishwasher should be cleaned periodically to remove any food particles or other debris that may be stuck to the walls or bottom. To do this, use a damp cloth and a mild detergent.

4. Run an Empty Cycle: Running an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner can help to remove any build-up from the interior of the dishwasher. This should be done at least once a month.

5. Clean the Exterior: The exterior of the dishwasher should be wiped down with a damp cloth to remove any dust or dirt. This will help to keep the dishwasher looking its best.

By following these best practices, you can help to ensure that your dishwasher is running efficiently and effectively. Regular cleaning and maintenance will help to extend the life of your dishwasher and keep it running optimally.
