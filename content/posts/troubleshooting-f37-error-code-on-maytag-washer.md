## Troubleshooting Maytag Washer Error Code f37

If your Maytag washing machine has an error code of f37 then it could be indicating that an issue has occurred on the machine and it needs to be addressed. When troubleshooting this error code, it is important to understand what could be causing it, how to test for it, and what the solutions may be, in order to get your washer up and running again.

Before starting any repairs, it is important to unplug the washer and remove any panels or covers to access components like the circuit board and sensors. Any errors related to the machineâ€™s main control board or faulty wiring should be addressed first as these are common causes of the f37 error code. Examine the wiring and connectors to see if there are any loose or damaged connections. If the wiring appears to be fine, then you will need to check if the main control board is having any problems. Be sure to use a multimeter to test for voltage and current readings to ensure the board is functioning correctly.

If the problem is with the control board then it is likely that a replacement is needed. Replacement boards can be purchased from authorized Maytag repair outlets and installed to get your washer back up and running. Once the board is installed correctly, the error code should reset and the machine should start working again.

If the error code is still present after inspecting and replacing the main control board, then it is possible that the pressure switch has a problem or isn't functioning correctly. This will determine the water level and can affect the overall operation of the washer. Using a multimeter to test it is a good idea to determine if the pressure switch is in working order. If not, it will need to be replaced in order to allow the washer to cycle properly.

In any case, if the error code persists even after following the troubleshooting steps outlined above, it is highly recommended that you contact a [professional appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians).
