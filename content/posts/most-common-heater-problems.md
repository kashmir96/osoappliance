If you’re having trouble with your heater, you’re not alone. Heater problems are among the most common issues homeowners face in winter. Fortunately, some of the most common problems can be easily fixed or prevented with a little maintenance and troubleshooting.

One of the most prevalent issues is a lack of heat coming from your heater. This could be caused by an old filter that needs to be replaced, a dirty blower wheel, or even an electrical issue with the thermostat or wiring. If all else fails and you can’t identify the problem on your own, it’s best to call in a professional for help.

Another common issue is strange noises coming from your heater when it starts up or runs for a while. This is usually caused by loose parts that need to be tightened or adjusted, but sometimes it could indicate something more serious like worn-out bearings that need to be replaced. In either case, calling in a technician to take care of it is probably the best option if you don’t have experience working on these types of appliances yourself.

Lastly, pilot light problems are also very common when dealing with heaters. The pilot light operates using an open flame and can easily go out due to air drafts or other factors; this will cause your heater to stop working completely until it’s relit again. If this happens often enough, you may want to consider replacing it with an electronic ignition system instead which uses electricity instead of gas and won't get blown out as easily as a pilot light does over time. 

By being aware of these most common heater problems and taking steps to prevent them before they occur (like regularly changing filters), you can avoid having major issues during winter months and keep yourself warm all season long!
