When it comes to purchasing a microwave, one of the most common questions people have is what size microwave should they buy? After all, there are a variety of sizes available on the market, ranging from small countertop models to large built-in units. To help you make an informed decision, here is an overview of some of the most common microwave sizes and their features. 

The smallest microwaves on the market are usually 0.7 cubic feet or less in size. These tiny microwaves are perfect for dorm rooms and other small spaces where space is at a premium. Some models even come with features like preset cooking buttons and variable power levels to make preparing meals easier. However, these microwaves generally lack additional features like convection cooking capabilities or grilling options since they are so small in size. 

The next step up is 1.0 cubic feet microwaves which offer slightly more space than their smaller counterparts while still being compact enough for those with limited countertop space or areas that need to remain free from clutter. These mid-size models often include additional features such as multiple power levels, auto defrost settings and programmable cooking times for added convenience when preparing food items quickly and easily. 

For larger kitchens and households that require more space for preparing meals, 2 cubic feet or larger microwaves may be necessary in order to accommodate multiple dishes at once without overcrowding the kitchen countertop area. These larger models tend to come with more advanced features such as convection cooking capabilities which allow users to bake cakes and other desserts without having to turn on the oven; reheat settings which can be used for quickly warming up leftovers; plus grilling options that let you brown meats or vegetables right in your microwave! 

No matter what size microwave you decide on purchasing ultimately comes down to personal preference as well as how much countertop space you have available in your kitchen area - but by understanding each of these most common sizes available on todayâ€™s market, hopefully this information has helped make your decision just a bit easier!
