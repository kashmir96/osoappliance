# Free standing vs wall mounted oven

When it comes to choosing a new oven for your kitchen, you’ll likely be presented with two main options: free standing or wall mounted. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it’s important to consider your needs and preferences before making a decision.

Free standing ovens are the most common type of oven and are usually the most affordable option. They are typically installed on the floor, either in a corner or against a wall. The benefit of this type of oven is that it can be easily moved if needed, and they often have more space for cooking than wall mounted models. However, they can take up valuable floor space in smaller kitchens, and they may not be as energy efficient as wall mounted models.

Wall mounted ovens are becoming increasingly popular in modern kitchens due to their sleek design and energy efficiency. These models are typically installed at eye level for easy access, freeing up valuable countertop space below them. They also tend to have larger capacity than free standing models, allowing you to cook more food at once. On the downside, they cannot be moved once installed, so you’ll need to make sure you choose one that fits your kitchen perfectly before committing to purchase. Additionally, they may not fit into all kitchen spaces due to their size requirements.

Ultimately, whether you choose a free standing or wall mounted oven will depend on your individual needs and preferences. If you have limited floor space but plenty of countertop space then a wall mounted model may be the best choice for you; however if you need flexibility then a free standing model might be better suited for your needs. Whichever option you choose make sure that it meets all safety requirements before installation!
