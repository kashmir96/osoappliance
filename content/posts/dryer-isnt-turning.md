If your clothes dryer isn't turning, then you may have a problem that needs to be addressed. Here are some possible causes of why your dryer isn't turning, and what you can do to fix it.

1. The power cord may be unplugged. If the power cord is unplugged, the dryer won't turn on. Check the power cord and make sure it is securely plugged into the wall outlet.

2. The dryer door may not be properly closed. If the door is not completely closed, the dryer won't turn on. Make sure the door is securely closed and latched.

3. The timer may be set to the wrong setting. If the timer is not set to the correct setting, the dryer won't turn on. Check the timer and make sure it is set to the correct setting.

4. The dryer may be overheating. If the dryer is overheating, it will shut off to prevent damage. Check the dryer vents and make sure they are clear of lint and debris. Clean the lint filter and make sure the exhaust duct is not blocked.

5. The motor may be defective. If the motor is not functioning properly, the dryer won't turn on. You may need to replace the motor if this is the case.

If your dryer isn't turning, there may be a simple solution. Check the power cord, door, timer, and motor to see if any of these components are causing the issue. If none of these solutions work, it may be time to call a professional for help.
