## Resetting a LG Washing Machine 
We all know the frustration of dealing with a faulty appliance. Whether it be a washing machine or a refrigerator, if it stops working, you want it to start working again as soon as possible. But what do you do when even after switching it off and on, your LG washing machine still does not seem to be working?

The most common solution to this could be resetting the machine with its reset button. Most washing machines, and especially the LG models, come with a reset button feature that can be accessed by either a direct reset button or a combination of reset and power buttons.

On a LG washing machine you can find the reset button either above the water valve connections on the back of the machine, or near the bottom at the base of the door or on the control panel. It can be a small red or blue button that you have to press. For machines with a combination reset button, you will have to press the reset button along with other buttons like the start or power on the control panel. 

It is important to remember that if the reset button is pressed, it will reset all of your settings on the machine like temperature, spin speed, wash cycle, etc., so make sure to save these manually or press the save settings button on the control interface panel. 

If you have ever faced similar errors with your washing machine and have had to reset it, you may have noticed that different models can have different locations for the reset button. It is hence important to familiarize yourself with the LG model you own and locate the reset button properly before attempting a reset.
