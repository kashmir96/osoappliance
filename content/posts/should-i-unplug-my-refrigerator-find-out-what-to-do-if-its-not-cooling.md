## Should I Unplug My Refrigerator?
Fridge not getting cool? Don't panic! Many people don't know this but unplugging your refrigerator might be a quick fix for cooling problems. 

When a refrigerator is not cooling, the first thing you should do is unplug it for 10 minutes to allow its internal electronic sensors to reset. If the fridge has cycled through several cooling components and is still not cooling, it is time to investigate the difficulty further.

If the fridge is still not cooling after unplugging it, then it is likely due to a faulty cooling component. This could be a condenser fan, a compressor, an evaporator fan, or an electronic control board. To identify which component is causing the cooling trouble, you should refer to the manufacturer’s user guide and troubleshooting guide. Additionally, you can look through our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for further help in diagnosing and resolving the issue.

Before you repair or replace any parts, it is best to make sure that your fridge is properly leveled and its interior is clean and dust-free. Many times when the cooling is not at the desired temperature, a dirty filter or incorrect leveling may be the culprit.

If your troubleshooting ends with no answers, you may consider contacting an appliance technician to help troubleshoot and fix the problem.

If your refrigerator is not cooling, unplugging it is a simple solution to investigate and potentially fix the problem. Furthermore, if you’re having difficulty identifying the faulty component, our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) may be of help.
