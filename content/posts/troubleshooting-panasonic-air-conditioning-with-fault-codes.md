Being the world's no.1 air conditioning brand, Panasonic provides state-of-the-art technologies for a comfortable indoor climate. However, at times, users face difficulties in operating these air conditioners. To help users out of such situations, Panasonic offers troubleshooting using error codes. 

Troubleshooting using error codes is unique as it eliminates unnecessary guesswork or unwanted service calls.
