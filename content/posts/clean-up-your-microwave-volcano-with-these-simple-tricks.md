## Simple Techniques for Eliminating Microwave Messes

Itâ€™s been said that the kitchen is the heart of the home. Unfortunately, an unruly microwave often takes away from that loving atmosphere. Thankfully, with the right tools and techniques in hand, it doesn't have to be that way! Below we provide a few tips to help make cleaning up the occasional microwave mess easier.

One of the best ways to reduce the mess caused by an overzealous microwave is to invest in a few small containers that are microwave-safe. This allows you to cover your food while it's cooking, keeping spills and splatters at bay. A good alternative is to use a large dinner plate or shallow bowl to do the same. 

If there is a bit of a mess, never fear! Most microwaves have removable shelves and turntables that can be taken out for easy cleaning. Lucky for you, dish soap or a multi-surface cleaner and a damp sponge should do the trick! It is important to remember not to use metal scrubbers, however, as these can scratch and damage the appliance. 

Finally, no matter what you do, be sure to unplug your microwave before attempting any major cleaning. Not only is this a safety precaution, it will also help to keep the appliance running smoothly and prevent any damage to the interior. 

Cleaning a messy microwave doesn't have to be intimidating. With the right tools and a little bit of elbow grease, you can get it spic and span in no time!

##Clean Up Your Microwave Volcano

Q1: How can I prevent a volcano from forming in my microwave?

A1: To avoid a volcano forming in your microwave, make sure you always use lower power settings and watch food while it's heating. Additionally, don't overfill the microwave with food, as it can lead to splattering.

Q2: What can I do after a volcano has formed in my microwave? 

A2: If a volcano has already formed in your microwave, turn off the power and unplug the appliance. Take a clean damp cloth and wipe down all of the inside surfaces and shelves, being careful with sharp objects like splattered glass or metal. Once the interior of the microwave is clean, create a steam bath in the appliance to help soften any stuck-on food particles. Fill a microwave-safe bowl with one to two cups of water and heat it in the microwave for two to three minutes. Carefully remove the bowl, use a soft cloth to scrub the remaining bits of food, and dry the oven with a clean cloth.

Q3: Are cleaning products necessary to remove a microwave volcano?

A3: It's not necessary to use cleaning products to remove a microwave volcano. You can clean it with warm water, a clean cloth and some elbow grease. However, if you prefer to use a cleaning product, choose a non-abrasive soap or mild cleaner.

Q4: How can I freshen up the smell of my microwave after cleaning a volcano?

A4: After cleaning your microwave, you can help freshen up the smell by simply heating a bowl of lemon slices for about a minute and a half. The lemon will also help to remove any grease or grime left behind after the cleaning.

Q5: How often should I clean my microwave to prevent a volcano from forming?

A5: It's important to keep your microwave clean on a regular basis in order to prevent a volcano from forming. Wipe the interior down at least once a week with a damp cloth and warm soapy water. Additionally, give the interior an occasional steam bath to help prevent stuck-on food particles.
