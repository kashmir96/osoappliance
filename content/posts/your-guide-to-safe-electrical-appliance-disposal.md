## How to Safely Dispose of Electrical Appliances

Are you considering disposing of an old electrical appliance? For a myriad of reasons - from saving energy to avoiding appliance repair costs - more and more people are looking to replace their familiar appliances with more efficient models, but disposing of electrical appliances safely and responsibly is essential in order to protect your health and the environment. In this blog, we'll explain how.

To start, safety is key in all aspects of disposing of electrical appliances. Double-check that all power has been disconnected from an appliance before maintenance or disposal, and for safety’s sake, and when possible, it is always advised to call up a professional appliance repair technician to safely disconnect the power sources in older appliances.

Once you’ve ensured the appliance is fully disconnected, it is important to determine if the appliance contains refrigerant before disposal. Refrigerators, room air conditioners, and dehumidifiers all contain refrigerant, and it is against federal rules to vent this refrigerant into the air when disposing of these appliances. Your local retailer, scrap metal yard, or appliance repair service can properly remove these refrigerants before disposal.

It is also important to think of the environment when disposing of electrical appliances. Make sure to recycle any hazardous materials or metals used during production of the appliance. The outer cabinets or other non-metal components of the appliance can usually be recycled as well. To maximize energy savings, many communities have joined together across the United States to create recyclable electrical appliance collections. 

Whether you're looking to replace an old appliance or simply seeking to discard it, planning a responsible and safe disposal can ultimately help make the world a better place.

## Disposing of Electrical Appliances Safely 

**What are my disposal options for electrical appliances?** 

You have three main options for disposing of electrical appliances: recycling, reusing, or responsibly disposing. For recycling, you can take your electronic appliance to a local e-waste recycler or find an appropriate collection site for your area. Sometimes, manufacturers or retailers will provide convenient mail-in or drop-off options for consumers. Reusing is another great way to reduce waste by giving the appliance a second life by donating it to charities, schools, or even giving it away online to a person who may be able to put it use. If all else fails and the appliance can no longer be reused, you should properly dispose of it through a hazardous materials collection facility to ensure that it is disposed of safely and with the least possible environmental impact.

**What types of electrical appliances can be recycled?**

Almost all types of electrical appliances are eligible for recycling. Examples of commonly recycled electrical appliances include computers, laptops, monitors, keyboards, printers, scanners, cell phones, televisions, and microwaves.

**What happens to recycled electrical appliances?**

Recycled electrical appliances are taken apart and separated into different materials. These materials are then reused and repurposed in different industries. For example, plastics, metals, and glass are all commonly recycled materials that are used in the manufacturing of other products.

**What should I do with my old refrigerator?**

Many retailers and states have special collections for old refrigerators and other large appliances. Check with your local waste management or recycling office to find out what your options are. Newer refrigerators often have special safety features that need to be removed and recycled separately.

**Are there any safety precautions to consider before disposing of an electrical appliance?**

Yes. Be sure to unplug the appliance from the power source and defrost any freezers before disposing of it. Additionally, if your appliance includes any batteries, be sure to remove them and recycle them separately. For larger appliances, make sure to remove the doors and any locks to prevent the risk of children becoming trapped inside.
