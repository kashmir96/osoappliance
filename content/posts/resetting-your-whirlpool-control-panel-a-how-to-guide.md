The Whirlpool Control Panel can be a great way to keep track of the proper operation of your home appliances. However, unexpected glitches or malfunctions in the system can happen, and you may need to reset the panel. Resetting your Whirlpool Control Panel is easy once you know the correct procedure.

First, turn off the power to the appliance the Panel is connected to. This should be done by simply unplugging the appliance from the wall socket or switching off the circuit breaker.
