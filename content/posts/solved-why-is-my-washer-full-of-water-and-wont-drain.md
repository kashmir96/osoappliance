## Reasons Why Your Washer Is Full of Water and Won't Drain
Are you frustrated that you’re stuck with a washer full of water and nothing is draining? This is a common problem that can have several causes. Here are a few possible issues and steps you can take to resolve the issue.

#### Clogged Drain Hose
This is the most common cause of washers that are full of water and won’t drain. Check the drain hose and make sure there is no clog. If it is clogged, use a long, flexible hose with a sink attachment to clear away the blockage.

#### No Power to Washer
If your washer is receiving no power, it will not be able to drain water. Check the power cord and circuit breaker to make sure the power is on. If it’s not on, try resetting the power supply and check for any loose or unplugged wires.

#### Pump Is Malfunctioning 
If the power is on and the drain hose is clear, the problem may be the pump. If the washer’s pump is malfunctioning, it won’t be able to drain the water. The best way to solve this issue is to have a professional inspect the pump and repair it accordingly.
