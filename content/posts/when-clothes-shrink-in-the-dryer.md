If you’ve ever had clothes shrink in the dryer, you know how frustrating it can be. Unfortunately, it’s a common problem that many of us have experienced at one point or another. So, why do our clothes shrink in the dryer?

The most common reason is due to high temperatures. When exposed to high temperatures, fabrics such as cotton, wool and even synthetic fibers can shrink. This is because the heat causes the fibers to contract and become tighter. Every fabric has a different temperature threshold that must not be exceeded in order for it not to shrink; for example, wool should never be dried at temperatures higher than 140°F (60°C).

Another possible cause of shrinking is over-drying. This happens when clothes are left in the dryer for too long, which causes them to become overly dry and brittle. As a result, they may become stiffer and smaller than they were before being placed in the dryer. To avoid this problem, make sure to follow care instructions on your clothing labels or set your dryer timer accordingly so that your clothes don’t stay in the machine for too long. 
 
Finally, improper washing can also lead to shrunken clothing. Using hot water when washing delicate fabrics such as silk or rayon can cause them to shrink when placed in the dryer later on down the line. To prevent this from happening, make sure you always use cold water when laundering these types of garments and opt for air-drying whenever possible. 

In conclusion, there are several reasons why our clothes may shrink in the dryer – from using high temperatures during drying cycles to improper washing practices – but thankfully there are ways to avoid this issue altogether! By following care instructions on clothing labels and setting your dryer timer accordingly (or air-drying whenever possible) you can help ensure that your favorite garments stay looking good for years to come!
