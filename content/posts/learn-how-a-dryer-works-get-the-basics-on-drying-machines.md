## Get the Basics on How a Dryer Works
Modern day dryers are an essential household appliance used to quickly and efficiently dry clothing, bed-linen and other fabric items. Here's a basic overview on how a dryer works so you can decide for yourself if its the right appliance for you. 

Inside the dryer there is a large drum that turns, in which the clothes are tumbled in the heated air. A motor and belt or drive-shaft connects the drum to the outside of the dryer, giving it the spinning motion. A gas or electric powered heating element helps to keep the air temperature at the right level for drying and the air circulates through the dryer with the help of a fan. 

The air is sucked into the dryer, passes through the heat source, and is then funneled into the drum, and the clothing. The circulation of hot air makes the second, inner wall of the drum hot, while the outside of the drum remains cool. This helps to prevent the clothing from burning. The damp air that is released is then cycled through a lint filter and exits outside, or is re-circulated back into the room.

The dryer senses the level of humidity within the drum and will shorten or lengthen the drying cycle as required. Many modern dryers also come with additional features, such as timed drying, fast-dry, and eco-drying. This helps to make the appliance even more energy efficient making it economical and environmentally friendly.

Dryers are an essential appliance for many households and their ability to quickly dry clothes and bedding is almost invaluable. With the variety of features and settings they come with, they are highly accessible and easy to use.
