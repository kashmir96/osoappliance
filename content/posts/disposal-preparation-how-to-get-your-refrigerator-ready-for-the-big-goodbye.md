## Preparing Your Refrigerator for Disposal
Saying goodbye to an old trusty appliance like a refrigerator can be sad, but getting organized for the actual disposal can help make it easier. If you’re planning on replacing an aging refrigerator, then preparing it properly for disposal will ensure it’s disposed of responsibly with the least amount of effort. 

First, make sure the refrigerator is totally empty. Take out any food, and remove the shelves, wire racks, and crisper drawers. Depending on the age of your fridge, it may also have an icemaker and/or water filter built in. These should be disconnected and removed as well. 

Then you’ll want to thoroughly clean the refrigerator. Start with an all-purpose cleaner, and make sure to scrub away any food residue. If the shelving or other components of the fridge seem too difficult to scrub clean, then you can throw those items in a garbage bag and get rid of them. 

If the fridge contains a light bulb, then that should be removed as well. For refrigerators with Freon-based cooling systems, it’s a good idea to take it to a specialized refrigeration company for further preparation, as there are special procedures for disposing of Freon-based materials responsibly. 

Finally, once the fridge is empty and clean, put a sign on it that says “ready for pick up” and contact your local waste management provider to make arrangements for the refrigerator to be picked up and disposed of. 

Getting your refrigerator ready for disposal can be tedious and time consuming, but it’s the right thing to do. After getting rid of your old fridge, take a look at our [Overview of Top Appliances] to find the right new replacement for your home.
