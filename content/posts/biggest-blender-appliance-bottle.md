Blenders are one of the most used kitchen appliances in modern households. From blending smoothies and shakes to pureeing soups and sauces, blenders can do it all. However, despite their convenience, blenders can be prone to certain bottle-necks that can hinder their performance. Here are some of the biggest blender appliance bottle-necks you should be aware of:

1. Motor Overheating: Most blenders have motors that are designed to run at high speeds for extended periods of time without overheating. However, if the motor is overworked or used too frequently, it can start to overheat and cause major problems with your blenderâ€™s performance. If you notice your blender's motor running hot or making strange noises while in use, it may be time for a replacement motor. 

2. Blender Jar Size: The size of a blender jar is an important factor in determining its effectiveness when blending large batches or thick ingredients like nuts and ice cubes. If your blender jar is too small for what you're trying to blend, it will take longer for everything to get blended properly and your finished product won't have a consistent texture or taste. Investing in a larger blender jar will help ensure that all ingredients get blended quickly and completely each time you use your machine! 

3 .Lack Of Power: Blender power is measured in watts which determines how fast they can spin blades within their jars when blending ingredients together into liquid form. If you find yourself having trouble getting ingredients blended properly with your current machine then chances are there isn't enough power behind its blades to do the job right! Investing in a more powerful model with higher wattage may be worth considering if this issue persists after regular troubleshooting has been done on the current model being used at home). 
 
4 .Blade Quality & Sharpness : Poor quality blades or dulled blades from wear-and-tear over time are common bottle necks which prevent proper blending from taking place within blenders today due to their inability cut through tough ingredients like frozen fruits & vegetables as well as nuts & seeds effectively enough before they become liquefied into liquid form during operation periods; investing into new blade replacements may help alleviate this problem significantly if other factors such as lack of power doesn't seem likely responsible for any issues experienced here when troubleshooting before replacing anything else first!
