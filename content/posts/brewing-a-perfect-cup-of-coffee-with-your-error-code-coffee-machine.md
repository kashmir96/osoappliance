## Making the Perfect Cup with an Error Code Coffee Machine
Despite the initial panic when our coffee machine displays an error code, it may actually be a simple fix, and you could be enjoying the perfect cup of coffee in no time. This guide will go through the most common error codes and provide tips on how to resolve them, so you can make the perfect cup of coffee in no time. 

Error codes on coffee machines can usually be resolved easily, usually all it takes is a bit of troubleshooting. The first thing that you should do when a coffee machine displays an error code is to look at the code and identify what it means. Most often, you can find this explanation in the user manual that came with the machine. Sometimes these codes are related to simple maintenance issues, such as descaling the machine. For example, one of the most common codes is an ‘Er1’. This is usually an indication that the machine is reaching its temperature too quickly, meaning that the descaling process needs to be carried out. 

Other codes can indicate a problem with the water supply, such as a blocked filter or a faulty water pump. If a code appears with either of these issues, then you should check the water supply first and make sure that everything is in order. If there are no problems with the water supply, then you may need to try running a few tests on the machine to make sure that everything is functioning correctly. 

Once you have identified the cause of the error code and made the necessary repairs, it is time to start brewing your perfect cup! The first step is to make sure that your grounds are freshly ground and of a good quality. This will ensure that all of the flavours are extracted correctly and that you get the tastiest cup of coffee possible. You should also take the time to experiment with different amounts of grounds and water that you use in order to find the perfect ratio for your own cup of coffee.

## FAQs About Brewing a Perfect Cup of Coffee with Your Error Code Coffee Machine

1. What are the best coffee beans to use with Error Code Coffee Machines?

It's best practice to research the type of bean that your specific Error Code Coffee Machine works best with, however many customers are finding great success with both dark and medium roast beans. It’s important to note that the quality of your beans will determine the flavor of your finished cup of coffee. 

2. What things should I take into account for optimal brewing?

When using your Error Code Coffee Machine, the grind size, water temperature, and brewing duration are all important factors to consider. Delicate flavors will be lost in coarse grind sizes and over-extracted in finer grind sizes, so aim for a medium grind size. Water temperature should be below boiling, around 195-200 °F. Finally, brewing duration is important - too long and the coffee will be bitter and too few will leave it weak, so follow the machine’s recommended time or experiment and find what works best for you. 

3. What type of filter should I use in my Error Code Coffee Machine? 

Basket-style paper filters are recommended for use with Error Code Coffee Machines, as they are designed to remove most of the oils that naturally occur in coffee beans. This will give you a cleaner, purer cup of coffee. 

4. What kind of water should I use in my machine?

Using a purified or filtered water will give you the best cup of coffee, as it is free from chlorine and other impurities that can adversely affect the taste. Tap water can be used, but you may see the taste of the coffee impacted and the machine can become scaled quicker depending on your tap water.

5. What maintenance does an Error Code Coffee Machine require?

Error Code Coffee Machines should be descaled periodically (approximately every 6 months or 2,000 cups of coffee) to ensure proper operation. Additionally, the filters, hoses and tubes should be checked and replaced as necessary. Finally, check the gasket seals, if they are loose or worn they will cause coffee grounds to get lodged in the machine, preventing proper drainage.
