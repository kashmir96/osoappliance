As a homeowner in Christchurch, it's important to ensure that your washing machine is serviced regularly and maintained properly. Regular servicing and maintenance of your washing machine ensures that it runs efficiently, reduces the risk of breakdowns, and can even help prolong its lifespan.

For those living in Christchurch, there are a number of service and maintenance options available ranging from DIY maintenance to professional servicing. DIY maintenance involves checking for signs of wear and tear, cleaning the interior and exterior of the machine, checking hoses for cracks or leaks, replacing worn parts, and ensuring all settings are correct. Depending on your level of expertise, this can be done without any professional assistance. 

Professional servicing is generally recommended for more complex issues such as faulty motors or valves or blocked drains. This involves using specialist tools to diagnose the problem before repairing or replacing any necessary parts. Professional servicing also offers additional benefits such as advice on how to optimise energy efficiency and reduce running costs in the future. 

In addition to regular servicing and maintenance, it's important that you also use high quality detergents that are specifically designed for washing machines. This will help reduce build-ups of dirt and bacteria which can cause problems over time if not regularly cleaned out. 

The long term benefits of regular service and maintenance for your washing machine are numerous; an efficiently running machine helps save energy costs while reducing wear-and-tear on the parts which can ultimately extend its lifespan by many years. In addition, having a well maintained appliance also helps maintain cleanliness - which is especially important when dealing with items such as baby clothes or bedding!
