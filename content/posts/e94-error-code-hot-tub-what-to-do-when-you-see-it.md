## Coping With the E94 Error Code in Hot Tubs

If you're a hot tub owner, you already know how much time, money, and effort is required to keep your tub in top condition. One of the most important things any hot tub owner should do is familiarize themselves with with the different error codes that your tub might display. Fortunately, modern hot tubs are built with sophisticated technology and warning systems to help us understand and diagnose any problems that may arise. Today, we'll discuss one of these error codes: **E94**.

### Understanding the E94 Error Code

The E94 code signifies a problem with the temperature sensor. This error code can display itself when there is a problem with either the temperature sensor wiring, or the sensor itself and will require troubleshooting and further analysis.

### Diagnosing the E94 Error Code

To diagnose the E94 error code, start by checking the temperature sensor wiring. Inspect, clean, and/or replace all cables, wires, and/or connectors. Verify that all of the wiring is connected properly and make sure nothing has come loose. If the wiring looks ok, you may need to replace the temperature sensor itself. Replace the temperature sensor with a new one and check if you get the same error code.
