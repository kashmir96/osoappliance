## Get Organized With the Right Layout for Your Appliances

Your kitchen appliances can help shape the overall look and feel of the room. Finding the perfect layout for the appliances you already own or the new ones you’re planning to buy can improve the practicality, aesthetics, and even safety of your kitchen. With the right guidelines for arranging appliances, you can create an effective and stylish layout for your kitchen. 

The first factor to consider is the size of your kitchen as well as the appliances you have. If you have a large kitchen, you should consider creating a kitchen island. This can either serve as a cooking area, food preparation zone, or extra storage. The fridge can be focused alongside one wall while the range is situated opposite it.

The distance between a cooking range and the fridge should be relatively close, but not too close that activities in the kitchen become hindered. Make sure the kitchen range is securely set up so that it won’t move, even when lifting heavy cookware.

Cabinetry, storage, and countertops should be placed directly above or below the cooking range and fridge. This allows easy access to the pantry while cooking and ensures that tools, utensils, and ingredients are organized and within reach.

The height of the appliances should also be taken into consideration. Typically, microwaves and other countertop appliances should be placed at eye level for easier accessibility.

Lastly, make sure the layout will be comfortable, safe, and practical for you and your family. Not all kitchen layouts are versatile, but with a little thought and creativity, you can find one that fits your comfort and your design.

Organizing kitchen appliances can seem intimidating, but with the right layout and guidance, your kitchen will be as functional, organized, and easy on the eyes as you wish it to be.
