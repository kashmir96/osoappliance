## Troubleshooting Your Dishwasher F85 Error Code

Having a dishwasher is convenient for any household. So it can be quite bothersome and inconvenient if it malfunctions and displays an error code. One such error code is the F85 code, which can be quite tricky to figure out and fix. This blog post will tackle F85 error code, and provide some troubleshooting steps so you can get up and running again. 

The most common cause of an F85 error code is disruption in power or wiring, which can be caused when switching the dishwasher on or even turning it off. It is important to ensure that there is a proper connection to the power outlet before moving on to other possible causes. Determine if the power and wiring connections are secure, and if not, securely reconnect them. Once you have confirmed the wiring is secure and in place, check if the error is still present.

If the wiring connection and power are still intact, then the dishwasher’s control box may be the cause of the F85 error code. This could be due to a faulty switch or circuit board. If you are unable to identify the cause of the issue on your own, you may need to contact a technician who specializes in appliance repair. 

In some cases, the relay board may be to blame for the F85 error code. The relay board is an electronic switch which controls the dishwasher’s power. If this board is malfunctioning, it may cause the F85 code to appear. You should inspect the relay board to see if it is working properly. If it isn’t, then you should consider replacing it.

If all of these possible causes have been ruled out and you’re still not able to identify the problem, you can contact a professional appliance repair technician for help.
