1. Improved Safety: Double wall stove pipe is designed with two layers of metal which increases the safety of your heating system. It also reduces the risk of fire by providing a buffer between the hot exhaust from your stove and combustible materials in your home. This can help to reduce the risk of a chimney fire or other dangerous scenarios. 

2. Increased Performance: The two layers of metal in double wall stove pipe help to insulate the exhaust from your stove, which increases its performance. This can make your heating system more efficient, as it won’t have to work as hard to produce heat.
