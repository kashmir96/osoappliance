## Fixing a Broken Oven - Get the Advice You Need
From baking bread to roasting veggies, ovens are an essential part of the home kitchen. When an oven stops working, it can be more than a nuisance. In this guide, you’ll find all the tips, advice, and assistance you need to get your oven working as good as new.

### Assessing the Problem
The first step in fixing an oven is determining exactly what the problem is. There may be varying levels of oven difficulty, ranging from simply needing to be turned on or off to facing serious mechanical faliures. Before attempting to fix the oven, take the time to properly identify the issue by following the manufacturer's instructions. Check the user manual or visit the product website online for a complete list of troubleshooting tips.

### Troubleshooting Common Oven Problems
Common oven problems usually involve either the heating element or the thermostat. Turn the oven on, and check to see if the heating element is lit up or if it’s working as expected. If it’s not, you may have to replace it. In addition, an oven that does not reach the proper regularity could need a thermostat repair or replacement. 

Any repair or replacement of major parts of the oven should be handled by a professional appliance repair technician. Check out our [Appliance Repair Directory - Christchurch](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians/new-zealand/christchurch) for a list of certified techs in the local area who can help.

### Preventative Maintenance 
No matter the age of the oven, keeping it in proper working condition should always be a priority. Check regularly for any issues with the wires, ventilation, or indicator lights, and be sure to clear any spills or dried food particles immediately. Clean your oven regularly using baking soda or another non-toxic solution.

### Conclusion
A broken oven can be an unwelcome surprise, but with a little patience and some basic research, fixing it doesn’t have to be. Taking the time to properly assess the problem and familiarize yourself with the troubleshooting tips and preventative maintenance needed to keep it in good shape can help reduce the chance of additional issues in the future.
