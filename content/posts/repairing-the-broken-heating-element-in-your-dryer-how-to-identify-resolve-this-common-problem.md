## Troubleshooting and Fixing a Broken Heating Element in Your Dryer 
Are you noticing a decrease in the heat produced by your dryer? If so, there's a good chance your dryer is having issues with its heating element. When the heating element wears out, it decreases the amount of heat in your dryer and can ultimately cause the dryer to malfunction.

Identifying the broken heating element in a dryer can be a tricky task for the average person. It is a complex electric system and requires some knowledge of how electric dryers work to properly identify and fix the issue. Some signs that can help in diagnosing a broken heating element in a dryer include an increase in drying time, a burning smell, and an electric shorts sound.

Once the broken heating element is identified and located, you'll need to replace it with a new one. You can either purchase a new heating element online or find one at a local appliance store. Before you begin the replacement process, be sure to turn off the electric supply to the dryer unit. After the power is cut off, unscrew and remove the back panel on the dryer to access the heating element. The heating element is typically in the back of the dryer and easy to identify. At this point, you'll need to disconnect the heating element from the wiring and from the drum. 

Once you’re finished removing the dryer's heating element, take the new element out of its packaging. Then insert the new heating element into the dryer, reconnect it to the wiring and drum, and secure it in place with the screws. To finish up, turn the power back to the dryer and test it.

Repairing a broken heating element in your dryer doesn't have to be difficult if you know how to identify the problem quickly. With the right tools and a bit of knowledge, anyone can replace their dryer’s broken heating element with minimal effort.
