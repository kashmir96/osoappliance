## Resetting a Panasonic Washing Machine

If you own a Panasonic washing machine and are having issues, you may need to reset it. A reset will put back all the settings to the factory defaults, wiping off any temporary settings that you may have changed. But not to worry- the reset is fast, easy and totally reversible. 

To reset your Panasonic washing machine, first you'll need to unplug it from the power outlet. Then you need to press and hold the Start/Pause button for about three seconds, or until you hear a beep. You should then see the indicator lights turn off to show that the reset has been successful. 

Now your washing machine will be on its factory reset settings, allowing you to program any settings that you want to the machine the way you like it. Generally the steps are the same for most models of Panasonic washing machines, but if you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to consult our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/). 

Resetting your washing machine shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and you should feel secure that if you ever need to, you can easily reset it back to its original settings. So don't be intimidated by appliance repairs- try our easy tips and tricks to make sure that your Panasonic washing machine is running properly when you need it the most.
