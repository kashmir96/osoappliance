If your oven is not heating up, it can be a very frustrating experience. There are several possible causes for this problem, and some issues can be resolved without the help of a professional appliance repair technician. Before calling an expert from our directory, here are some things you should try to get your oven working again.

First, check to make sure that all the knobs and switches on the oven are in the correct positions. If these settings are incorrect, then it could prevent the oven from heating up properly. Additionally, make sure that all wires connected to your oven have been securely attached and that none of them have become loose or disconnected over time.

Once you’ve checked all of these things, examine the power cord that connects your oven to a power source (like an outlet). Make sure it is firmly plugged in and secure – if there is any fraying or damage to this cord then it could be preventing your oven from heating up properly. If you find any damage at all with this cord then you should replace it as soon as possible since it can be a fire hazard if left unchecked.

Finally, inspect the bake element for any signs of wear or damage – such as cracks or black spots on its surface – which may indicate a short circuit inside of it that needs attention right away! If everything looks fine with both elements then try resetting their positions by turning off its power source (unplugging) and waiting 10 minutes before plugging back in again - sometimes this will fix minor issues like temperature control problems without needing further attention from an appliance repair technician 

If none of these solutions resolve your issue then you may need to contact an experienced professional appliance repair technician from our directory for help with more complex repairs like replacing faulty parts inside your unit (such as the thermostat).
