## Keeping Your Home Safe from Electrical Hazards
Electrical hazards can lead to serious injury and, in worst case scenarios, death. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce the chances of this happening in your home. Implementing the following safety tips can help you and your family stay safe when using household appliances. 

### Electrical Safety Tips
* Have your home inspected by a qualified electrician regularly. An electrician can locate faulty wiring and other potential hazards.
* When using extension cords, make sure to choose cords that are rated for the type of appliance you’re using and have an appropriate length.
* When using multi-plug adapters, make sure to use ones that are not overloaded.
* All major household electrical appliances should have a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) installed. This will help protect you from electric shock.
* Make sure to unplug any appliance before attempting to do maintenance or repairs.
* Don’t use damaged power cords or cords with exposed wires.
* Keep all cords and wall outlets free of dust and frayed wire.

By following the safety tips above, you can help prevent dangerous electrical accidents in your home.
