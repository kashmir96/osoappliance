## Fixing the Stressful Error Code 'Hose' on Electrolux Washing Machines
Have you ever been in a situation where you were so close to finishing up your laundry, only to be smacked in the face with an error code during the rinse cycle? If you've been dealing with an Electrolux washing machine displaying the code "Hose" lately, you know what I'm talking about! 

While error codes can be difficult to troubleshoot, this specific issue can be easily resolved. The "Hose" code can appear on Electrolux washers with either a built-in drain hose or a separate pump unit, and it typically indicates either a blockage in the drain hose or a problem with the pump. 

The first step in resolving this error code is to check the drain hose for blockages. Make sure the hose isn't kinked, and that there are no obstacles obstructing the flow of water out of the machine. If your drain hose is built-in, you may need to check for objects that have been left in the drawer. If you have a separate pump unit, you'll want to check for detritus in the pumps filters. If the filters are clogged, you'll need to clean them and then reset the circuit breaker to restart your washing machine.

If the problem persists after checking and cleaning the drain hose, you'll want to inspect the drain pump. If your pump is blocked or damaged, it'll need to be replaced. This is best performed by a professional technician, so you may want to contact the manufacturer or a local service provider to book an appointment. 

Error codes can be a major headache, but thankfully most issues can be resolved with a quick inspection and a little bit of cleaning. If your Electrolux washing machine is displaying the error code "Hose," be sure to check for blockages in the drain hose and possible damages to the drain pump.
