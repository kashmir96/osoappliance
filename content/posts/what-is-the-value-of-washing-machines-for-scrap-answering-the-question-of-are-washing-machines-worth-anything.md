## Washing Machines: Are They Worth Anything for Scrap?
Do you have an old washing machine in your house that you no longer use? You may think that it’s just taking up space and not worth anything, but you may be surprised! Despite the wear and tear an old washing machine has gone through, you may actually be able to make some money off of it. 

What makes washing machines so valuable is that they consist of materials that can be recycled. Most washing machines contain several materials such as plastic, rubber, metal, and even glass. All of these components can be recycled and sold on the scrap market. Depending on the size of the machine and the working condition, you could receive anywhere from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars. 

When considering recycling or scrapping your old washing machine, it’s important to take into account the condition of the internal components. If the washing machine’s motor or agitator is still in working condition, you could make more money from it. By simply unbolting and disassembling the machine, more of the scraps can be sold to recycling centers or scrap buyers. 

Carrying a washing machine off to the scrapyard may also bring an opportunity to avoid costly demolition costs or landfill fees. Not to mention, it’s a great way to recycle and help the environment. 

In conclusion, despite the amount of wear and tear an old washing machine may have, it can still be worth something for scrap. By taking apart the machine and selling the parts to recycling centers or scrap buyers, you can make a substantial amount of money.
