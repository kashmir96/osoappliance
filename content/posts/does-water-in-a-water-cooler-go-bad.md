Water coolers are an incredibly convenient way to access cold, filtered water with the simple push of a button. But does water in a water cooler go bad? The answer is no, the water itself won't spoil, but if not properly maintained, the cooler can become contaminated and the quality of the water can be affected.

The biggest health risk associated with a water cooler is that it isn’t always cleaned or maintained as often as it should be. Bacteria and other contaminants can collect on surfaces like spouts, taps and handles. To ensure your family’s safety and avoid illness-causing germs, it's important to keep your water cooler clean to prevent any potential contamination.

When cleaning your cooler, make sure to pay special attention to areas like spouts and taps that come into contact with hands or cups when refilling them. Be sure to disinfect these surfaces regularly with hot soapy water or a diluted bleach solution (one tablespoon per gallon) that has been approved for drinking purposes by health authorities in your area. Additionally, you'll want to replace filters every 3-6 months depending on how many people use it regularly as well as how often you refill it with tap or bottled water. This will help keep bacteria from growing inside the machine due to stagnant or old H2O. 

Finally, be sure all parts of the equipment are dry before turning it back on – moisture in electronics can lead to damage over time! All these steps will help ensure that not only does your family have fresh tasting drinking without worry but also that their health is protected from any potential contamination caused by a neglected machine!
