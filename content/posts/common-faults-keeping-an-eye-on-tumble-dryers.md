## Tumble Dryer Faults - Keeping an Eye

Tumble dryers are a great convenience for homeowners, but faulty operation can lead to bills for servicing or even replacement. Keeping an eye on any potential issues is essential for maintaining an efficient dryer. This blog will discuss the common faults associated with tumble dryers and the importance of addressing these issues promptly.

When it comes to tumble dryers, the most common faults to watch out for include blocked vents, built up lint, or simply worn out or damaged parts. Blocked vents can lead to overheating and affect the drying process, while built up lint can lead to clothes remaining damp. Parts can become worn down or even broken over time, and this should be addressed as soon as possible to avoid potentially more expensive repairs and servicing costs.

Other warning signs to look out for include abnormal noises, reverse cycling, and unbalanced loads. Abnormal noises such as grinding or squealing can be a warning sign of a damaged drum or belt, and should be checked out by a qualified repair technician. Reverse cycling occurs when the dryer isn't drying clothes and is instead forcing warm air out, and this is often a sign of a failed thermistor. Unbalanced loads can lead to the dryer shaking and can sometimes cause a motor to burn out, so always make sure to evenly distribute items across the drum.

Keeping an eye on your tumble dryer is essential to maintain efficiency and avoid more costly repairs or replacements. Although not every fault or warning sign needs to be immediately addressed, if neglected they can lead to potential damage and costly repairs or replacements. If you are ever in doubt, it is best to call a qualified repair technician to ensure your dryer remains in efficient condition.

4. **What is the best type of maintenance to keep a tumble dryer in good condition?** To ensure the best performance of your dryer, it is recommended to schedule regular maintenance runs. This means that you'll need to check the internal components and clean the lint filter after every use.
