## Understanding Fault Codes and Clearing Them
When dealing with malfunctioning appliances, fault codes are important information that can help you diagnose the issue. Instead of blindly replacing a part or troubleshooting with no definite answer, fault codes can provide an indication of what’s wrong with your appliance. However, should you clear fault codes and, if so, how? Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of clearing fault codes.

### Pros of Clearing Fault Codes

The main advantage of clearing fault codes is that you can begin from a fresh perspective during your troubleshooting efforts. Clearing the codes can be especially beneficial after complete a repair has been completed as it gives you a fresh start before you begin using the appliance again. Furthermore, in some cases, previous fault codes can occasionally prevent the appliance from working so clearing them can help here.

### Cons of Clearing Fault Codes

The drawbacks of clearing fault codes is that you are disregarding helpful information that could indicate the source of the problem. In some cases, this might result in you wasting time and energy trying to isolate the source of the problem when the fault code would have given you the answer. Additionally, in order to identify the proper fault code, some manufacturers require appliance test modes to be used, which can be difficult and time-consuming. 

### Understanding Fault Codes and Clearing Them

When it comes to fault codes and whether you should clear them, the decision is ultimately going to be based on the severity of the issue. If the problem is serious, such as the appliance not working at all, then you may need to clear the codes so that you can begin troubleshooting from a clean slate. Conversely, if the issue is minor, then clearing the codes might not be the best option as it could be depriving you of valuable information. 

If you’re uncertain what action to take, you can use our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) as a reference to better understand what the code could be telling you. Understanding the codes can help inform your decision whether or not to clear them.
