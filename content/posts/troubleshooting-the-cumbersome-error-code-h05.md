Error Code H05 is typically generated by a malfunction in the main control board of your appliance. This error has been connected to a short circuit and is most commonly caused by a power issue, such as an electricity supply issue, voltage fluctuation, and other power problems.

Replacing the main control board is one of the most common solutions for Error Code H05, so it is best left to the qualified professionals.
