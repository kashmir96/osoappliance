## Unlocking Your LG Appliance with a 3-digit Code
If your LG appliance is not working, you may need to reset the appliance using a 3-digit code. This code is used to unlock the front panel on the appliance and allow you to access the necessary settings or components. Resetting your appliance with the 3-digit code is relatively easy and can be done in just a few steps.

First, locate the 3-digit code printed on the front panel of the appliance. Enter this code into the designated area of the appliance, also found on the front panel. The user should then press the 'Reset' button, which will unlock the front panel and allow the user to access any internal settings or components that are needed in order to fix the appliance.

It is possible that you may have difficulty accessing the code. If the code is obscured or unreadable, you may need to contact a professional technician or LG customer service line for advice on how to unlock the appliance. The technician or customer service representative should be able to provide specific instructions for resetting your appliance.

In most cases, resetting your LG appliance with a 3-digit code should be enough to restore the appliance to its intended function. However, if the appliance is still not working, you may need to consult a professional to evaluate the appliance further.
