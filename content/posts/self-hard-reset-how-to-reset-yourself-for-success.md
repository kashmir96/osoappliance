## Resetting Yourself for Success

It can be difficult to stay focused and motivated in order to reach our goals and succeed. We frequently get sidetracked and find ourselves in places we don’t want to be in. That’s where a self hard reset comes in - a reset of our mindset and environment that can help us break free and start anew. 

A self hard reset is all about taking a step back and making changes in order to push past the current state you may feel stuck in. This process can involve deleting old relationships, habits, and routines that have been weighing you down. Doing this can help clear out mental clutter and give you a chance to bring in new, positive energizing elements into your life. 

Making small changes can be effective too. Setting up a comfortable space with healthy snacks and drinks, and creating a schedule that works for you can help support your success. Creating a playlist or writing down inspiring or insightful quotes can also act as a reminder of the end goal and help keep energy levels up when obstacles arise. 

The main idea with self hard resetting is staying focused on the end goal and removing anything that works against it. Your reset should be tailored around your own individual needs and wants while being realistic. Resetting yourself doesn’t mean you need to undergo a full life makeover! Though it can be invigorating to try out new things and go after your dreams, it is important to stay within your limits. Success should be a balanced pursuit so don’t worry if it takes longer to get to where you want to be than you had originally planned.
