Are you in the market for a new washing machine? If so, then now is the time to buy in New Zealand! A washing machine is a major investment, so it pays to shop around and make sure you get the right one for your needs. 

The best time to buy a washing machine in New Zealand is between August and October. This is when appliance retailers have their biggest sales and offer the most competitive discounts on washing machines. Plus, there are often special offers during this period such as free delivery or installation services. 

When it comes to choosing the right washing machine for your home, there are a lot of factors to consider. First of all, think about how much laundry you do on an average week; this will determine what type of model you need (e.g., top-loading or front-loading). You should also consider how much space you have available and what features are important to you (e.g., energy efficiency ratings). 

It's also important to take into account running costs; some models use more energy than others so make sure you compare them before making your decision. Most manufacturers provide details about their products' energy consumption online or in stores. Additionally, check what warranty options are available; some manufacturers offer extended warranties that can save money if something goes wrong with your purchase down the line. 

Finally, don't forget to factor in delivery costs when comparing prices between different models - some retailers may offer free delivery while others may charge extra for this service so always be sure to check before buying! 

Overall, now is definitely an excellent time of year to buy a washing machine in New Zealand if you're looking for great value and lots of choice! With careful research and comparison shopping, you're sure to find an appliance that meets all your needs at a price that suits your budget.

If you're looking to buy second hand, then a few months later is usually the best time, as this is when people have just upgraded their machines and are looking to free up their space in the garage. 

Good luck and happy shopping!
