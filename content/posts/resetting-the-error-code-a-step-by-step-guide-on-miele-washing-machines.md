## Resetting Error Codes on Miele Washing Machines

There’s nothing worse than when laundry day is here and your Miele washing machine won’t turn on or is displaying an error code. You think you know what to do but you don't. Never fear, resetting the error code on a Miele washing machine is easy with these few simple steps. 

Begin by determining the exact error code. Consult your washer’s manual or search online to ascertain exactly what the code means. Miele washing machines are equipped with safety switches which are released once the lid is open. If your machine is flashing the error code F63 or F82 because the lid is open, press down on the top of the lid to make sure the safety switch has been released. 

If the resetting process doesn't work for you, there are a few other fixes to try. Unplug the machine from the power source and plug it back in. Another option is to reset the entire appliance by pressing down the three buttons “Alarm”, “Start” and “Spin” together for three seconds. Hold the buttons until the entire cycle of the lights disappearing and reappearing has been completed twice. This can sometimes fix the washer’s self-diagnostics. 

Finally, if resetting the error code did not solve the issue, consider having a service technician to come and take a look. Appliance repair staff come prepared with the knowledge and parts they need to fix the problem and get your washing machine working like new in no time. 

In conclusion, resetting the error code on a Miele washing machine has never been easier. If you’re not sure what the error code means, consult your manual or an online resource like our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) to get started. If none of the solutions provided are working, it may be time to call a skilled technician to come and take a look at the appliance.
