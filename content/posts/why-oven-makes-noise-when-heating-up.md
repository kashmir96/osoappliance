When you turn on your oven, you may notice that it makes some noise. This noise is often normal and should not cause alarm, but it can be a little confusing if you’re not sure what’s causing it. Generally speaking, the noise your oven makes when heating up is caused by the heating elements inside the oven expanding and contracting as they heat and cool. 

The heating elements in an oven are made of metal, which expands when heated and contracts when cooled. As these elements heat up and cool down during the preheating process, they can make a slight crackling or popping sound as they expand and contract. This is completely normal and should not be cause for concern. 

In some cases, an oven may make a loud banging or rattling sound while preheating. This could be caused by loose parts inside the oven cavity or by something blocking the fan blades from spinning freely. If this is the case, you should contact a qualified appliance repair technician to check out your oven and make any necessary repairs. 

Noise from your oven while preheating is usually nothing to worry about, but if it becomes excessive or changes in any way then you should have it checked out by a professional to ensure that everything is functioning properly.
