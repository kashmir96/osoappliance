## Learn How to Fix Your Miele Washing Machine's Error 031
It’s common to encounter malfunctions when using household appliances. One of the most awkward issues is an error code appearing. In this blog, we’ll help you out if you’ve encountered error code 031 when using your Miele washing machine, and teach you how to fix the issue.

When a Miele installation error code 031 is reported, it means that the water valves of the washing machine have failed in one way or another, or the system doesn’t recognize the water valves.

When the code is shown, you should check if the drain hose is placed too high because it can lead to the water not entering the washing machine. If the drain hose is in the recommended or proper position, it’s most likely that the valves are malfunctioning or blocked. To fix the error, you should have them inspected as soon as possible.

If you’re unsure about how to start diagnosing the issue, it’s better to have a qualified technician have a look at it. Appliance malfunctions are nothing to take lightly and it won’t be worth it to try to fix it on your own if you don’t have sufficient technical knowledge.
