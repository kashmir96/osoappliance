## Average Lifespan of a Whirlpool Washing Machine

Knowing the expected life of your household appliances helps you budget costs, plan for maintenance needs, and get the most out of your investments. Many people are curious about the average lifespan of a Whirlpool washing machine. This article will cover the lifespan of these machines and offer tips on how to extend their longevity. 

When considering the average lifespan of a Whirlpool washing machine, there are a few things to consider. First and foremost, although many factors come into play when determining the life of a washing machine, the average lifespan can fall between 10 - 14 years. Of course, this can be affected by factors such as usage, frequency of maintenance, and if repairs are made to the machine. The type of Whirlpool washing machine – be it a top loading or front loading model – can also affect the lifespan. 

With regular maintenance and usage, a Whirlpool washing machine can be expected to last anywhere from 9 - 10 years. This includes regularly checking the hoses for signs of wear, checking the machine for proper balance and distribution, using the right type and amount of detergent, and preventative maintenance measures such as cleaning the inside of the machine. It is recommended that you purchase an extended warranty, particularly if the machine is going to be used more frequently. Doing so can give you peace of mind and help cover any unexpected costs.

Owners looking to extend the lifespan of their Whirlpool washing machine even further can take preventative measures. Regular cleaning and checking of the lint filters, glass doors, and rubber seals will help keep the machine in top shape. Additionally, purchasing and installing a water softener system can help protect the machine from corrosion and rust damage, and a surge protector helps protect from electrical surges that can damage washers and other appliances.

It’s important to know the average lifespan of a Whirlpool washing machine, as well as the maintenance and prevention practices associated with these machines, so that you can care for them and get the most out of your investment.
