If you’re considering replacing your old air conditioning unit, you may be wondering what the scrap value of the unit might be. Many people don’t realize that air conditioning units have scrap value, but they do. The amount of money you can make from scrapping an air conditioning unit will depend on a variety of factors, including the age and condition of the unit and what parts are salvageable. 

The most valuable part of an air conditioning unit is the copper tubing inside. Copper is a valuable commodity and can fetch up to $2 per pound at scrapyards. Since most AC units contain about 20 pounds or more in copper, it can be quite profitable to sell your old one for scrap if it’s still in working order. If there are other salvageable parts such as motors, compressors or wiring, then these may also have some scrap value as well. 

In addition to salvaging copper from AC units for its monetary value, many people also choose to recycle them for environmental reasons. Recycling helps reduce waste and conserve resources by keeping materials out of landfills and reusing them in new products or repurposing them into something else entirely. Recycled air conditioners can often be used as spare parts for other machines or even turned into art projects! 

The best way to determine how much an old AC unit is worth is by taking it to a local scrapyard that specializes in electronics recycling. Scrapyards typically offer different rates depending on how much material they get from each individual customer so it’s important to shop around before making a decision about where to sell your AC unit for scrap value
