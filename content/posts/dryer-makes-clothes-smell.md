A dryer that is not functioning properly can lead to a wide range of issues, one of which is your clothes smelling bad. This issue can be caused by several different problems, and luckily there are some easy fixes you can do yourself before having to call a repair service. 

The first issue that could cause your clothes to smell bad after being dried in the dryer is an accumulation of lint in the vents or filter. Lint buildup can cause the dryer's airflow to be restricted, preventing the heat from drying your clothes thoroughly. This can leave behind damp areas on clothing that may develop a musty smell over time. To fix this problem, simply clean out the lint trap and any air ducts leading away from the dryer regularly. 

Another cause of smelly clothes after drying could be a clogged vent hose or ductwork. If you notice any kinks or blockages near these parts of your machine, they need to be cleaned out as soon as possible so air flow isn't restricted again and heat can reach all areas of your clothing for even drying times. 

Finally, if you're still noticing unpleasant smells coming from your dryer even after cleaning it out thoroughly, it could mean there is an issue with its heating element or motor fan belt being worn out over time - both essential components for proper functioning and drying times. In this case it's best to contact a professional repair service since those pieces may require replacing entirely instead of just cleaning them out like with simpler issues such as lint buildup or clogged vents/ducts etc.. 

In summary, smelly clothes after being dried in the dryer usually means something needs attention inside your machine - like lint buildup in filters/vents needing cleaning or maybe an issue with its heating element or motor fan belt needing replacement due to wear and tear over time - but it's important also that you take care when trying to fix these problems yourself so no further damage occurs!
