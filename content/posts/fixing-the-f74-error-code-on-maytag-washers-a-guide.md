## Troubleshooting Maytag F74 Error Code

Do you own a Maytag washer and have experienced the F74 error code? You're not alone. Many Maytag washer owners have faced this troubling issue. Fortunately, there's a way to fix it. Read on to learn more about the F74 error code, its root cause, and how you can resolve it yourself. 

The F74 error code indicates a motor control unit (MCU) problem. This can be caused by a problem with an internal connection or a faulty MCU. In some cases, the problem may be caused by having too much soap or fabric softener in the control panel drawer. The best way to diagnose and determine exactly what's causing the F74 error code is to remove the Washer's outer case and use a multimeter to test the wiring harness.

If your Washer has no power, it's best to start by checking the power cord and the circuit breaker. If these are both working correctly, then you may need to proceed to troubleshoot the wiring. Pay special attention for any loose or broken terminals or wires. If everything checks out ok, then the problem may be the MCU itself and will need to be replaced. 

Before attempting to replace the MCU, be sure to disconnect the power from the Washer. Once the power is disconnected, you can then remove the control panel cover in order to gain access to the MCU. Once the part is safely removed, you will then need to transfer the wiring to the new part and reconnect the power. After completed, restore the Washer's outer case and the issue should be resolved. 

In order to fix the F74 error code on Maytag Washers, you will need to troubleshoot the wiring harness and, in some cases, even replace the motor control unit (MCU). Doing this yourself can be challenging and time-consuming, so we recommend enlisting the help of a qualified appliance repair technician.
