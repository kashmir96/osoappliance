## Lights Blinking When Air Conditioner Comes On: Mystery Solved

Have you ever been startled by lights in your home turning off and on when the air conditioner comes on? It can be quite alarming and confusing. As it turns out, this phenomenon is easily explained and related to a feature of a standard household circuit. In this blog post, we're exploring what causes lights to blink when the air conditioner comes on and how to identify the underlying cause.

When the air conditioner kicks on, it draws a bit of electricity from the power supply to get going. This is usually enough to cause a small dip in the voltage on the power supply. This dip in voltage can cause the lights in the house to flicker. This is normal electrical behavior and the lights should return to normal once the air conditioner is running. 

It is possible that you could experience flickering lights because of a faulty circuit in the house. A faulty circuit can cause the voltage to dip too low, or the power to turn on and off rapidly, which can cause the lights to flicker. If it continues causing a disruption even after the air conditioner has been running for a while, it might be a good idea to have the circuit checked out.

Some air conditioners have a built-in feature called a "soft-start" which delays the conditioner starting up. This counteracts the voltage dip and prevents the lights from flickering. If you have an air conditioner with this feature it can help reduce the flickering of lights as well.

In conclusion, it is quite normal for the lights in the house to flicker when an air conditioner comes on. However, if the flickering continues after the air conditioner is running for some time, there could be an issue with the circuit in the house and should be inspected by a professional.
