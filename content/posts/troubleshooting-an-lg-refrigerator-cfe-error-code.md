## Troubleshooting LG Refrigerator CFE Error Codes

If your LG refrigerator has stopped cooling and is displaying a “CFE” error code, then you are likely facing an issue with the evaporator fan. This indicates an issue with your refrigerator’s cooling fan system and will need to be diagnosed and fixed in order to restore proper cooling.

First and foremost, you should perform the basics in order to rule out other issues. Make sure that no cross-over of the electrical connections occurred between the evaporator fan and condenser fan motors, and ensure that the anti-tip wire is securely plugged in.

To ensure that the evaporator fan motor is the culprit, you should also check for any obstructions in the vent system, such as ice build-up, which can prevent the fan from turning on and cause the error code. Also check the fan blade, filter and fan housing for any debris. If you are unable to check the fan directly, you can remove the rear panel and listen carefully for any noise that may be coming from the fan.

If the fan appears to be operating correctly and the compressor is running, yet the error code still is displayed, then the issue may be a faulty fan motor or wiring. If the fan is not operating at all, then this could be due to a failed start relay, fan motor or control board.

Fortunately, if you are unable to resolve the issue yourself, it is easy to find a reliable repair professional in your area who can diagnose and fix any problems with your LG refrigerator.
