If you’re looking for a new washing machine, you’ve made the right decision. A good washing machine can be one of the best investments you make in your home, as it will help to keep your laundry clean and save time on washday. But with so many different makes and models available, deciding which washer is right for you can be confusing. 

To help make your decision easier, here are some tips on what to look for when shopping for a washing machine: 

-Consider the size of the family: If there’s only one or two people in your household, then a smaller capacity washer may suffice. However, if there are more people or large loads to wash then opt for a larger capacity model. 

-Choose a user-friendly model: Ensure that the control panel is easy to use and understand before making your purchase so that operation is straightforward and hassle-free. 

-Check out energy efficiency ratings: Look at how much electricity each unit consumes (kWh) as well as their water consumption rate (litres). Higher efficiency ratings will mean lower running costs over time so it pays to invest in an economical appliance which saves money in the long run. 

-Select features with care: Do you need additional functions such as steam programmes or delay start options? Think about what extras would be beneficial before making any decisions – these can add extra convenience while keeping running costs down too! 

Now that we’ve established some important points when buying a new washing machine, let’s look at some of the best makes available on the market today…
