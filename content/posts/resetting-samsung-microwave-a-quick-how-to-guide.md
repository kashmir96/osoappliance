## Resetting Your Samsung Microwave Glitches the Simple Way
It can be frustrating when you own a fancy Samsung microwave, but the settings and programming get glitchy. When this happens, resetting your microwave is the easiest way to address the specific issue you are having. By following the steps below, you can quickly and easily reset your Samsung microwave and get it back to a fitting and proper working order.

The first step is to make sure you have the main power switched off to your microwave. This could mean either unplugging the device from the wall or flicking off a breaker in the fuse box if it is hard-wired into the electrical system. Once this is done, you will have to open the cabinet of your microwave and locate the control board. This can usually be found on the right hand side once the door is opened, and will have several wires connected to it.

Disconnecting these wires can be a difficult task in itself, so take care not to pull too hard, or use a tool that may damage the wiring. After the wires are disconnected, you will have to press and hold the START/STOP button on the board while you reconnect the main power again. Continue to hold the button until the microwave runs a self-test, after which you can close the door and re-apply power to the unit.

If for any reason the microwave does not seem to be functioning or does not begin the self-test, then further diagnostics may need to be completed on the unit. To ensure that you have the right information and codes to determine the specific issue, check out our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) which provides more information.

By following these quick steps, you can easily reset your Samsung microwave and ensure it is in a fully-functional working order. If your microwave is not functioning to your satisfaction after being reset, then further diagnostics may be needed to identify the underlying issue. Our comprehensive glossary is a great tool to make sure you have the right codes and information for troubleshooting.
