# What can i do with an old dryer

Do you have an old dryer that you're not sure what to do with? If so, you're not alone. Many people have an old dryer that they're not sure how to put to use. But don't worry, there are plenty of creative and useful ways to repurpose an old dryer.

One of the most popular uses for an old dryer is as a fire pit. With a bit of creative engineering, you can turn an old dryer into a safe and cozy outdoor fire pit. Simply cut a hole in the top of the dryer and line the inside with fireproof material. You can even use the dryer door to control the size of the fire.

Another great idea is to use your old dryer as a planter. Simply remove the drum and fill it with soil and plants. You can even paint it to match your outdoor decor.

You can also repurpose an old dryer into a storage cabinet. Remove the drum and front panel, add shelves, drawers, and other storage features. This is perfect for storing items like extra linens and towels.

Finally, you can use your old dryer as a pet bed. Simply remove the drum and line it with a comfortable cushion. Your pet will love snuggling up in their new bed.

As you can see, there are plenty of creative and useful ways to repurpose an old dryer. So don't just throw it away. Instead, get creative and find a new purpose for your old dryer.
