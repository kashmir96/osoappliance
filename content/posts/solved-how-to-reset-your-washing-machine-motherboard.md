It’s easy to take the dependability of our household appliances for granted - until something suddenly stops working. Your washing machine is no exception, and the motherboard is often responsible for instances of breakdowns. Luckily, with the right steps, you can easily reset and repair your washing machine’s motherboard in no time. 

To start resetting the motherboard, gather all the necessary tools - including and a flathead screwdriver, an antistatic brush, and an antistatic cover. After unplugging your washing machine from its power source, you should take off the back panel and very carefully inspect the motherboard for any signs of scorching or burned components. If you cannot identify any problems, you need to carefully unplug the main connector of the motherboard. 

After unplugging the connector, you should use the antistatic brush to clean the motherboard before you proceed to replug it again. You will have to make sure that the wires are properly connected during the replugging process, and that the fasteners of the board are securely fastened. To make sure that the motherboard is being safely reset, you should double-check the connection of the wires and the board. 

Once the motherboard is back in place and its connection is secure, you can return the back panel and plug the machine back into its power source. With the motherboard reset, you can finally try to run a cycle and enjoy your reliable appliance once again.
