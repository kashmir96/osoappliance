## Overcoming Common Dryer Issues

It's never fun when you go to do a load of laundry only to find that your dryer isn't functioning properly. Fortunately, this does not always mean that you need to purchase an entirely new model. There are a few common issues that you can attempt to fix yourself. In this blog, we'll cover what to look for and common solutions for tackling the most common dryer problems.

The first step in diagnosing a dryer issue is to identify what is causing the malfunction. Is it a lack of tumbling, too much heat, or an inadequate drying performance? Each of these symptoms can point to a different issue, and a proper diagnosis is the first step to getting your machine running smoothly again.

If the drum of your dryer is failing to rotate, this could be due to a broken belt or a clog in the exhaust system. If the belt has become frayed, or is no longer connected to the drum, then it should be replaced. You can check to make sure the belt is properly installed and in good condition by pulling it away from the drum and checking the ends. Additionally, you can try to check for a clog in the exhaust system by running the dryer on a short, increased heat cycle. If heat is not able to escape, then you may need to clean out the exhaust system. 

If your dryer is too hot, then this could be caused by a malfunctioning thermal fuse which is designed to shut off the heat if it exceeds a certain temperature. If this happens, then you may need to replace the fuse, which can usually be done quite easily. 

Another common issue is inadequate drying times, which can be caused by lint buildup in the lint trap. Make sure to always empty the lint trap after every completed cycle and to clean it regularly. If you are still finding that it is taking too long to dry your clothes, then you may need to clean out the vent system leading from the dryer to the outside.

When it comes to tackling the most common dryer problems, proper diagnosis and troubleshooting are the keys to success. A few simple checks and repairs can often get a dryer back up and running in no time, restoring the convenience of your laundry routine and saving money on a costly replacement.
