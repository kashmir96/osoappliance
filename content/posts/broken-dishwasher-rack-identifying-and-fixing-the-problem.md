## Identifying and Repairing a Broken Dishwasher Rack

Having a broken dishwasher rack can be irritating, disruptive and discouraging. Without proper cleaning, dishes won't be as hygienic and clean as you need them to be. But, thankfully, understanding what's wrong and how to fix it isn't as daunting as it may initially seem. This blog post will explain how to identify a broken dishwasher rack and how to go about fixing it.

When assessing a dishwasher rack, the most common issue is broken tines, rails and wheels. To check these parts, open the dishwasher door and take a look at the metal rack inside the appliance. It's important to note that the wheels should move freely and the tines should be intact without being too loose or too tight. 

If the wheels are malfunctioning, the most likely cause pertains to dirt and grease getting stuck in the tracks. Furthermore, there may be some kind of obstruction impeding the movement of the wheels. As a first step, check to see if the wheels are indeed obstructed, and if so, remove any foreign objects. It can also be helpful to use a damp cloth to wipe down the tracks. 

When it comes to broken tines, the good news is that the part is usually replaceable. Replacing the rack is my recommended course of action, but if this isn't feasible, use a rubber band or basic wire ties to keep the tines in track.

Finally, if the dishwasher rack rail is broken, it needs to be replaced. This part can be purchased online in many cases, as well as through your local appliance shop. Be sure to measure your dishwasher to get the correct size rail for your unit.

There you have it! With the above steps, you should be able to identify and repair a broken dishwasher rack without much fuss.
