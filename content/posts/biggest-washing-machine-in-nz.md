# Largest washing machines in nz

Do you want to upgrade your laundry room with a new washing machine? Are you looking for the largest washing machines available in New Zealand? If yes, then you’ve come to the right place.

In New Zealand, the largest washing machines typically measure around 11kg. However, some models have a much larger capacity and can hold up to 16kg of laundry. These are ideal for large households or if you have a lot of washing to get through in one go.

When choosing a washing machine, it’s important to think about the size of the drum. A larger drum will mean you can fit more clothes in per load, so you’ll be able to get your washing done quickly and efficiently. It’s also important to consider the spin speed, as a higher spin speed will mean your clothes will come out much dryer, meaning less time in the dryer.

When it comes to features, the most popular washing machines in NZ are front-loading models. These are energy efficient and have a range of additional features such as delay start, quick wash and special wash programs.

Finally, it’s important to think about the warranty and after sales service when purchasing a washing machine. Many brands in New Zealand offer a 5-year warranty and also provide excellent after sales service, so it’s worth checking this out before you buy.

Overall, when it comes to buying a large washing machine in New Zealand, there are plenty of options available. It’s important to consider the size of the drum, spin speed and features, as well as the warranty and after sales service. With the right machine, you’ll be sure to get your laundry done quickly and efficiently.
