## Understanding the Reasons Behind a Dryer's "Error" Message

When your dryer suddenly flashes up the error message, it can be disheartening and confusing. Finding out the cause and how to remedy it can also be a stressful process. Fear not, this blog will clue you in on what you need to know.

Error messages usually mean that something within your dryer is either out of sync or misaligned. This could be a mechanical, electrical fault, or something else altogether. This could be something as simple as a poor connection, or it could be something more complex like a circuit failure. In some cases it may be indicative of a faulty part that needs to be replaced.

Different brands of dryers have slightly different error codes and messages. Many modern dryers have sophisticated onboard diagnostic systems that are able to inform you as to which fault the message is related to. If your dryer doesn't have an actual fault code being displayed, then you can reset the dryer by unplugging it and re-connecting it again. In some cases you may need to physically disconnect the wires to the dryer and reconnect them.

If you're unsure which fault is being referenced then it might be time to consult the user manual that came with your dryer. Most of the time, the user manual will include a list of common error codes, and the steps that can be taken to resolve them. If the fault is still not fixed then it may be best to call a professional to carry out the required repairs.

Ultimately, if your dryer is displaying an error message then it should not be ignored. Knowing exactly why the error message is being displayed and how to take the necessary steps to resolve it will help save on time and money. Before researching further or calling a professional, take the time to assess the situation and take the necessary safety precautions to stay safe.
