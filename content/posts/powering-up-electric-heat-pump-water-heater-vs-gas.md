## Electric Heat Pump & Gas Water Heater: Comparing Benefits

Installing a new water heater can be a major decision when it comes to household appliances. Whether it's an electric heat pump, or a gas water heater, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each will help make sure your home is equipped with the best choice for your situation and budget.

The primary benefit of electric heat pump water heaters is their energy efficiency and low operation costs. The heat pump extracts latent energy from the air and uses it indirectly to heat the water. A large variety of sizes and designs are available to fit any need, and they are quieter and last longer than traditional water heaters.

Meanwhile, gas water heaters are more reliable and efficient in terms of their power output, but comes with their own set of caveats. Extra ventilation must be taken into account due to the by-products of gas burning, and gas leaks must also be monitored. They are more affordable than electric, but require a more expensive installation.

Whatever your choice, make sure to do your research and compare your options. Our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview) page is the perfect place to start discovering the best water heater for you.
