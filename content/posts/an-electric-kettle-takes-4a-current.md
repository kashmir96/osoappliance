An electric kettle takes 4 Amps of current when plugged into a standard wall outlet. This is because the typical voltage in an outlet is 120 Volts, and when you multiply that by the 4 Amps, you get 480 Watts. That’s the amount of power that the electric kettle needs to heat up water quickly.

When electricity passes through a wire, it creates heat due to its resistance. The more current that passes through it, the more heat is produced. So, by using 4 Amps of current, an electric kettle can generate enough heat to bring water to a boil quickly and efficiently.

In addition to its high electrical rating, an electric kettle also has several other features that make it ideal for heating water quickly and safely. For instance, most models come with an automatic shutoff feature which turns off the power after a certain amount of time has passed or when the water reaches boiling point. This ensures that your kettle won’t overheat and cause any damage or fire hazards in your home. Additionally, kettles often come with built-in temperature control settings so you can select how hot you want your water to be before turning off the power source automatically once it reaches that temperature setting. 

Overall, electric kettles are great for heating up water quickly and efficiently thanks to their high electrical ratings (4 amps) combined with user-friendly features such as temperature control settings and automatic shutoff functions for added safety measures.
