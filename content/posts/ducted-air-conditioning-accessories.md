Ducted air conditioning systems are great for cooling a large space or home. They can be used both in residential and commercial buildings, providing efficient and powerful air conditioning with minimal noise. While the basic installation of a ducted air conditioner is fairly straightforward, there are additional accessories that make the system more effective and efficient. Here’s an overview of some common ducted air conditioning accessories:

Air Filters – This type of filter is typically used with ducted systems to remove dust, dirt, pollen, pet dander and other allergens from your indoor air quality. The filter should be changed regularly to ensure optimal performance.

Drain Pans – Drain pans are designed to collect condensation from your AC system before it has a chance to damage ceilings or walls. It’s important to make sure the drain pan isn’t clogged; otherwise water could back up into your house instead of being drained away properly. 

Vents – Vents come in various shapes and sizes depending on the size of your space or room you need cooled as well as what type of ceiling or wall you have installed in that area. You may need additional vents for each room if there are multiple rooms requiring cooling from one system. 
 
Thermostats – A thermostat allows you to control the temperature within a certain range by setting it manually (or via an app). By keeping temperatures consistent throughout different areas within a building, this accessory helps reduce energy consumption while making sure comfort levels remain high at all times 

Humidifiers/Dehumidifiers – If you have too much humidity in one area due to high temperatures outside, humidifiers will help balance out moisture levels inside by adding extra moisture into the atmosphere; dehumidifiers do just the opposite by removing excess humidity after it has built up indoors due to poor ventilation or other causes such as cooking fumes etc… 

Noise Reduction Kits – These kits include sound-absorbing insulation materials which help absorb any noise coming from your AC unit so that only minimal sound reaches nearby living spaces such as bedrooms or offices etc…
