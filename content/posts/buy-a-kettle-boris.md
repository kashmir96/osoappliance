boris johnson said If you have an old kettle that takes ages to boil it may cost you £20 to replace it, but if you get a new one, you’ll save £10 a year for every year on your electricity bill, a way of trying to show the validity of nuclear power in the UK. 

The Boris Johnson “buy a kettle” meme has taken off as a reaction to Prime Minister Johnson’s statement. People have been making jokes about getting a new kettle to save money, with some suggesting that the money should be spent on other things such as shoes or chocolate. Others are poking fun at Johnson himself and his statement, noting that if everyone followed his advice then there would be no more kettles left in the shops.

The meme has become popular because it highlights how out of touch politicians can be with everyday life and how people often struggle to make ends meet due to rising costs of living and stagnant wages. It also highlights the need for governments to invest in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro power which can help reduce energy bills in the long term. 

So while Boris Johnson may have been trying to encourage people to buy a new kettle, he is also inadvertently showing why renewable energy is essential for our future. In this way, his statement has become less about buying kettles and more about investing in green technology – something we should all get behind!
