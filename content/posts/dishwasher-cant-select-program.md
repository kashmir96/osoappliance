If your dishwasher is not selecting a program, there may be a number of reasons why. The first thing to check is the power supply. Make sure the dishwasher is plugged in and the power is turned on. If the power is on, then the next step is to check the control panel. Make sure the buttons are working properly and that the program you are trying to select is available.

If the control panel is working properly, then the next step is to check the water supply. Make sure the water is turned on and that the water pressure is adequate. If the water pressure is too low, it can prevent the dishwasher from selecting a program.

If the water supply is adequate, then the next step is to check the drain. Make sure the drain hose is connected properly and that the drain is not clogged. If the drain is clogged, it can prevent the dishwasher from selecting a program.

If the drain is clear, then the next step is to check the filter. Make sure the filter is clean and free of debris. If the filter is clogged, it can prevent the dishwasher from selecting a program.

If the filter is clean, then the next step is to check the detergent dispenser. Make sure the detergent dispenser is filled with detergent and that the dispenser is working properly. If the detergent dispenser is not working properly, it can prevent the dishwasher from selecting a program.

If all of the above steps have been checked and the dishwasher still cannot select a program, then it is likely that there is a problem with the control board. The control board is responsible for controlling the dishwasher's functions and if it is not working properly, it can prevent the dishwasher from selecting a program. In this case, it is best to contact a professional to repair the control board.
