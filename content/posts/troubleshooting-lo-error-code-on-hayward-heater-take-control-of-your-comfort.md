## Troubleshoot a Lo Error Code on a Hayward Heater
When trying to keep your home at a comfortable temperature, your heater is essential. A Hayward heater can help you reach that goal, but at times you may need to troubleshoot a Lo error code. This code can indicate a number of possible issues with your heater, including clogged filters, improper wiring, and more. In this blog, we will discuss why you may be getting a Lo error code, and how to fix it.

If you have a Hayward heater and you receive a Lo error code, the first thing you should do is check the air filter. Air filters can become clogged with dust and dirt, causing the air intake to be restricted. If your air filter is clogged, it's important to clean or replace it and then cycle the system to see if the error goes away. You should also be careful to not overfill the filter, as this can also cause a Lo error code.

In addition to the air filter, you will want to also check the wiring and electrical components of your Hayward heater. This includes checking the power supply and resetting the circuit breaker. Be sure to turn the heater off before attempting any wiring repairs and make sure anything you do is in compliance with local codes. If in doubt, hire a professional to make sure the wiring is done correctly.

If neither of these methods resolves the problem, it could be due to a problem with the gas valve or burner. If this is the case, you should contact a qualified technician to troubleshoot and repair the issue. Doing this can help you restore the desired comfort level in your home, and give you peace of mind that your heater is safe to use.

Troubleshooting a Lo error code on a Hayward heater can seem daunting, but it's important to take control of your comfort. By following these steps, you can take the first step in solving any issue with your heater. If you're ever in doubt, be sure to look up a professional [appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) in your area.
