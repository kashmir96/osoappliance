## Trouble-Shooting Your Refrigerator Issues 

When your refrigerator isn't running properly, it can be frustrating. From strange noises to strange temperatures it can be frustrating to track down the problem. This guide will help you troubleshoot common issues with your refrigerator and provide you with the knowledge to understand and find solutions to problems yourself.

Before beginning, check to make sure the refrigerator is plugged in and the power is turned on. Also check to make sure there is enough ventilation around the refrigerator and that it is sitting level on the floor.

If the interior temperature of your refrigerator is not cool enough, check to make sure the temperature setting hasn't been unintentionally changed. If the setting has been changed, adjust it to the appropriate setting for your needs. It's also important to check for obstructions blocking the flow of cooling air to ensure efficient performance. If the seal on the door is worn or out-of-place, you may need to replace it.

If your refrigerator is unusually noisy, check for worn parts inside the motor. If the motor is worn it could be creating friction and causing noise. You may also want to check for debris in the fan blades, these can cause a loud noise as the blades move. 

Check the condenser coils at the back or beneath the refrigerator for dirt and debris, these should be cleaned regularly. If the condenser coils are too dirty, they may be generating more heat than they should and cause the unit to work too hard. 

Finally, it's important to check the error codes present on digital display fridges. While this isn't common, there may be an error code that is pointing you towards a specific issue in your fridge. Our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) provides detailed explanations for many of these common error codes.
