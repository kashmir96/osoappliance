## Taking Positive Action to Force Drain a Miele
Having an issue draining water from a Miele washing machine or dishwasher? There are a couple of methods you can use when attempting to force the draining of a Miele appliance. Doing so can be an effective way to regulate water levels and correct any problems with how your appliance is attempting to drain.

For a washing machine, start by unplugging the appliance and accessing the filter trap. Remove the filter and clean it of any sediment build-up. If that doesn't solve the problem, you can remove the drain hose to unhook it from the pump's pressure-relief valve. If this doesn’t work, you will likely need to replace the pressure-relief valve.

For a dishwasher, you may need to manually scoop out any lingering water by hand. If this still isn't enough, you will likely need to take off the drain cover and unhook the drain hose from the appliance. If this isn’t working, you may need to replace the drain pump motor. 

In either case, consulting a technician at your local appliance service is the best way to obtain an accurate diagnosis of why your Miele is failing to drain properly.
