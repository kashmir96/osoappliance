If your dryer smells like skunk, it’s likely due to the build-up of lint and other debris in the lint trap and exhaust vent. As lint and other materials accumulate over time, they can start to produce an unpleasant odor. This odor is often described as being similar to that of a skunk.

Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to get rid of the skunk-like smell coming from your dryer. The first step is to clean the lint trap and exhaust vent. Start by unplugging your dryer and removing the lint trap. Use a vacuum cleaner or a lint brush to remove any debris from the lint trap. Then, use a long-handled brush to clean out the exhaust vent.

Once the lint trap and exhaust vent are clean, you can also use a special dryer vent cleaning kit to help remove any remaining lint and debris. This kit typically includes a brush and a vacuum attachment that can be used to clean the entire length of the exhaust vent.

Finally, you can also use a deodorizer to help get rid of the skunk-like smell. There are a variety of deodorizers available on the market, including sprays and gels. Simply spray the deodorizer into the dryer and the exhaust vent and let it sit for a few minutes before running the dryer.

By following these steps, you should be able to get rid of the skunk-like smell coming from your dryer. However, if the smell persists, it’s best to contact a professional for further assistance.
