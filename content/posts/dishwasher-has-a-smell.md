If you’ve noticed that your dishwasher has a strange smell, you’re not alone. Many people experience this issue, and it’s a common problem. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to get rid of the odor and keep your dishwasher smelling fresh.

The first step is to make sure that you’re regularly cleaning your dishwasher. This means running a cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or vinegar every few weeks. This will help to remove any built-up food particles and soap scum that can cause odors.

You should also make sure that you’re regularly emptying the dishwasher’s filter. This is the part of the dishwasher that catches food particles, and it can get clogged up with debris over time. Emptying the filter regularly will help to keep it clean and free of odors.

Finally, you can try adding a few drops of essential oil to the dishwasher’s rinse cycle. This will help to mask any lingering odors and leave your dishes smelling fresh.

These steps should help to keep your dishwasher smelling fresh and free of odors. If you’re still having trouble, you may need to call a professional for help.
