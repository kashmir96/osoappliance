## Refrigerators and Recycling Rules

Recycling old household appliances such as fridges comes with certain rules that must be followed. As responsible consumers, understanding why you can't simply scrap your old refrigerator is important to protect the environment. Let's take a closer look at why you have to abide by certain restrictions when recycling old fridges and other household appliances.

There are a variety of materials used to make old appliances such as refrigerators, meaning they cannot simply be recycled in the same way as paper or plastic. It's possible that hazardous materials such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are present in the fridge which would be harmful to the environment if released. As such, laws exist in different countries to control how these old appliances are disposed of.

The correct way to recycle your old fridge depends on where you live. In the US and UK, licensed collectors or recyclers must take these items away and dispose of them in a safe and legal way. Contacting a licensed collector is important as you can be sure that the materials will be recycled correctly, without harming the environment. 

In some countries, you can even be offered a cash incentive for recycling old refrigerators. In the US you can receive a $50 rebate when you submit proof of recycling. This is a great way to save money while making sure your appliance is recycled in a responsible way. 

By understanding why certain restrictions are in place when recycling old fridges, you can ensure that you're disposing of your item in the most responsible and legal manner.
