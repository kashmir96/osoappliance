## Understanding the Most Common Faults on Washing Machines
Owning a washing machine can make households a lot easier to keep clean, but sometimes these household appliances can give us headaches. To help you keep on top of any problems, it can be useful to have an understanding of the most common faults. In this blog, we'll look at some of the most common problems that occur on washing machines and what you can do to fix them.

One of the most common issues that arise with washing machines is due to poor maintenance. The filter can easily become blocked if it's not cleaned regularly and this can cause the machine to not function properly. Many machines will display an error code if the filter is blocked, so be sure to check your user manual for instructions on how to clean yours. Additionally, if the machine isn't level, this can cause a great deal of noise when spinning and can even be dangerous. Be sure to check the feet at the base of the washing machine and adjust as necessary.

Another common issue is a broken drum. If your washing machine is no longer spinning, it could be a sign that the drum has failed. This could due to a variety of issues, such as a worn belt or broken motor, so it's best to call in a professional to assess the problem. Notably, never try to directly examine the drum yourself as this can be dangerous.

The last common fault we'll discuss is a broken valve. This can be a tricky one as it requires you to open up the machine and replace the valve, which we wouldn't recommend doing yourself. However, should you choose to attempt this repair, be sure to disconnect the power and water supply and take great care to not puncture the hoses.

As you can see, there are several common faults that can occur on washing machines. To ensure your appliance is in the best shape, be sure to perform regular maintenance, level the machine, and only attempt repairs if you have the skillset and knowledge.
