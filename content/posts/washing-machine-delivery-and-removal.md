If you’ve recently purchased a new washing machine or are in the market for one, you may be wondering about the delivery and removal process. Whether you choose to hire a professional service for delivery and removal, or to do it yourself, there are a few things you should know.

Delivery: When your new washing machine is delivered to your home, it will usually come in either one or two large boxes. When your delivery arrives, make sure that all of the parts have been included and that they’re in good condition. If anything is missing or damaged, contact the store immediately so they can replace them before they leave. Once all of the parts have been checked off and accounted for, it’s time to start assembling the unit. Depending on what type of washing machine you’ve purchased (top loading vs front loading), assembly instructions should be included in the box with detailed diagrams and instructions that will help guide you through each step. 

Removal: If you’re replacing an old unit with a newer model, then it will need to be taken out of your home prior to installation of the new one. This is typically done by disconnecting any hoses and power cords from the back of the old unit before tipping it onto its side for easy maneuvering out of your home. You can also contact local appliance stores who offer a removal service if this isn't something that you feel comfortable doing yourself. 

Regardless if you hire someone else or decide to do it yourself, make sure that all steps are followed carefully to ensure proper installation and safe operation when using your new appliance!
