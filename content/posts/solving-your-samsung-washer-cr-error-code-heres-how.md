## Understanding and Solving Samsung Washer CR Error Codes

Have you ever encountered a sudden CR error code on your Samsung washing machine? An error code can be distressing and confusing if you’ve never seen it before. Fortunately, most Samsung washer error codes aren’t too difficult to decipher and fix. 

Finding the right solution starts with properly understanding the meaning of the error code displayed. CR, specifically, can be an indicator of an issue with the motor or with the control board. However, before you take any deeper steps to figure out the root cause of the code, the first step is to unplug the washer from the power source and plug it back in. 

If unplugging and plugging back in does not help, the next step is to examine the washing machine’s motor. Open the back cover of the washer and check to see if the motor is securely connected to the power supply. If not, tighten the power cord connection before running the cycle test again.

If the motor is properly connected and the error code persists, then it’s likely that the control board is the source of the problem. If you want to try fixing the issue yourself, you’ll need to refer to your specific washing machine model’s online manual and look at diagrams of the control board. You should then be able to locate the wire connected to the control board and examine the connections for any loose wires. If any wires are connected improperly, you can use a simple screwdriver to take the washer apart and reconnect the wires as directed in the online manual. If you are uncomfortable with this step, contacting a professional repair service may be a better option than trying to fix it yourself.

In summary, when you encounter a Samsung washer CR error code, the first step is to unplug the washer from the power supply and then plug it back in. If that fails, check to make sure the motor is securely connected and the wires on the control board are properly connected. After taking these steps, you should be able to properly take care of the CR error code. 

If the Samsung washer CR error code continues to stay after unplugging and plugging back in or after check the motor and/or control board connections, contact an experienced repair service to help you properly diagnose and fix the issue.
