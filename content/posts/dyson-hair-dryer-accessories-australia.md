If you’re in the market for a high-quality hair dryer, Dyson is a great choice. With its impressive range of models, accessories and features, you can be sure of finding the perfect hair dryer for your needs. If you’re in Australia and looking to buy a Dyson hair dryer, there are plenty of accessories available to help you get the most out of your appliance.

The first accessory that may be worth considering is the Dyson Supersonic diffuser attachment. This attachment helps to evenly distribute air flow over your hair while drying it, resulting in increased volume and definition. The diffuser also helps reduce frizziness, making it ideal for people with curly or wavy hair. The Supersonic diffuser is compatible with all models of Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryers sold in Australia.

Another useful accessory available for Australian customers is the Dyson Cooling Stand. This stand helps keep your Supersonic Hair Dryer cool after use, allowing it to last longer and work more efficiently. The stand also has an LED display which shows you when the dryer has cooled down enough to be safely stored away. It’s ideal if you want to maintain optimal performance from your appliance over time.

Finally, if you’re looking for extra convenience when using your Dyson Hair Dryer, consider investing in a wall mountable storage hook accessory kit from Dyson Australia. This kit includes two wall mounts which allow you to store up to three attachments at once on any flat surface such as a wall or cabinet door – perfect if space is limited! You can also purchase additional hook kits separately if required depending on how many attachments you have or plan on buying in future! 

No matter what type of styling tools or accessories you need for your new Dyson Hair Dryer – whether it's replacement filters or additional attachments - there are plenty of options available online from retailers like Amazon and eBay that ship within Australia as well as directly from the official website itself! With so many options at hand, finding exactly what you need should be easy and convenient!
