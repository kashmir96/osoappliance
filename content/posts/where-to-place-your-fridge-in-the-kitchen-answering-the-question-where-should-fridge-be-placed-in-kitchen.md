## Finding the Ideal Home for Your Fridge in the Kitchen

When it comes to furnishing and planning the layout of your kitchen, the refrigerator plays an important role in determining the most efficient and ergonomic design. It is important to know where to position your fridge in respect to the other kitchen appliances, cabinetry, and other items. For maximum convenience, a refrigerator should be placed to conveniently allow you to access the most used items quickly and without needing to maneuver around barriers.

When deciding on the best location for your refrigerator, consider whether to place it on an inner or outer wall. An inner wall will keep your fridge away from direct sunlight while ensuring that it is close to your countertop work space. The ideal inner wall placement will be near the center of the kitchen, away from the entrance door. This will ensure easy access to the refrigerator no matter where you are in the kitchen and the door swing won't be blocked by other cabinets and appliances when open.

In contrast, it is also possible to place the refrigerator on an outer wall. This could be an ideal spot for kitchens with limited space, or where there are no other kitchen appliances or counters on the wall. Outer wall placement will provide access to the fridge from the entrances of the kitchen. As with inner wall placement, ensure the fridge door will open fully with unobstructed swing motion.

In terms of height, place the refrigerator in the portion of your kitchen that is most comfortable and practical for you. This could be either at a handy waist-level or lowered to relevant heights for children. Keep the location of the thermostat of the fridge in mind, as it needs to be within reach and easy to adjust.

When planning the positioning of your refrigerator in the kitchen, you should also think about the best plan of action for using any accompanying features. For example, ice makers may require plumbing fittings and a water supply. Additionally, plan for door access with other appliances and furniture to avoid obstruction when the fridge is open.

No matter which route you choose for locating your refrigerator, always make sure to place it in an area with plenty of space for efficient use. Keeping this in mind, it is also important to factor in safety considerations and the overall aesthetic of your kitchen. After you have found the ideal spot for your refrigerator, you can move on to selecting the perfect model for your household needs.
