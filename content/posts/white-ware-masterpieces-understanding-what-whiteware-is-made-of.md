## Whiteware: Examine Materials Used in Everyday Appliances 
We use a variety of appliances in our daily lives, most of which are white in color, known as "whiteware". This white colored material is made up of several individual layers, each performing an important function. As a general consumer of and user of household appliances, it can be beneficial to understand what makes up these everyday appliances and what materials are used to ensure their durability and performance. 

The first layer of whiteware is the shell or housing. This is the exterior surface that most consumers are familiar with. The shell is typically a metal or plastic material and its strength and durability are of utmost importance. Metal is the preferred housing material amongst engineers and designers as it provides solid protection against wear and tear and increases the lifespan of the product. The next layer of whiteware is the insulation material. This layer is responsible for stopping heat and sound from passing through the device and providing energy efficiency. The type of material used here can range from wood or metal to foam or fiberglass.

The third layer of whiteware is the heating element. This is usually the area where heat is generated by the appliance. In most cases, this heating element is made of metal, with either electric or gas elements used to generate heat. Finally, the fourth layer of whiteware is the coating. This layer adds protection to the appliance and also helps keep it looking good by preventing corrosion, erosion, and fading. It also helps to reduce sound and vibration levels.

As you can see, whiteware has several layers of materials working together to help ensure its performance and longevity. When choosing an appliance for your home, consider the type of material used in its construction to ensure you are getting a quality product that will last.
