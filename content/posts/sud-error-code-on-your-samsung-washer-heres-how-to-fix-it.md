## Troubleshooting the Sud Error Code on your Samsung Washer
If your Samsung washer is displaying an error code when you go to run a load, it can be unsettling. One of the most common codes you may see is the "Sud" error code. This code indicates that your washer has detected too many suds in the drum. Follow our instructions to help diagnose and fix this issue. 

It's important to note that before attempting the below solutions, you should always power down the machine and unplug it so there is no power going to the appliance.

The first thing you should do is run a rinse cycle without any items in the drum. This provides an opportunity to remove any suds that may be present. If you still experience the Sud error code after completing a rinse cycle, the next thing you should check is the amount of detergent you are using. 

Washers are built differently and require different amounts of detergent to wash your clothing properly. Generally speaking, the recommended amount of detergent to use depends on the size of the load you are trying to clean. Detergent can also build up in the drum and cause suds to occur and if this is the case, you should use less detergent when washing a load. 

If the detergent amount isn't the issue, then it may be an issue with your washer's water pressure. Low water pressure can cause detergent to become trapped in the tub, which can lead to the Sud error code being displayed. You can try running a load at a lower water level pressure to see if that works. If the issue persists, then it might be an issue with the machine's internal components such as a damaged drain pump.

Once you have run through these steps, you should be able to diagnose and fix the issue you are having with your Samsung washer.
