## Heed the Hazards of Microwave Radiation 

Microwave radiation is a form of electromagnetic energy produced by things like cell phones, the sun, two way radios, and even microwave ovens. As technology progresses and usage of these devices increases, we must be aware of the potential hazards of microwave radiation. This blog post will cover the potential dangers and discuss ways to stay safe. 

The most well known risk from microwave radiation is the potential for thermal injuries, as can happen when material close to the microwave is exposed to high levels of energy. Additionally, effects on the eyes and skin should be considered. This can include irritation, dryness, burning, and rash. It is also possible to experience dizziness, nausea, and headaches when exposed to high levels of microwave radiation â€“ especially over extended periods of time. 

The best way to avoid the potential risks is to be aware of the types of equipment that can produce microwave radiation, such as cordless phones, cell phones, WiFi routers, and more. Additionally, basic safety practices should also be implemented: turn off all electronic devices when not in use, make sure to keep them at a safe distance from your body, never place any products directly attached to the antenna of a microwave, and wearing protective apparel such as glasses or a hat. 

Overall, microwaves are a necessary and convenient part of 21st century life. However, the potential for health risks associated with microwave radiation should not be ignored. With knowledge and precaution, staying safe from the hazards of microwave radiation is easy.
