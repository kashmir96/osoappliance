Dryers can catch on fire due to a variety of causes. The most common cause is lint buildup inside the dryer or ductwork. Lint is highly flammable and can catch fire if it accumulates in large enough quantities. Other causes include a faulty heating element, a broken belt, overloading the machine, or even a foreign object that has become lodged in the dryer's drum.

The best way to prevent dryer fires is to make sure lint is cleared out at least once a year. This should be done by removing the lint trap and cleaning out any visible lint buildup with a brush or vacuum hose attachment. It's also important to clean out the venting system behind your dryer, as this can become clogged with dust and debris over time. Make sure to check for blockages between your dryer and venting system by pulling out the hose from both ends; if there are any kinks or bends in the hose, remove them so air can flow properly through it. Additionally, you should never overload your dryer; doing so will increase its running time significantly and could cause it to overheat and potentially spark a fire. 

Finally, have your dryer inspected annually by an appliance technician who will be able to look for any potential issues that may need repair before they become dangerous hazards that could lead to fires in your home. Taking these preventive steps will help reduce unneeded wear on your machine while ensuring its safe operation throughout its lifetime!
