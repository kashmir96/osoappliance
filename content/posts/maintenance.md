## Learn how to stop dryer maintenance before it starts

Having the dryer repaired can be a costly experience. Fortunately, there are a few simple strategies that can prevent the need for expensive maintenance in the future. Regular cleaning and minor upkeep is the best way to minimize the need for major repair work. Here are some tips to keep your dryer in top condition.

### Clean the Lint Filter Regularly

The lint filter should be emptied after every load of laundry. If you let the lint build up, it can cause the machine to overheat and even potentially starting a fire. This could lead to costly repairs, so it's best to just take a few seconds after every load to empty the lint filter.

### Inspect the Drum

Checking the drum regularly will help you prevent any major damage. Make sure to check for any signs of looseness or for annoying rattling noises. If you do notice anything out of the ordinary, you may need to call a repair technician to take a look.

### Check Your Vents

The air vents can also be a major source of problems. Any build up of lint will cause costly issues. So make sure to check the dryer vents regularly. You may need the help of a professional repair technician if the vents need to be cleaned or replaced.

### Keep the Area Clean

The area around the dryer should also be kept clean. Removing any combustible items near the machine is incredibly important. Things like laundry detergent, fabric softener, and other combustible items should never be stored near the dryer.

### Follow the Manufacturer’s Guidelines

Finally, always be sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines. This will prevent any potential issues with the warranty if something goes wrong. It’s also important to follow any other recommendations the manufacturer makes when it comes to caring for your dryer.

By following these simple tips, you can help prevent the need for costly dryer repairs down the line. Knowing how to maintain your machine and seeking the help of a qualified technician when needed is the best way to keep your appliance in great condition. 

If you need professional help with a dryer repair, it's best to call an appliance service technician. A qualified technician can help identify any major problems, as well as provide helpful advice on maintenance and upkeep.
