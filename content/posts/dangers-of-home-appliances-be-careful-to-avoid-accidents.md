It's important to check for any gas leaks and make sure the connection between the appliance and the gas supply is secure. Always keep an eye out for any signs of wear and tear, or potential leaks.

### Safety Tips
When using any home appliances, you should always adhere to the manufacturer's safety guidelines. Keep an eye out for any safety recalls, and take all necessary precautions to prevent accidents. It's also important to make sure that you're using the right type of appliance for the job you're doing.
