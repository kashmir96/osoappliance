## Troubleshooting Your Washer for First-Time Appliance Owners
When you move into a new home and are responsible for the upkeep of a washing machine for the first time, it can be confusing to go about troubleshooting any issues that may arise. Knowing how to properly diagnose and repair issues with your washer can help save you time and money. 

Before you jump into troubleshooting, it's important to understand how the washing machine works. The basic function of a washer is to fill with water, agitate the clothes, fill and drain, spin the clothes, and then stop. With the basic function of a washer, the two most common instances of trouble are when it won't start, or when it won't fill with water. 

If your washer won't start, the first step for troubleshooting is to check the electrical cord and make sure it is secure and connected properly. You should also check to see that the switch is in the ‘on’ position, or if the machine is powered on properly. You may also need to adjust the temperature and water level settings, or press and hold the start button for a few seconds. 

If the washer won't fill with water, the problem may be that the water supply is off. Make sure that the valve connected to the fill hose is turned fully on, and the hoses attached to the washer are not clogged or leaking. If the hose and valves seem fine, you may need to reset the washer if it gets stuck on a cycle.

When any of the issues described above are happening, it may also be helpful to check the instruction booklet that came with the washing machine. This will provide you with detailed information on how the appliance works and may help you with troubleshooting.

By taking the steps of understanding how a washing machine works and how to troubleshoot any issues, you will be well equipped when it comes to repairs and upkeep.
