The Trieste 6kg Sensor Dryer is a revolutionary new dryer that is designed to provide a more efficient and effective way to dry clothes. This dryer is equipped with advanced sensors that detect the moisture level of each item of clothing, allowing it to adjust the drying time and temperature accordingly. This ensures that clothes are dried quickly and evenly, without any risk of over-drying or damage.

The Trieste 6kg Sensor Dryer also features an innovative reverse tumbling action, which means that clothes are gently tumbled in both directions for maximum drying efficiency. This helps to reduce creasing and minimise the need for ironing. The dryer also has a range of settings including delicate, normal, heavy duty and anti-allergy, so you can choose the perfect setting for your laundry load.

The Trieste 6kg Sensor Dryer also comes with a range of additional features such as a child lock, delay timer and energy saving mode. The child lock prevents children from accessing the controls while the delay timer allows you to set the dryer to start at a later time when electricity rates are lower. Finally, the energy saving mode helps to reduce energy consumption by automatically reducing power when not in use.

Overall, the Trieste 6kg Sensor Dryer is an excellent choice for anyone looking for an efficient and effective way to dry their clothes. With its advanced sensors, reverse tumbling action and range of settings, it can help you save time and money while ensuring your laundry is dried quickly and evenly without any risk of damage or over-drying.
