# Worst appliance brands in christchurch

If you're in the market for a new appliance in Christchurch, New Zealand, there are quite a few brands to choose from. But it's important to do some research before making your purchase, as not all brands are created equal. In this blog post, we'll be taking a look at the worst appliance brands in Christchurch - so you can avoid them and make an informed buying decision. 

One of the worst brands currently available in Christchurch is Whirlpool. The company has been around for some time but their track record has been far from stellar when it comes to customer service and reliability of their products. Many customers have complained about problems with Whirlpool appliances such as faulty ice makers or dishwashers that stop working after only a few uses. Additionally, repair shops have reported that Whirlpool appliances can be difficult to work on due to their complicated designs and parts availability issues (or lack thereof). 

Another brand that’s best avoided in Christchurch is Samsung. Though they have many popular products on the market, many customers have raised concerns about the quality of their appliances when compared to other brands like LG or Bosch. From reports of faulty fridges and washing machines with short lifespans, it’s best to stay away from Samsung if possible when shopping for appliances in Christchurch. 

Finally, Electrolux is another brand worth avoiding if possible in Christchurch. The company has had numerous reports of poor reliability on various models such as ovens and dryers that fail after just a few months of use or refrigerators that don't keep food cold enough - indicating poor insulation design or poor manufacturing quality control issues.. Additionally Electrolux does not offer much customer service support or any useful warranties or guarantees which could mean additional costs for repairs down the line. 

Ultimately there are plenty of great appliance brands available in Christchurch but it’s always best to do your research before making any purchases - especially with expensive items like large kitchen appliances! By avoiding these three worst appliance brands - Whirlpool, Samsung and Electrolux - you should be able to find something more reliable and cost-effective while still getting great value out of your purchase!
