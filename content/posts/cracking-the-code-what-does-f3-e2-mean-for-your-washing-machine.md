### Interpreting Your Washing Machine's F3 and E2 Error Codes

Electronic appliances are getting smarter by the day, and washing machines are no exception. Instead of relying on manual adjustment or traditional repair, your washing machine can now alert you to a service issue using error codes. The most common error code combination is the F3 E2 error code, and decoding it can tell you exactly what's wrong with your washer, and how to solve the problem.

F3 stands for the motor control, and indicates that the sensor controlling the motor has failed or malfunctioned. Alternatively, E2 is an indication of water drainage problems, signaling that there is too much water in the washing machine during the draining stage.

When you see an F3 E2 error code, the first step is to empty the washing machine of any excess water. It may be necessary to also remove any clothing or foreign items that have been left behind as well. After this, you may need to reset the washing machine, as the error code may be caused by a programming issue or user-error. Simply press the restart button, and if your washing machine has a the delay cycle feature, disable it temporarily and restart the machine.

Whether this resolves the F3 E2 issue will depend on the intensity of the issue. If the reset and restart don’t help, you may need to replace the motor control sensor responsible for the F3 issue. Unless you know what you’re doing, this should be left to a qualified technician – a small mistake could worsen the error. 

Decoding and understanding the error codes associated with your washing machine is the key to fixing its issues.
