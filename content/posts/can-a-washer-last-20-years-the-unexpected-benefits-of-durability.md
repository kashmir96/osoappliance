## Can a Washer Last Two Decades? The Unexpected Value of Durability

When we purchase appliances for our homes, we want them to last for years. Generally, many appliances are designed to last anywhere from 8 to 10 years. But what if you could buy a washing machine with the expectation that it would last for 20 years?

The fact that a washer can last for 20 years or more is a testament to the durability of modern appliances. Better engineering and materials are being used to build appliances that are capable of lasting for decades. There are many washers that are touted to have a 20-year life expectancy, and these can provide an amazing return on investment.

Health and safety are also improved when using a durable washer that lasts a long time. Young children, recent college grads and elderly people all benefit from washing machines that have stood the test of time. Older machines that are still running can be certified as safe and reliable to use.

Finally, having a durable washer that lasts for 20 years can help preserve precious resources. When people have confidence in their appliance, they become more frugal in how they consume water, energy and detergents. This helps the environment since resources are used more judiciously and efficiently.

When it comes to appliances for the home, long-term durability is something to consider. You may be surprised to find that washers can last for 20 years with proper maintenance and usage. The resulting benefits from having a reliable and environmentally-friendly appliance are proof of its value.

It's important to remember that regular maintenance and checking for errors is essential for any appliance. To ensure that your washer lasts for 20 years, make sure to refer to our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) when troubleshooting any issues.
