## Easily Fixing Your Robot Vacuum in 6 Steps 
Robot vacuums have made many of our lives cleaner and easier. But when something goes wrong with your robot vacuum, it can be a daunting task to figure out how to fix it. Fortunately, there are 6 easy steps you can take to identify and fix the issue. 

First and foremost, be sure to read the robot vacuum’s manual and make sure you know it inside and out. Knowing what settings and functions the robot vacuum is capable of is essential for understanding what the problem may be. Take your time and become familiar with your machine.

Second, check the battery. Many times, the battery needs a recharge to get the robot vacuum back up and running. If this doesn’t help, you may then want to look at the brushes, as they accumulate dust and dirt which can interfere with the robot’s performance. Make sure to properly clean the brushes and check the brush guards to ensure there is no obstruction that is blocking the brushes from turning.

Third, examine the fan. A clogged fan will affect the robot’s speed of cleaning and its overall performance. Unplug the robot and make sure to clear out any debris or dust buildup that may be blocking the fan.

Fourth, check whether your robot has area mapping capability. This feature allows the robot to remember where it has already been as it cleans the entire room. If this feature is not working properly, it may be having trouble finding its way around the vicinity.

Fifth, flip the robot over and check to see if any of its sensors or wheels are stuck or hindered. You may need to use a cotton swab or a cloth with a bit of alcohol on it to gently clean the sensors or wheels if something is stuck on it.

Finally, if you find that none of these steps get the robot vacuum up and running properly, contact a professional service technician to help you fix your machine. A professional technician should be able to identify the problem and make the necessary repairs to get your robot vacuum back to its peak performance.

In conclusion, these 6 steps should help you identify and fix any problems you may have with your robot vacuum. Although it is easy to get overwhelmed if something goes wrong, these steps should help you get your robot vacuum back up and running in no time.
