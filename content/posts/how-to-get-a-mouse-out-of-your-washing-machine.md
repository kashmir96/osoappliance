If you’ve ever had the misfortune of finding a mouse in your washing machine, you know it can be a stressful and unpleasant experience. But don’t worry, there are a few steps you can take to safely remove the mouse and prevent it from happening again.

First, you’ll want to turn off the power to the washing machine. This is important for both safety and to prevent the mouse from getting further stuck in the machine. Remember, these machines have a large capacitor that will hold a dangerous level of charge for quite some time, it's best to unplug, press power button to help discharge and then leave it for a good hour or so to be doubly safe here. 

Next, you’ll want to open the washing machine door and look for the mouse. If you can’t see it, you can try gently shaking the machine or using a flashlight to help you locate it.

Once you’ve located the mouse, you’ll want to carefully reach in and remove it. It’s best to use a pair of gloves to avoid getting scratched by the mouse’s claws. Alternatively, you can leave some cheese and a trap nearby overnight to coax him out. 

Once you’ve removed the mouse, it’s important to clean the washing machine thoroughly. This will help prevent the mouse from coming back and will also help keep your clothes clean and free of any mouse droppings.

Finally, you’ll want to take steps to prevent the mouse from getting back in. This can include sealing any openings or cracks around the washing machine, as well as setting mouse traps around the area.

Getting a mouse out of your washing machine can be a stressful experience, but it doesn’t have to be. By following these steps, you can safely remove the mouse and prevent it from coming back.
