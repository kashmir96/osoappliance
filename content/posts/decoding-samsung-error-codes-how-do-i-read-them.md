## Understanding Samsung Error Codes
When a Samsung appliance stops working, an error code pops up to tell you what issue the machine is experiencing. Decoding these codes and understanding where the issue lies can be tricky. Read on to learn how to decipher the codes and fix the problem! 

Error codes for many Samsung appliances will show up on the digital display panel on the front of the appliance. Additionally, some lights may start flashing, beeping may occur, or the screen will display a code. If your appliance is displaying a code and you’re unsure of what it means, not to worry - help is here! 

In general, each code will consist of five letters and numbers and are broken down into two parts - the first three letters and the remaining two numbers. The first three letters refer to the source of the error - F means the freezer temperature is too high, and the remaining two numbers describe the exact issue. A 3F code means that the temperature inside the freezer is higher than -16°C and lower than 3°C. 

Some error codes will also have a letter at the end. This last letter refers to other, more specific issues like the door switch not functioning properly. Once you decipher the code itself, you’ll have a better understanding of where you should start looking to fix the problem. 

If the error code and your attempts to resolve the issue don’t work, you may want to call a technician to help assess the issue and fix your machine. While it can be a challenge to decode Samsung error codes, understanding the code can help you assess the issue and points you in the right direction for solutions. Ensure successful troubleshooting by referencing a [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/).
