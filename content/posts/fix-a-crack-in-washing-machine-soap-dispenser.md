# Fix a crack in washing machine soap dispenser

Is your washing machine soap dispenser cracked? A crack in the detergent tray can lead to soap spilling out during a wash cycle, resulting in an unsightly mess on your clothes and floor. Fortunately, repairing a cracked soap dispenser is relatively easy and requires only a few simple tools and supplies.

To fix a crack in your washing machine soap tray, you will need epoxy glue or putty, duct tape, sandpaper and gloves. Begin by cleaning the area around the crack with sandpaper. This will help the epoxy to adhere more effectively. Once you’ve cleaned it up, use the epoxy putty or glue to fill in the crack completely. Make sure to smooth it out evenly with your fingers or a small spatula so that there are no gaps remaining when dry. 

Now that you have filled in the crack with epoxy or putty, it’s time to reinforce it further with some duct tape. Place strips of duct tape across both sides of the tray where the crack has been filled in making sure that they overlap each other slightly for maximum strength. Allow this to dry for at least 24 hours before using your washing machine again. 

Once you have followed these steps carefully and properly repaired your washing machine soap tray, it should work as good as new! With this simple guide you should be able to easily fix any cracks that may appear in your washing machine soap dispenser without having to replace it entirely - saving yourself time and money!
