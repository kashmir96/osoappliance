Washing machines are designed to operate quietly and efficiently, but sometimes they can shake, vibrate, and even make a loud banging sound when in use. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including an unbalanced load, an uneven floor, or a worn-out suspension system. 

When a washing machine is shaking, it is likely due to an unbalanced load. This can occur when there is too much laundry in the machine or when the items are not evenly distributed. The imbalance creates an uneven spin, which causes the machine to shake and vibrate. To fix this, rearrange the clothes and redistribute them so that the weight is evenly distributed. 

Another common cause of washing machine shaking is an uneven floor. Washing machines are designed to operate on a level surface. If the floor is not level, the machine may rock, vibrate, and even move around when in use. To fix this, level the floor using a spirit level and shims. 

Finally, a worn-out suspension system can also be the cause of washing machine shaking. The suspension system is designed to absorb the shock of the spinning cycle, but it can wear out over time. If this is the case, the machine will need to be serviced and the suspension system replaced. 

In conclusion, washing machine shaking can be caused by an unbalanced load, an uneven floor, or a worn-out suspension system. To fix the problem, rearrange the load, level the floor, or have the suspension system serviced and replaced.
