When it comes to baking, oven temperatures are just as important as ingredients and techniques. Different recipes call for different temperatures, so it's important to know the most common oven temperatures. 

For starters, the average preheated oven temperature is 350°F (177°C). This serves as a good starting point if you’re not sure what temperature to set your oven at. You can always adjust from there depending on the recipe you’re following. 

A lower temperature of around 250°F (121°C) is usually used for slow cooking or keeping food warm after it has already been cooked. On the other hand, a higher temperature of 450-500 °F (232-260 °C) may be necessary for roasting or broiling certain foods like meats and vegetables. It's also helpful when making pizza or pastries that need to bake quickly at a high heat in order to achieve crispiness. 

If you're baking cakes and cookies, 375–400°F (190–200°C) is usually best in order to get an even bake without burning them on top while still allowing them time to cook through on the inside. For yeast breads such as dinner rolls or artisan breads, a slightly lower temperature of 325–350 °F (163–177 °C) works best in order to give the dough time to rise before it gets too browned on top. 

The most important thing when baking is that you use accurate measurements and take care not to overbake your food – whether that means setting your oven too low or too high! Knowing these common oven temperatures should help set you up for success with all your baking adventures!
