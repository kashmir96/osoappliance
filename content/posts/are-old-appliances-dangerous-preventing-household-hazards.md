## Are Household Appliances a Safety Risk?

The majority of households contain many electrical appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, heating units and air conditioning units, to name a few. Many of these appliances may be older and may require replacement or repair at some point. However, if older appliances are not properly maintained, or not replaced when needed, they can quickly become dangerous. 

When the filters and coils that cover the motor become clogged, appliances can become fire hazards. Many of these appliances actually exposet you to electric shock and carbon monoxide poisoning. It is vital to regularly check the status of your appliances and to ensure you are following the manufacturers safety guidelines for use. 

It is equally important to ensure safety when repairing, replacing or upgrading your appliances. The DIY route might offer the size of savings, but when it comes to electricity and gas, the risk of fire or explosion is real and much higher if you are not a licensed professional. If you are replacing an appliance, be sure to choose an item that is energy efficient. Older and inefficient units can be a costly burden on your electricity bill in addition to posing a risk to your home.

Finally, it is also important to remove any air intakes that may be covered by debris. If blocked intakes can prevent proper ventilation, leading to an accumulation of heat and carbon monoxide, especially when dealing with gas-consuming appliances.
