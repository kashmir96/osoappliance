## Reviving Discolored White Appliances 
Have you noticed your white appliances looking a bit dull and yellowed? Don't worry â€“ it's relatively easy to tackle discoloration and make them look as good as new! 

Depending on how discolored the appliance is, you'll want to either go for mild cleaning or a stronger chemical. If you've only got minimal discoloration (barely or slightly yellow) then the best thing to do is to use some mild soap or cleaning detergent with warm water. A soft cloth or cleaning sponge will do the trick when wiping onto the surface. 

For a more yellowed or heavily discolored appliance, you'll need to resort to chemical cleaners such as a non-abrasive bathroom cleaner. The back label should tell you how to apply and the surface should brighten up quickly. Be sure to read all instructions before starting to clean and ventilate the area well in case of any fumes. 

A mixture of baking soda and vinegar is also a great cleaning solution. Start by cleaning with a sponge and warm water, then make a paste with these two ingredients and rub it onto the surface with a cloth. Let it settle and dry before hosing down with warm water to reactivate any fizzing. Wipe dry with a clean cloth and it should be sparkling again!

Regardless of the cleaning method you choose, it's always a great idea to test it on a small patch of the surface first before going ahead. This will make sure the cleaner doesn't cause any damage, leaving your appliances looking refreshed. 

Reviving discolored whites appliances is easier than you might think. Just remember to work carefully, use the correct cleaner for the job, and always test on a small area before pushing ahead. If you're still having trouble, find a [local appliance repair technician](./pages/appliance-repair-technicians) to help bring back that factory finish.
