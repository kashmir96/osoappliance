## Unveiling Common Microwave Repair Problems

As one of the most used appliances in homes worldwide, microwave ovens are built to last but not to last forever. Identifying and rectifying the most common repair issues can save time and money, ensuring your microwave retains its dependability and efficiency. 

The age of your device, level of maintenance and frequency of use all act as catalysts for needed repairs. For example, causing broken electronics in the operating system, needing a new paint job, or a need for more frequent cleanings. Both mechanical and electrical issues can cause heavily used microwaves to breakdown. 

By far, the most common issues tend to be related to the electronics of the oven. This can include problems with power delivery, non-heating, keypad errors, error code display, faulty magnetron, and spark/arc issues. As most of these issues require a high level of expertise in order to be rectified, it's important to seek out professional help or advice if any of these problems arise. 

Another issue the can occur with microwaves is oxidation and discoloration. A type of corrosion, oxidation is caused by humid environments inside the oven and heat used during cooking. Though rare, cleaning the window of your microwave with a non-abrasive surface can help mitigate potential damage from rust and corrosion.

In summary, microwaves are essential household appliances that, when kept properly maintained, can last for years. However, if any mechanical or electrical problems arise, it's important to have them assessed by a professional ASAP to ensure that the problem is fixed and you are able to continue to get the full use out of your microwave oven.
