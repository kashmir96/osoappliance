Air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular as a way to improve air quality in homes and businesses. However, there are some potential problems with air purifiers that should be considered before purchasing one.

1. Cost: Air purifiers can be quite expensive, especially if you want one that is effective at removing a wide range of pollutants from the air. The cost of replacement filters can also add up over time. 

2. Noise: Many air purifiers produce a noticeable amount of noise, which can be disruptive if you’re trying to sleep or concentrate on something else in the room where the unit is located. 

3. Ineffectiveness: If an air purifier isn’t properly maintained or set up correctly, it may not remove all of the contaminants from the air as expected and could even spread some pollutants throughout your home or office environment instead of removing them from circulation altogether. 

4. Electricity Usage: Air purifiers require electricity to operate so they will add to your energy bill each month if used regularly for long periods of time throughout the day or night (depending on when it’s set). This can become expensive over time due to their power consumption requirements for operation and filter replacement needs as well as their operating costs associated with turning them on/off multiple times each day/night if necessary depending on your specific use case scenario(s). 

5. Maintenance: Most air purifier models require regular maintenance such as changing filters frequently in order for them to remain effective at cleaning your indoor environment efficiently and effectively over time without interruption due to clogged filters that don't allow sufficient airflow through them anymore (which reduces efficiency levels significantly). This means additional costs associated with replacing these parts/filters when needed which could add up quickly depending how often they need replacing (and how much they cost) - so this is something you'll need keep in mind when shopping around for an appropriate model suitable for your particular needs & budget constraints too!
