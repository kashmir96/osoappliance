## Time to Get Your Drive Belt Dryer Repaired!
Homeowners are familiar with the regular care that their appliances demand - from cleaning to maintenance and repairs. Washing machines, dryers and related appliances are generally expected to last for a long time, but if any problems arise, it’s important to address them quickly. Of the most common issues with a dryer is worn-out drive belts. These belts can stretch, snap and otherwise wear down, leading to certain malfunctions. 

Drive belts are responsible for enabling a dryer to rotate a drum in order to tumble and dry clothing. When a dryer has worn belts, the drum is unable to turn and, consequently, the appliance won’t start. This can be caused by the age of the machine, a lack of lubrication, or any other number of factors. In most cases, a new belt needs to be installed to get a dryer running again. 

Most belts are inexpensive, straightforward to install, and a relatively easy fix, even for homeowners who aren’t familiar with DIY appliance fixes. But finding the correct belt and then making sure it’s properly installed can be tricky if you don’t have experience with small appliance repairs. It’s usually best to call in a trained appliance repair technician to handle the replacement and help perform any other maintenance that may be necessary, such as cleaning and lubricating the pulleys found in the dryer.
