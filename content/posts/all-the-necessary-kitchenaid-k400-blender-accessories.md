## Get the Most Out of Your KitchenAid K400 Blender
Making smoothies, shakes, and other food items has never been easier with the KitchenAid K400 Blender. Get the most from your kitchen appliance with the necessary blender accessories.

The KitchenAid K400 Blender comes standard with a 64-ounce (1.8L) pitcher and a tamper. The pitcher is BPA-free and shatter-resistant, with a clear lid for easy viewing and ergonomic handles for portability. The tamper included with the blender is rubberized and easy to use - great for breaking down tough ingredients and preventing air pockets that can leave ingredients lumpy.

Additional must-have accessories for making the most out of your KitchenAid K400 Blender include silicone spatulas, reusable straws, and a storage container. The spatulas make it easy to scrape the sides of the pitcher while blending, while the reusable straws are a great way to enjoy freshly blended beverages without the mess. Finally, the storage container is perfect for safely storing unused ingredients and finished dishes until theyâ€™re ready to be served.

In addition to these must-have blender accessories, there are several optional KitchenAid K400 Blender accessories that can also be helpful for serious chefs. Blending jars and pitchers in various sizes can make it easier to blend multiple batches of food, while food processors and blades are great for finely chopping, mincing, and pureeing a variety of ingredients.

The KitchenAid K400 Blender is a powerful tool for creating delicious recipes. With the right accessories, you can get the most out of your kitchen appliance and make a wide array of amazing food.
