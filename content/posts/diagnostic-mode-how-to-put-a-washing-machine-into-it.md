## Diagnosing a Washing Machine: How to Put it Into Diagnostic Mode
Keeping our laundry appliances in great running condition is a must, and diagnostic mode can help us determine when repairs need to be done, saving us time and money. Here we provide a quick overview of how to put a washing machine into diagnostic mode and glean important information about its performance.

Diagnostic mode is accessed through the appliance’s control panel, and the steps to enter it are usually found in the appliance’s user guide, and should always be followed in order to ensure that it's done safely. Within diagnostic mode, you will be able to access several different screens that can show information about the appliance’s current operating condition, and any problems it may be experiencing. 

Depending on the type of information you are trying to access, you may need to cycle through several different screens within the diagnostic mode, each providing a different level of data about the appliance’s current status and performance. Fault codes can also be accessed in diagnostic mode and can help identify what types of repairs need to be made. 

If you experience any difficulty when attempting to put your washing machine into diagnostic mode, it is important to consult the appliance's user manual or contact the manufacturer's customer service team to get assistance if needed.

Even with all the advice that we can use to prevent our appliances from needing repairs, there may be times when you need to put a washing machine into diagnostic mode to try and determine what kind of repairs are needed. By following the steps in the appliance’s user guide, you can identify potential issues and get them resolved more quickly so you can get back to washing clothes with ease.
