A pellet stove is a type of heating appliance that uses wood pellets as fuel to generate heat. Pellet stoves are efficient, environmentally friendly, and easy to use. They are a great way to supplement your home’s primary heating system and can even be used as your main source of heat in some cases.

Pellet stoves work by burning wood pellets that are made from compressed sawdust, wood shavings, agricultural waste, and other organic materials. The pellets are fed into the stove via an automated hopper which then feeds the pellets into the fire chamber where they’re burned at a very high temperature. This process produces hot air which is then circulated throughout your home using fans and ducting.

Pellet stoves are incredibly efficient because they burn cleanly and efficiently with very little smoke or emissions being produced. They also require very little maintenance compared to traditional fireplaces and wood-burning stoves since you only need to clean out the ash pan every few weeks or so. Additionally, pellet stoves can be set up with thermostats so that you can control the temperature inside your home easily and conveniently. 

Overall, pellet stoves offer a great way to heat your home efficiently while still being environmentally friendly and low-maintenance. If you’re looking for an alternative heating option for your home, then consider investing in a pellet stove!
