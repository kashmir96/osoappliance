## Common Faults & Solutions for Your Indesit Washing Machine 

**Q: What can cause my washing machine's door to be hard to open?**

A: If the door is hard to open when the washer is finished, check to make sure that the machine is in the unload state. Before opening the door, select a program to ensure the wide open state, which will make the opening easier. Take care when you open the door, as sudden jerks may affect the door seal.

**Q: What do I do if the washing machine does not spin?**

A: First, you should check that the programme has been correctly selected, and that the machine is correctly connected to a functioning electricity socket. Check that the door is properly closed. If the door latch is complete and the water supply is set correctly, then you should try reducing the washing load. 

**Q: Why is my washing machine not draining?**

A: Washing machines may not drain for a variety of reasons. Make sure that the drain hose is correctly inserted into the waste pipe and is not blocked. You should also check that the filter is moist and that the hose from the drum is connected correctly. 

**Q: Can I leave my washing machine powered up when not in use?**

A: Yes, you can leave the appliance powered up when not in use. However, in order to keep your appliance working correctly and avoid any further issues, it is suggested to switch off the power when not in use, especially if you plan to leave it unused for some time. 

**Q: What should I do if my washing machine shakes excessively during the wash cycle?**

A: Excessive shaking and vibrations could be caused by an unbalanced load, or a faulty shock absorber. First, check that the floor is level and that the machine is installed firmly and securely. Then, try evenly distributing the laundry items in the drum and if necessary, adjust the settings on the stabilizers. If this does not solve the problem, the shock absorbers may need to be replaced.
