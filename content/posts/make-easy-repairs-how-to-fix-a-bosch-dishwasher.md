## Quick and Easy Fixes for Your Bosch Dishwasher
When using Bosch dishwashers, having them break down can be a huge disruption to your day-to-day operations. But fear not – there’s no need to contact a professional immediately, as you can often save time and money by doing some easy DIY repairs yourself. Here are a few of the most common issues encountered when using a Bosch dishwasher, and how to fix them.

### Clogged Drain
A clogged drain is the most common issue with a Bosch dishwasher. To unclog a drain, first disconnect the power to the appliance and remove the filters in the bottom. Then, use a drain snake to dislodge the obstruction. Once cleared, simply reassemble the dishwasher and restore power.

### Water Leaks
Most common water leaks take place at the door seal. To remedy this, first remove the screws from around the inside of the door, then lift out the inner panel. Now, you can see the seal. If it has any cuts, it will need to be replaced. Buy a replacement seal, put it in place, and then resecure the screws.

### Door Will Not Close Properly
To fix this issue, begin by making sure that the the rubber feet on the dishwasher are all the same level. If they’re uneven, level them off with a screwdriver. Next, check the gasket and make sure it’s not damaged. If it’s damaged, you will need to replace it.

Finally, you copuld also make sure that all of the dish Rack Trim is securely attached. If any of it is loose, reattach it with a few screws.
