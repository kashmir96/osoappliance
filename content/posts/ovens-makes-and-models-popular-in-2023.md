In 2023, there are several ovens on the market that are popular with consumers. The most common types of ovens available in 2023 are convection ovens, steam ovens and conventional electric wall ovens. 

Convection Ovens
Convection ovens have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to cook food evenly and quickly. Convection ovens use a fan to circulate hot air around the food, which helps it cook faster and more evenly than conventional baking or roasting methods. This type of oven is also great for baking cakes, pies and other desserts as the heat is spread more even throughout the entire product. Many people also choose convection because it uses less energy than traditional methods of cooking, making it cost-effective for households looking to save money on electricity bills. Popular models of convection oven include GE Profile 30" Built-In Single Wall Oven and Samsung 8 cu ft 30" Freestanding Convection Range with Air Fryer. 

Steam Ovens 
Steam ovens are becoming increasingly popular due to their versatility in being able to bake, steam, roast and grill foods all at once. This type of oven utilises up to three times more moisture than a regular conventional electric wall or range top model which results in juicier meats and flakier pastries while still preserving nutrients within the food during cooking. Steam also helps reduce shrinkage when cooking proteins like chicken or fish which means you can end up saving money by buying larger pieces as they will still be full size after cooking! The Miele H6880BP2 24 Inch Speed Oven is a favourite amongst home cooks for its flexibility as well as its sleek design that fits perfectly into any kitchen décor scheme. 

Conventional Electric Wall Oven 
Conventional electric wall models may not be as trendy as some of their flashier counterparts but they remain a staple choice when it comes to choosing an everyday appliance for basic kitchen needs like roasting vegetables or broiling steaks. These days many brands offer variations such as self-cleaning models with built-in sensors that detect when the interior has reached high enough temperatures required for cleaning purposes so you don’t have lift a finger! Popular models include Frigidaire Gallery 24" Single Electric Wall Oven Self Cleaning With True Convectio nand Whirlpool WOS51EC0HS Built-In Electric Double Wall Oven With True Convectio nboth offering modern features such precise temperature control settings that make them much easier (and safer!) to use compared to older models from decades ago! 

Overall there is no one size fits all option when it comes down selecting an ideal appliance for your own individual needs but these three types tend to dominate most households’ kitchens today thanks their convenience factor combined with increased safety features offered by many modern brands on the market today ensuring you get only get top notch quality products every time!
