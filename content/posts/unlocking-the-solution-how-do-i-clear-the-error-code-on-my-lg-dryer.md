## Clearing the Error Code on Your LG Dryer

If your LG dryer is displaying an error code, it can feel like an obstacle to getting your laundry done. Fortunately, the solution isn’t far away—here’s how to identify and clear the error code on your LG dryer.

First, check the manual for your model—it often contains a list of error codes along with their meanings and solutions. If the manual doesn’t offer a solution to your error code, you can try unplugging the dryer for a few minutes and then plugging it back in to see if the error code has gone away.

If the error code persists, try clearing the filter. If the filter is clogged or dirty, it can cause the dryer to overheat and display an error code. Cleaning or replacing the filter should clear the code.

If cleaning the filter doesn’t fix the problem, you may need to take a look at the dryer’s thermostat and cycling thermostat, which have a direct impact on how well the dryer works. Ensure that the temperature settings are correct and that the thermostats are functioning properly by checking for debris or resistance in the electrical connections.

If your problem still isn’t solved, you may need to replace worn or defective parts. Be sure to order replacement parts for your specific LG dryer model.
