## Know Your LG Refrigerator Error Codes

Having an LG refrigerator can often be a convenient solution to storing food, but what do you do when an error arises? LG provides an error code list for their refrigerators that helps diagnose any potential issues your appliance could encounter. Being familiar with these codes can help you understand and troubleshoot anything that might happen to your LG refrigerator. 

Error code lists are often a technical and comprehensive resource that can seem intimidating, but LG has broken down the explanation of their codes into simple and straightforward language. For example, the error code ER FF is referred to as “forced defrosting” and is explained as “the refrigerator automatically defrosts if the evaporator is covered with frost more than 5mm". Some codes might also require a service call for repair, like the code ED, which indicates a compressor error. Understanding the implications of the code will help to determine the course of action needed to get your refrigerator back in working condition. 

On top of just understanding the codes, the LG refrigerator error code list is meant to provide guidance on how to reset the system and continue functioning with minimal issue. It’s important to note that these instructions are all generalized, so be sure to double check your model before attempting any of these reset options. The most common reset methods are:

- Unplugging the power cord
- Switching off the power at the circuit breaker
- Resetting the refrigerator through the control panel

Learning the error code list can be a great way to ensure that you have the know-how to handle any problems that may arise in your LG refrigerator.
