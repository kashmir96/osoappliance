Have you ever cooked a big batch of chicken, only to forget about it in the fridge? If so, you're not alone! Many of us are unaware of how long chicken is good for after being stored in the fridge. 

Raw chicken can stay fresh and safe to eat for up to two days when stored in the refrigerator. This is true for any type of raw poultry that’s been cut into small pieces or large chunks. If the raw chicken is still in its packaging and unopened, it’s typically safe to eat up to four days after its sell-by date. 

Cooked chicken is good for three to four days when stored in the refrigerator. You can also freeze cooked chicken for up to nine months if you need it to stay fresh longer! When freezing, make sure your container or freezer bag is properly sealed and labeled with a date so you know how long ago the food was put away. 

It's important that you store any leftovers from your cooked meals separately from their original containers or packaging as soon as possible – this will help reduce bacteria growth and keep your food fresher longer. Additionally, make sure your refrigerator stays at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below: Anything above this temperature will cause bacteria growth on foods like chicken very quickly. 

If ever unsure about whether a particular batch of prepared or frozen food has gone bad, use your senses: look out for discoloration; smell whether there's an off odor; feel if the texture has changed; and taste a very small amount before eating more (which would be ill-advised). By following these simple steps, you can easily determine how long your cooked and frozen chickens are good for – helping keep both yourself and others healthy over time!
