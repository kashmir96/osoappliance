As carpets are one of the most expensive pieces of furniture in a home, it is important to take care of them properly. One way to do that is to use a carpet cleaner solution. Carpet cleaners remove dirt, dust, and other debris from carpets and rugs, leaving them looking like new. But with so many different types of carpet cleaning solutions on the market, it can be hard to know which one is best for your needs.

For basic cleaning needs, a light detergent solution such as Woolite or Resolve can be used. These solutions are designed to gently clean carpets without damaging the fibers or colors. They are also safe for use around kids and pets as they contain no harsh chemicals or fumes. For tougher stains such as pet urine or red wine stains, you'll need something stronger than just a detergent solution. For these types of stains you may need an enzyme-based cleaner like Nature's Miracle or OdorXit Pro-Cleaner & Odor Eliminator specifically designed for pet urine removal. 

For more heavy duty cleaning needs such as deep steam cleaning or extraction cleaning techniques, professional grade products like Bissell Professional Carpet Cleaner Solution will work best since they contain higher concentrations of active ingredients than lighter duty cleaners do and provide superior results when used in combination with professional equipment/tools (such as deep steam cleaners). If you don't want to purchase professional grade products though there are plenty of high quality consumer grade carpet cleaners available on the market too that will get the job done just fine if combined with proper technique and minimal effort on your part. 

Finally if all else fails and none of these options seem to solve your problem then consider hiring a professional carpet cleaner who has all the necessary tools/products needed for efficiently removing tough stains from carpets without damaging them in any way - this option might end up being more cost effective in some cases compared to purchasing multiple bottles/containers/tanks full of various carpet cleaner solutions since professionals already have their own specialized tools and supplies that come included when they offer their services so you wouldn't have to pay extra for those items separately (unless otherwise specified). So depending on how much time & effort you're willing put into getting your carpets cleaned yourself versus having someone else do it professionally - make sure you weigh both options before making your final decision!
