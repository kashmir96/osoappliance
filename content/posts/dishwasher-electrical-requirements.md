When you are outfitting your kitchen with the latest appliances, it is important to understand the dishwasher electrical requirements. This is essential in order to keep you and your family safe while using this appliance.

A standard dishwasher needs a 120-volt outlet which provides a 15- or 20-amp circuit. The outlet should be grounded with three-pronged cord that has a grounding screw attached. This outlet must be located within 6 feet of where the dishwasher will be installed, so it is important to plan ahead when selecting a location for your dishwasher.

Additionally, if your dishwasher requires more than 12 amps of current, then you will need to install an additional dedicated circuit directly connected to its own breaker in your home's breaker box. This dedicated circuit should also have a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet installed near the appliance for safety reasons. It is important that these steps are taken to ensure that there is no risk of electric shock when using your dishwasher.

Finally, if your model has any electronic components built into it such as electronic touch controls, then you may need an additional 220-volt plug near the unit as well as separate 20-amp dedicated circuit connected directly to its own breaker in the home's main panel box. It is important that you verify what type of power requirements your specific model has before attempting any electrical work on it yourself or hiring someone else for this job. 

By understanding what type of power requirements are needed for different models of dishwashers and taking time to ensure they are met properly, you can rest assured knowing that you have done everything possible from a safety standpoint when installing this vital appliance in your kitchen!
