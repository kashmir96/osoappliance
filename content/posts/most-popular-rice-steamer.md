The rice steamer is one of the most popular kitchen appliances around. This versatile machine can be used to make all kinds of delicious meals, from fluffy white rice to sticky sushi-rice. Rice steamers are easy to use and require minimal effort to get the perfect cooked result. 

Rice steamers work by trapping heat and moisture in a bowl that sits atop a heating element or stovetop burner. There are several types of rice steamers available, from electric models with adjustable timers and settings, to traditional bamboo baskets that were used for centuries in Asian countries. 

Using a rice steamer is simple: just add uncooked rice and water into the bowl (following your specific model’s instructions) and turn it on. Once the water has evaporated, your grains should be cooked through without being overcooked or burnt. The perfect texture is achieved by using just enough water so that it all evaporates during cooking - too little water will cause your grains to be dry, while too much will make them soggy. 

With an electric rice steamer you can also set it to keep warm before serving, which makes it ideal for meal prepping as you can have freshly cooked grain ready whenever you need it! Plus they’re often equipped with additional features such as automatic shut offs or special compartments for adding sauces and spices right into the cooking process for added flavor. 

Rice steamers are incredibly useful in any kitchen – whether you’re looking for quick weeknight dinners or gourmet meals – and they come in a variety of sizes so you can choose one suitable for your needs!
