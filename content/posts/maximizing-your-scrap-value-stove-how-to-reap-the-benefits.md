If you have a scrap value stove, chances are you are already aware of the savings potential. By maintaining your stove, you can reduce the amount of resources needed to heat your property. This means that you can save on lower energy costs, which translates to larger and more consistent savings.

Moreover, regular maintenance of your scrap value stove can also extend its life. Plus, it can boost its performance. Regular use of a scrap value stove can wear the metal quicker due to higher heat. To counter this, you can clean the metal weekly to make sure the stove properly combusts the fuel. This way, it'll continue to be as efficient and effective to cook food as when it was new.

You can also maximize the efficiency of your scrap value stove by proper fuel usage. Choose clean and dry fuel and burn exactly what you need.
