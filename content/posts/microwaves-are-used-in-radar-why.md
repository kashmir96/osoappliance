Radar is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, and velocity of objects. Microwaves are used in radar because they can be transmitted and reflected off objects to create an echo that can be used to measure distances.

Microwaves are ideal for radar because they travel at the speed of light (299,792 km/s) and can penetrate through clouds, rain, snow, and dust. They also have shorter wavelengths than other types of radio waves which means they can detect smaller targets like airplanes or ships. The short wavelength also means that microwaves have a higher resolution than other types of radio waves making them better suited for precise measurements.

Microwaves also have a high frequency which makes them suitable for rapid response times. This is important for military applications where quick reactions are necessary for safety purposes. Additionally, microwaves have the ability to penetrate through most materials allowing radar systems to detect objects even when they’re hidden from view. 

Finally, microwaves are relatively inexpensive compared to other types of radio waves so they’re great for budget-conscious applications like consumer electronics or commercial security systems. 

In conclusion, microwaves are an ideal choice for radar systems due to their high speed of transmission, short wavelengths with high resolution capabilities, ability to penetrate through most materials, and cost efficiency compared to other types of radio waves.
