## Discover the Unrivaled Health Benefits of a Water Filter for Your Family

Investing in a reliable water filter for your family is an essential step to ensure you and your family can consume safe, healthy water. There is a wide range of choices available, but all offer similar benefits that will help you rest easy knowing your family is drinking safe, healthy water. 

The benefits of water filters are far-reaching and no family should overlook them. A quality water filter will help reduce your family’s risk of waterborne sickness caused by toxins and contaminants. The right filter can also help rid your home’s water of things like sediment, rust, chlorine and lead. That same filter can also rid your water of harmful bacteria like E-Coli, Salmonella and Giardia to ensure your family is drinking healthy, bacteria-free and delicious water. 

In addition to reducing the risk of waterborne illness, a properly functioning water filter can also help you save on your water bills. A quality filter will reduce limescale, rust and other contaminants that can potentially damage and wear away at your plumbing over time. This helps reduce clogging and blockages in your pipes and fixtures, resulting in better water pressure and lower monthly water bills.

Ans: By using a water filter, you can remove potentially harmful contaminants from your family’s drinking water such as lead, asbestos and chlorine, as well as other debris like rust, dirt, and other particles that may contribute to illnesses or diseases. A water filter also helps improve the taste and smell of your drinking water and can even contribute to an overall improvement in the health of your family. 

2. Is it necessary to use a water filter even if the tap water seems clean? 
Ans: Even if the water appears clean and clear and meets the safety requirements established by your local water utility, a water filter can improve the drinking water quality in terms of taste, odour and potentially harmful contaminants. In addition, a water filter can protect the family from any unseen contaminants that might be present in the water supply. 

3. What kind of water filter should I get for the best protection? 
Ans: The best protection will depend upon the type of contaminants that need to be removed from the water.

It’s important to do plenty of research to make sure you are getting the best filtration system for your specific needs.

Ans: It depends on the type of water filter you are using. Some water filters require regular maintenance and filter replacements, while others only require occasional cleaning of the filter material when the filter becomes clogged. Make sure to read the instructions on the filter and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for maintenance and filter changes. 

5. How long will my filter last? 
Ans: The life of a filter depends on the filter type, the water quality, and the amount of water running through the filter. Generally speaking, most water filters are designed to last around 4-6 months or 2,000-3,000 gallons, whichever comes first.
