## Replace Revere Ware Handles Easily and Effectively
Replacing the handles on Revere Ware is a common, yet sometimes daunting task. Many may be interested in replacing them but feel concerned about taking apart the kitchen appliances. Fortunately, with the right techniques and skills, replacing the handles is easy and doesnâ€™t require any special tools. 

When replacing Revere Ware handles, the number one thing to keep in mind is to be careful with the hardware. Many of the pieces of hardware used to attach the handles are extremely small, easily misplaced and make it difficult to re-attach the handles correctly. Begin by first removing the screws or nuts that hold the handles in place. You may need to use a tiny flathead screwdriver or a set of needle nose pliers to access the nuts or screws. Once the old handles are off, carefully remove the nuts, screws and other hardware from the pot. 

It's important to take the time to make sure the new handles are secure. Start by measuring the mounting holes of the new handles for the correct size and shape of the screws or nuts. Then, insert the correct connecting hardware. You can tightly fasten the screws or nuts by hand, but it's ideal to use needle nose pliers to secure them. Make sure the replacement handles fit before re-attaching to the pot. The handles should be secure, but not overly tight. 

Replacing Revere Ware handles requires patience and pays off in the end. After the replacement handles are in place, you'll now have the desired look and feel in your kitchen.
