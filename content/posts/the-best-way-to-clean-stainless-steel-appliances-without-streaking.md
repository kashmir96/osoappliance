## Cleaning Stainless Steel Appliances Without Streaks

Keeping your kitchen appliances looking their best can be a challenge, especially when it comes to cleaning stainless-steel. Without the proper supplies and technique, water spots, streaks, and other damaging marks can quickly appear on your stainless steel appliances. However, you can keep your stainless steel appliances sparkling-clean and streak-free with the right cleaning ingredients and methods. 

When cleaning your stainless steel appliances, you’ll want to start by dusting or wiping down the surface with a lightly dampened cloth. This will remove any debris that has settled on the surface. A few drops of mild liquid dishwashing (or laundry detergent) added to the damp cloth can help you do a deeper cleaning. 

If there are more stubborn marks and spots on your stainless steel appliances, you may need to use a stronger cleanser. Don’t worry, you don’t need to use a chemical cleaner, you can make your own natural, streak-free cleaner using equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray this onto the surface, let it sit for a few minutes, and then use a soft cloth to wipe away the dirt and rinse with clean water. 

Avoid using abrasive cleaners and cloths, as this can cause scratches and marks on the stainless steel that can be difficult to remove. Similarly, if you have hard water in your area, you may want to opt for a harder water cleaner that works to reduce the limescale build-up, making it easier to clean larger appliances. 

Once you’ve finished wiping down the surface of your stainless steel appliance, use a dry cloth to wipe off any excess moisture. That way, you’ll be left with spotless, streak-free appliances.

Stainless steel appliances can bring a unique and timeless look to your kitchen. With the right cleaning methods, you can keep them looking their best and streak-free. For more advice on picking out the perfect appliances, check out our [Overview of Top Appliances](./pages/appliance-overview).
