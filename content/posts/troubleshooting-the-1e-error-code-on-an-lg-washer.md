## Repairing an LG Washer 1e Error Code 

Error codes can save you the effort of having to call out for a repairman when something goes wrong with your LG washer. The 1e error code, in particular, is a sure sign your washing machine is in need of some troubleshooting. This can be a scary situation, and learning more about the 1e error code and how best to handle it can help alleviate some of your worries.

The 1e error code indicates that there is a problem with the water supply using hoses on the unit. This could mean there's a high-water level, stopped water flow, pressure switch issue, issue with the drain pump, or a problem with the water inlet control valve. To determine exactly the issue, you'll need to reset the washing machine, disconnect power and water supply, and then follow the troubleshooting steps for each of the issues listed above.

After disconnecting the power and water supply, you'll need to:

1. run some diagnostics by recreating a wash cycle 
2. check that all the hoses and connections are in working order
3. substitute the pressure switch and evaluate the water pressure on the washer
4. check if there's a blockage in the drain pump

If the error code does not stop appearing even after manually draining the washer, inspect the water inlet control valve for clogs, sediment, rust, or any damage. If any of these issues are causing the 1e error code, cleaning the valve or making a replacement may be needed.

If everything checks out, it may be time to call in a certified technician to check the inner component. While this can be an intimidating moment, troubleshooting an error code can help you get a better understanding of whatâ€™s needed to get your LG washer running properly again.
