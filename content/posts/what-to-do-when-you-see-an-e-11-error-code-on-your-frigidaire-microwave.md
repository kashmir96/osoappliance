## Dealing with an E-11 Error Code on Your Frigidaire Microwave

No one wants to deal with their appliances breaking down, least of all their microwave. The good news is that, if it's displaying an E-11 error code, you're not facing a major repair job – Frigidaire microwave E-11 simply means the door is open or ajar. This isn’t a major issue and you can use that to your advantage in troubleshooting the microwave.

The first thing to check for is that the door is properly closed and latched. Ensure that the door is completely shut, that the handle is secure, and that there aren’t any items blocking or preventing the door from completely closing. Sometimes, the hinges and latches simply need a minor adjustment or lubrication in order to securely shut the door.

If the door itself appears to be in good working order, the problem may be elsewhere. Faulty door latches, locks, and switches can cause the same error message. The reset button is also good to check, as it can be triggered when the door is ajar.

Some Frigidaire microwaves are equipped with a safety interlock system, designed to prevent the oven from running when the door is open. The interlock system is important for safety reasons, and if it doesn't engage properly, the E-11 error will be displayed. Possible solutions for this include cleaning the hinges, tightening the connecting screws, and checking the microswitch.

If you’re still having trouble, it may be time to call in an appliance technician. They can do a deeper analysis and pinpoint the exact source of the error. Make sure you review our [Comprehensive Appliance Error Codes Glossary](./error-codes/) for alternative solutions, however, before you make any hasty decisions.
