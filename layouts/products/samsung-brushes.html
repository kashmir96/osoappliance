          <p>Fits various Samsung machine models, please check compatibility with your specific model before purchasing. </p> 
        
          <h2>How to install</h2>
    <p>It’s as easy as unplugging the machine, leaning it over onto a mat, pull off the belt, using a 10mm socket to take out the motor, flick the tab holding the motor brush spring to the side and pull out the old brush. Put the brush in, test spinning the motor (if it’s noisy you may need to take out and put it back in). Repeat the process in reverse to install.</p>
